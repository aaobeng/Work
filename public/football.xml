										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The upcoming presidential election of the Ghana Chess Association has taken a new turn following the submission of two separate formal petitions challenging Christiana Ashley&#8217;s candidacy.</p>



<p>The contest, now widely seen as a straight race between Ashley and David Achempong, has shifted beyond routine electoral competition into a broader debate about governance standards, institutional independence and reputational risk.</p>



<p>Within the official objection window, Association members submitted two documented protests to the Electoral Committee, challenging Ms Ashley’s eligibility.</p>



<p>Both petitions cite adverse findings contained in the report of the Justice Amadu Tanko Committee, which was established after the 2018 Commonwealth Games visa controversy.</p>



<p>The Committee’s report, which remains part of the public record, stated that Ms Ashley’s continued role in sports administration at any level was “no longer tenable.”</p>



<p>Petitioners argue that such a finding cannot be ignored when assessing the suitability of a candidate for the highest office of a national sports federation. They also warn that allowing the candidacy under these circumstances could expose the Association to reputational damage and weaken stakeholder confidence.</p>



<p>Beyond the past findings, concerns have also been raised about Ms Ashley’s employment status.</p>



<p>Stakeholders note that she is a staff member of the National Sports Authority, administratively assigned to the Ghana Chess Association.</p>



<p>Some members have questioned whether it is consistent with good governance for a state-assigned administrative officer within the Association to simultaneously contest for the highest elected leadership position in the same body.</p>



<p>The concerns being raised are largely structural and governance-based. They include whether the arrangement creates a perceived conflict of roles, blurs the distinction between administrative appointment and electoral mandate, and could affect the Association&#8217;s independence.</p>



<p>Observers note that in modern sports governance, perception alone can influence credibility.</p>



<p>Opposing candidate David Achempong is being promoted by supporters as a continuity and reform figure within Ghana Chess.</p>



<p>His backers argue that under his leadership, the Association&#8217;s involvement in the chess ecosystem has grown, with more tournaments and regional activity, increased youth and school participation, stronger visibility, and improved stakeholder engagement.</p>



<p>Supporters insist that the current momentum should not be interrupted by controversy.</p>



<p>Some stakeholders are framing the election as more than a contest between two individuals. Instead, it is being described as a referendum on governance culture within Ghana Chess.</p>



<p>With two formal protests already on record and governance questions now in public view, attention has turned to the Electoral Committee’s decision on eligibility and how delegates weigh ambition against institutional credibility.</p>



<p>As many in the chess community note, every move has consequences — and the decision made in this election could shape Ghana Chess&#8217;s reputation for years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bodo/Glimt&#8217;s fairytale continues as they added Inter Milan to their list of prized scalps to put them within touching distance of a place in the Champions League last 16.</p>



<p>Bodo are still in their off-season in Norway, yet they overpowered Inter in the second half after beating Manchester City and Atletico Madrid last month.</p>



<p>Jens Petter Hauge and Kapser Waarts Hogh struck inside three second-half minutes after Francesco Pio Esposito had cancelled out Sondre Fet&#8217;s opener.</p>



<p>Inter may be eight points clear at the top of Serie A and have been Champions League finalists in two of the last three seasons, but they were made to look ordinary by Bodo in the Arctic Circle.</p>



<p>Bodo took the lead after 20 minutes on their artificial surface when Hogh backheeled the ball for Fet to finish expertly.</p>



<p>Inter responded and former Manchester United defender Matteo Darmian hit the post before Nicolo Barella shot straight at Bodo goalkeeper Nikita Haikin.</p>



<p>Inter&#8217;s pressure paid off and when Carlos Augusto&#8217;s header from Barella&#8217;s cross was blocked, the ball fell to Esposito who turned and fired home.</p>



<p>The visitors and three-time winners were denied by the woodwork again when Lautaro Martinez hit the post before Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer touched Hogh&#8217;s drive over.</p>



<p>Inter did not heed this warning, and Bodo retook the lead on 61 minutes when they countered, and Hogh teed up Hauge on the left to power home a left-footed drive into the top corner.</p>



<p>Inter were stunned, and Bodo took full advantage to score a third when Ole Didrik Blomberg squared the ball for Hogh to tap home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Leaders Arsenal blew a 2-0 lead in dramatic fashion to draw at rock-bottom Wolves and missed the chance to go seven points clear at the top of the Premier League.</p>



<p>Gunners defender Riccardo Calafiori turned in debutant Tom Edozie&#8217;s shot in the fourth minute of added time for a late leveller after goalkeeper David Raya and centre-back Gabriel made a mess of clearing a high ball into the box.</p>



<p>Hugo Bueno had started Wolves&#8217; comeback with a stunning curling effort after Bukayo Saka, with his first goal in 15 games, and Piero Hincapie gave Arsenal what seemed a commanding lead.</p>



<p>The Gunners had control at Molineux as Bukayo Saka<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gje501g51o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;celebrated his new contract with the fifth-minute opener.</a></p>



<p>The England forward nodded in Declan Rice&#8217;s cross &#8211; just a day after signing a fresh five-year deal at the Emirates &#8211; before Hincapie added a 56th-minute second with a smart finish from a Gabriel pass for his first goal for the club.</p>



<p>Yet after Saka &#8211; who ended a 15-game goal drought in all competitions &#8211; went off following treatment, Arsenal struggled under pressure as Hugo Bueno pulled a goal back with a stunning curler in the 61st minute.</p>



<p>Wolves pushed at the end, and when Gabriel got in the way as Raya tried to clear a cross, 19-year-old Edozie, on for his senior debut as a substitute, slammed in a shot that struck Calafiori and went in off the post.</p>



<p>Arsenal were stunned, with tempers frayed at the end after Gabriel Jesus shoved over Yerson Mosquera, as their lead over Manchester City is five points, with Pep Guardiola&#8217;s side having a game in hand.</p>



<p>It was a damaging night for Mikel Arteta&#8217;s men in their quest for a first league title since 2004.</p>



<p>Yet they still remain in the hunt for a quadruple of trophies, also facing City in next month&#8217;s Carabao Cup final, entering the Champions League last 16 (having topped the league phase), and in the FA Cup fifth round.</p>



<p>But this result will once more spark doubts over Arsenal&#8217;s staying power, having finished second in the past three successive seasons.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Wolves-analysis-Strugglers-going-down-fighting-">Wolves analysis: Strugglers going down fighting</h2>



<p>Despite being adrift at the bottom and 17 points from safety, Wolves are still fighting and will still have a say in how this Premier League season finishes.</p>



<p>With an hour gone it was a very different scenario as Arsenal led 2-0 and looked on course to see out a comfortable victory.</p>



<p>But that is when Wolves relaxed and began to play, Hugo Bueno scoring the goal of the game with a cracking effort.</p>



<p>Edozie&#8217;s dream leveller &#8211; a first appearance in senior football marked by a first goal even if Calafiori played his part &#8211; epitomised Wolves&#8217; spirit.</p>



<p>That is all they had left &#8211; and had to find &#8211; under Rob Edwards, with the salvage operation already bleak when he replaced Vitor Pereira in November.</p>



<p>They sensed an Arsenal collapse and scrapped their way to a point &#8211; something that was denied them at Emirates Stadium back in December when Mosquera&#8217;s 90th-minute own goal gave the Gunners a 2-1 success.</p>



<p>This point will matter to boss Edwards, the players and the Molineux faithful.</p>



<p>It has been a fractured place for a long time during the first half of an unhappy season.</p>



<p>Unity has returned recently and refusing to give up against the leaders with a gutsy display will hearten Wolves as they prepare for life in the Championship and build for a Premier League return at the first attempt.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Arsenal-analysis-Pressure-mounts-on-Gunners-yet-again">Arsenal analysis: Pressure mounts on Gunners yet again</h2>



<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/topics/cp99zjx9mv1t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Howell</a></strong>, Football reporter</p>



<p>Arsenal&#8217;s lacklustre performance at Wolves has only heightened the nerves of supporters hoping to see them end their title drought.</p>



<p>Despite leading through Saka&#8217;s close-range header &#8211; his first goal since December &#8211; they lacked flow in attack.</p>



<p>Boss Arteta had again picked Saka in the number 10 role rather than the wing after an impressive performance in the FA Cup win over Wigan &#8211; and it looked as though that decision had the desired effect to get his side&#8217;s frontline firing.</p>



<p>However, despite getting a second goal from Hincapie, Arsenal did not do enough, nor did they look comfortable enough to deny the battling hosts.</p>



<p>This was meant to be a routine win against the league&#8217;s bottom club &#8211; one they had beaten nine successive times since 2021 and scored against for a 37th time on the trot in all competitions.</p>



<p>Raya didn&#8217;t have a save to make in the first half, but Arsenal did not dominate as they should and paid the price.</p>



<p>With games against London rivals Tottenham and Chelsea to follow, the Gunners find themselves under a cloud of uncertainty and whether their title dream will turn into another nightmare.</p>



<p>A trip to second-placed Manchester City will be one of their remaining 11 games and Arteta and his squad will have to finally show they can deal with the pressure in the title run-in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Whats-next-for-these-teams">What&#8217;s next for these teams?</h2>



<p>Rob Edwards takes his Wolves side to Crystal Palace on Sunday, 22 February (14:00 GMT), before hosting Aston Villa on Friday, 27 February (20:00 GMT).</p>



<p>The north London derby at Tottenham awaits Arsenal on Sunday, 22 February (16:30 GMT) and then Chelsea visit the Emirates on Sunday, 1 March (16:30 GMT).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Club Brugge scored a dramatic late equaliser as they twice fought back against Atletico Madrid to leave their Champions League knockout phase play-off tie delicately poised.</p>



<p>The hosts, who trailed 2-0 at the interval to a Julian Alvarez penalty and Ademola Lookman&#8217;s goal, rallied after the break with Raphael Onyedika and Nicolo Tresoldi drawing them level.</p>



<p>Joel Ordonez&#8217;s own goal threatened to undo their efforts until Christos Tzolis drove in an 89th-minute equaliser to round off a see-saw contest.</p>



<p>The visitors had made the perfect start, with Alvarez converting from the spot after home full-back Joaquin Seys mistimed a defensive clearance and was penalised for handling in his own box.</p>



<p>When Lookman bundled in on his European debut for Atletico moments before the interval, against a Club Brugge side he faced while an Atalanta player in September, Diego Simeone&#8217;s side looked on course for a comfortable victory.</p>



<p>However, Nigeria international Onyedika prodded in just after the restart to bring the hosts back into the contest.</p>



<p>And when the impressive Tresoldi levelled on the hour mark, getting across his marker to steer the ball past away goalkeeper Jan Oblak, they looked favourites to complete a remarkable turnaround.</p>



<p>It was certainly no more than Club Brugge deserved with Onyedika twice going close in the first period, when Atletico were guilty of sitting back after going a goal ahead.</p>



<p>Simeone, who had watched his side thrash Barcelona then disappoint in a 3-0 defeat by Rayo Vallecano, looked far from amused in his technical area but the introduction of Alexander Sorloth helped shift the momentum back towards his team.</p>



<p>The Norway international hit the woodwork within four minutes of replacing Antoine Griezmann and went close with another effort before pressuring Ordonez to turn into this own net.</p>



<p>Club Brugge were not to be denied though, with Greek international Tzolis rescuing a draw with an unerring finish.</p>



<p>The return leg takes place in Madrid on Tuesday, 24 February (20:00 GMT), with the winners facing Liverpool or Tottenham in the last 16.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Benfica claim there is a &#8220;defamation campaign&#8221; against Gianluca Prestianni after Uefa launched an investigation into claims he racially abused Real Madrid winger Vinicius Jr.</p>



<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Tuesday&#8217;s Champions League tie at Benfica was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cpv843x1zgzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">halted for 10 minutes</a> after Vinicius reported alleged racist abuse to referee Francois Letexier, and he and his teammates left the field.</span></p>



<p>Brazil international Vinicius, who has been a victim of numerous incidents of racist abuse during his playing career, later said in a post on Instagram: &#8220;Racists are, above all, cowards.&#8221;</p>



<p>Prestianni, who could face a minimum 10-match ban from European competition if found guilty, denied directing racial abuse at Vinicius.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Benfica defended Prestianni in a post on their official X account, along with a video of the alleged incident, saying: &#8220;Given the distance, the Real Madrid players could not have heard what they claim to have heard.&#8221;</p>



<p>The club added they &#8220;fully support&#8221; and believe the version of events presented by Prestianni.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Prestianni&#8217;s] conduct in the service of the club has always been guided by respect for opponents, institutions and the principles that define Benfica&#8217;s identity,&#8221; Benfica added.</p>



<p>&#8220;The club regrets the defamation campaign of which the player has been a victim.&#8221;</p>



<p>Benfica manager Jose Mourinho has been criticised for comments he made after the match, including saying Vinicius had been disrespectful in his goal celebration.</p>



<p>Former referee Mark Clattenburg, who was a pundit for the match on Amazon Prime, apologised on Wednesday for his &#8220;clumsy&#8221; comments on the incident.</p>



<p>Clattenburg said Vinicius had &#8220;not helped himself&#8221; and made things difficult for the referee.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing justifies racism in sport or in life. I&#8217;m grateful to have a chance to follow up on last night. I got it wrong, I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; the 50-year-old <a href="https://x.com/clattenburg1975/status/2024173363187368123">posted on X., external</a></p>



<p>&#8220;It was live TV, my job is to respond to the moment, and the words I used were clumsy and not right.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m already learning from this and appreciate my colleagues who covered the situation with class throughout.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Discrimination-is-one-thing-gaslighting-is-another-the-reaction">&#8216;Discrimination is one thing, gaslighting is another&#8217; &#8211; the reaction</h2>



<p>Mourinho said in his post-match interview that he had been told different things by Vinicius and Prestianni regarding the incident.</p>



<p>The Portuguese, who managed Real for 178 games between 2010 and 2013, pointed to their legendary striker Eusebio as proof that Benfica is not a racist club.</p>



<p>&#8220;The club reaffirms, clearly and unequivocally, its historical and unwavering commitment to defending the values of equality, respect and inclusion, which are in line with the core values of its foundation and have Eusebio as their greatest symbol,&#8221; Benfica said.</p>



<p>Mourinho&#8217;s and Benfica&#8217;s comments have been criticised by several people, including anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.</p>



<p>Kick It Out chair Sanjay Bhandari said both the club and manager had &#8220;failed&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a natural inclination to want to believe your player, but the reality is they didn&#8217;t hear it,&#8221; Bhandari told BBC Sport.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only two people who are in that conversation and two people who could have heard what was said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think the better reaction from a club with Benfica&#8217;s fantastic stature would be to say we&#8217;re going to cooperate with the investigation.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is quite typical after these kinds of discriminatory events. The discrimination is one thing, the gaslighting is another.&#8221;</p>



<p>FIFA president Gianni Infantino said he was &#8220;shocked and saddened&#8221; by the incident and commended Letexier for activating the anti-racism protocol.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is absolutely no room for racism in our sport and in society &#8211; we need all the relevant stakeholders to take action and hold those responsible to account,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will always continue to reiterate: No to racism, no to any form of discrimination!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz remain on course to meet in the Qatar Open final after both claimed straight-set wins on Wednesday.</p>



<p>World number two Sinner beat Australia&#8217;s Alexei Popyrin 6-3 7-5 to reach the quarter-finals in Doha, before Alcaraz won 6-2 7-5 against France&#8217;s Valentin Royer.</p>



<p>The pair met in six finals last year, three of them at Grand Slams, with world number one Alcaraz winning the French and US Opens.</p>



<p>The 22-year-old Spaniard will next face Karen Khachanov, who beat Marton Fucsovics 6-2 4-6 6-4.</p>



<p>Sixth seed Jakub Mensik breezed past Zhang Zhizhen 6-3 6-2 to set up a last-eight meeting with Sinner, who has now reached at least the quarter-finals in 28 of his past 30 tournaments, stretching back to the 2023 ATP Finals in Turin.</p>



<p>The 24-year-old Italian, who lifted last year&#8217;s Australian Open and Wimbledon titles, has now won 22 of his past 23 matches. His only defeat came against Novak Djokovic in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/clyn9l0zvnpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Open semi-finals last month.</a></p>



<p>Meanwhile, Greece&#8217;s Stefanos Tsitsipas upset world number 11 Daniil Medvedev 6-3 6-4 in Doha to book a clash with fifth seed Andrey Rublev, who beat Fabian Marozsan 6-2 6-4.</p>



<p>The unseeded Frenchman Arthur Fils and Czech Jiri Lehecka, seeded eighth, complete the quarter-final line-up having also claimed comfortable victories.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Phillipe Coutinho says he is leaving boyhood club Vasco da Gama because he is &#8220;tired mentally&#8221; and his &#8220;cycle at the club has ended&#8221;.</p>



<p>The former Liverpool and Barcelona midfielder was substituted at half-time after being booed by fans during Vasco&#8217;s win on penalties over Volta Redonda last week.</p>



<p>Coutinho, who has 68 caps for Brazil, did not return to the bench in the second half to watch the remainder of the game.</p>



<p>In a lengthy, emotional statement on Instagram, the 33-year-old says he is leaving Vasco because &#8220;now is the time to take step back&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would never disrespect the fans, my team-mates and Vasco. I&#8217;ve never done that anywhere I&#8217;ve been. Those who know me know that,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;At that moment, on the way to the locker room, I felt and realised that my cycle at the club had ended, and I didn&#8217;t come back to prioritise my mental health.</p>



<p>&#8220;It hurts a lot. The truth is that I&#8217;m very tired mentally. With a tight heart, I understand that now is the time to take a step back and end this cycle in Vasco.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful for everything I&#8217;ve lived here. I&#8217;ll take Vasco with me forever. In the chest. In history. In life.&#8221;</p>



<p>Vasco have not confirmed Coutinho&#8217;s departure, but BBC Sport have reached out for comment.</p>



<p>Coutinho has played 81 times and scored 17 goals for Vasco since rejoining for a second stint in 2024.</p>



<p>He started his career at Vasco, then joined Inter Milan and later moved to Liverpool in 2013.</p>



<p>He scored 54 goals in 201 games for the Reds before joining Barcelona for £142m in 2018.</p>



<p>He later had stints at Bayern Munich, Aston Villa and Al-Duhail before returning to Vasco.</p>



<p>&#8220;I chose to go back to Vasco because I love this club. I love everything that Vasco represents in my life,&#8221; added Coutinho.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wearing this shirt was one of the most important choices I&#8217;ve ever made. And, in every training session, in every game, I gave my best. Always!&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghanaian track and field athlete Doris Quainoo delivered a standout performance at the Jarvis City Invite (also known as the Jarvis Scott Invitational) in Lubbock, Texas, over the weekend of February 13-14, 2026, showcasing her steady improvement and competitive spirit in the women’s 60m hurdles.</p>



<p>Representing the University of South Florida (USF) Bulls, the junior from Gomoa Dawurampong, Ghana, progressed impressively through each round of the event. <br></p>



<p>In the preliminaries, Quainoo placed ninth with a time of 8.55 seconds. She bounced back strongly in the semifinals, securing third place and clocking 8.31 seconds, a clear step forward. </p>



<p>The final proved to be her breakthrough moment; Quainoo surged to second place overall, crossing the line in a new personal best of 8.23 seconds.</p>



<p>The consistent drops in her times highlighted her ability to build momentum under pressure and refine her technique mid-competition.</p>



<p>Quainoo’s achievement added a bright spot to an already strong showing for the USF track and field program, which set three new program records and claimed multiple podium finishes across the two-day meet.</p>



<p>On the men’s side, Markel Jones dominated the 60m hurdles, winning the final in 7.67 seconds after strong prelim (7.77) and semi (7.71) runs. Nathan Metelus broke the program record in the 200m with 20.66 seconds (finishing second overall), while Karim Belmahdi set a new mark in the 800m at 1:49.6. <br></p>



<p>The men’s 4x400m relay team, featuring Devontie Archer, Metelus, Alexavier Monfries, and Jones, stormed to first place and another program record with 3:03.82.</p>



<p>Other notable results included Mercy Angaamchaab’s second-place finish in the women’s 800m (2:10.24), and solid contributions across sprints, field events, and relays that underscored the Bulls’ depth and rising form this indoor season.</p>



<p>The performance comes amid USF’s recent success, including back-to-back American Athletic Conference Indoor Championships in 2024 and 2025, plus the 2024 AAC Outdoor title. The program has produced numerous All-Americans and continues to build under head coach Erik Jenkins.</p>



<p>For Quainoo, a hurdles specialist who has represented Ghana internationally and previously competed at the collegiate level before transferring to USF, this PB in the 60m hurdles marks another step in her development as she balances academic pursuits with elite athletics.</p>



<p>The Bulls now turn their attention to the Tampa Classic on February 21 to kick off the outdoor season, followed by the American Indoor Championships from February 26-28 in Birmingham, Alabama. With momentum like this, USF and Quainoo, look poised for more breakthroughs ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ghana Football Association’s announcement of a pre-World Cup friendly against Mexico in May should have been reassuring news. On the surface, it signals ambition, a chance for the Black Stars to test themselves against one of the tournament’s co-hosts. However, the timing of the fixture has sparked genuine concern.</p>



<p>Ghana are already scheduled to face Austria and Germany in March as part of preparations for the FIFA World Cup in June. However, the newly announced clash against Mexico is set for May 22, a date that falls outside the FIFA international window. That detail cannot be ignored. </p>



<p>The rest and release period for the FIFA World Cup 2026 will begin on Monday, 25 May 2026, with exceptions for players involved in the final matches of confederation club tournaments, as approved by FIFA, up to and including 30 May 2026.</p>



<p>Playing outside the FIFA calendar means clubs are under no obligation to release their players. In practical terms, Ghana could head into what is supposed to be a crucial World Cup tune-up without several key members of the squad. With most major European leagues still in season by May 22, the risk of losing important players is not hypothetical; it is very real.</p>



<p>After missing out on AFCON in Morocco, a major opportunity to fine-tune the team in competitive conditions, these friendlies are no longer just routine exhibitions. They represent the only meaningful platform for head coach Otto Addo to refine tactics, test combinations, and build chemistry ahead of the World Cup. That makes the possibility of an incomplete squad even more troubling.</p>



<p>With just weeks to the tournament, friendlies of this magnitude should be used to solidify plans with the core group expected to board the plane, not to stage another round of auditions.</p>



<p>Last year’s Unity Cup in London offers a cautionary example. Ghana were without regulars such as Mohammed Kudus, Thomas Partey, Antoine Semenyo and Alexander Djiku. Eleven players who featured in that mini tournament did not return for the next four competitive fixtures, raising serious questions about the long-term value of the exercise. In fact, only one of those absentees, Abu Francis, eventually reappeared during the friendlies against South Korea and Japan in November 2025.</p>



<p>On paper, the Black Stars have lined up high-quality opposition in the build-up to the World Cup. In reality, constant squad changes, whether due to poor fixture planning or player unavailability, have made it difficult to assess how beneficial these games truly are.</p>



<p>The situation is already complicated by injury concerns. Mohammed Kudus is set to miss the March friendlies against Austria and Germany, and there is a strong possibility he will also be unavailable for the Mexico clash, with Tottenham Hotspur scheduled to play during that same week. If that happens, a player almost certain to start all three group matches at the World Cup could miss the last five high-profile preparatory games.</p>



<p>Yes, Ghana are not the only nation arranging friendlies during unconventional windows. But Ghana’s context is different. Having missed AFCON and with limited opportunities left to prepare, every match carries extra weight. That is why the planning must be precise, and why the Mexico fixture, as currently scheduled, raises more questions than confidence.</p>

<p>At the final whistle, GCAA secured a solid 2:0 victory, the perfect start to their title defence and a strong statement to the rest of the league. </p>



<p>JoyWith such an assured performance in the opening games, GCAA have once again positioned themselves as serious contenders, sending a clear message across the competition, the champions are here, focused, and ready to dominate.</p>

<p>Black Stars head coach Otto Addo delivered a lecture to students of the University of Ghana’s Department of Physical Education and Sports at the Rugby Stadium as part of a special colloquium themed “Individual Player Development.”</p>



<p>Speaking at the event, Otto Addo said it has always been an honour to give back to students and share his experiences.</p>



<p>“I am happy to connect with universities. When I was working in Dortmund, we had good collaboration with students,” he said.</p>



<p>His lecture focused on player development, particularly how young, talented players can be given the right guidance during the transitional phase of breaking into the first team.</p>



<p>“I decided to pick a topic for young players in this transitional era, when they are trying to make it into the first team,” he explained.</p>

<p>“Football has moved beyond just playing on the field. It’s also about learning beyond the field and using science-backed knowledge to understand why certain things happen,” he said.</p>



<p>The Head of Department at the University of Ghana’s Department of Physical Education, Annabella Osei Tutu, said the students were inspired by Addo’s presentation.</p>



<p>“The students are highly motivated and inspired by Otto Addo’s career trajectory,” she noted.</p>



<p>The colloquium is designed to help students recognise the great opportunities available to them in the sports industry.</p>

<p>The Allied Health Professions Council (AHPC) has advised and cautioned the Ghana Football Association (GFA) to produce the foreign credentials and certifications of all physiotherapists and physiotherapy assistants who have been engaged by the association to be verified by the Council for registration and licensing to practice their profession in Ghana.</p>



<p>By a letter dated 16th February 2026 and addressed to the President of the Ghana Football Association, Prof.Shirazu Issahaku, the Registrar of the Council cautioned and advised the GFA to respect the Health Professions Act, Part 1 2013 (Act 857), Section 21 (C) which makes it an offence for any person to practice or profess to practice as an Allied Health Professional without prior registration.</p>



<p>In regards to same, the AHPC has cautioned the GFA to register Mr Carlos Lozano Romero and any other foreign Physiotherapist or Physiotherapist Assistant with the AHPC for an appropriate licence to be issued before undertaking any physiotherapy-related duties in Ghana.</p>



<p>According to Prof Shirazu Issahaku, that is the standard procedure for Allied Health Professionals, either practising at home in Ghana or trading their professions abroad, and the same should be respected by all authorities and agencies to safeguard the Ghanaian health population.</p>

<p><strong>About Mr Carlos Lozano Romero</strong></p>



<p>The Spanish physiotherapist rejoined the Ghana Black Stars this February ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup this summer.</p>



<p>Lozano, who was part of the national team’s backroom staff during Ghana’s 2022 World Cup campaign in Qatar, is expected to bring continuity to the squad, focusing on player recovery, injury prevention, and overall physical conditioning.</p>



<p>He will collaborate closely with the technical and medical teams to maintain players in peak condition throughout the World Cup preparation phase and the tournament itself.</p>



<p>His prior experience at the international level is seen as a valuable asset as Ghana faces some of the world’s strongest teams.</p>



<p>Lozano will report to head coach Otto Addo as the Black Stars aim for a competitive showing on the global stage.</p>



<p>The Black Stars are scheduled to regroup in March for friendly matches against Austria and Germany as part of their World Cup build-up.</p>



<p>Drawn in Group L alongside Panama, England, and Croatia, Ghana will be looking to advance past the group stage, having exited at this point in both the 2014 and 2022 tournaments.</p>

<p>The Black Starlets recorded a narrow 1-0 victory over Division One League leaders Port City FC in a preparatory friendly ahead of the upcoming U17 Africa Cup of Nations.</p>



<p>Captain Joseph Narbi proved the difference, finishing off a slick team move shortly after kickoff to score what turned out to be the only goal of the game.</p>



<p>His early strike settled the Starlets and set up a competitive contest that offered a useful test of the team’s organisation and sharpness for head Coach Prosper Nartey Ogum’s side.</p>



<p>Port City, who currently lead Zone Three, responded with purpose, pressing high and maintaining a disciplined structure in possession.</p>



<p>Their intensity pushed the national U17 side to stay compact and focused throughout the encounter.</p>



<p>The match forms part of Ghana’s preparations for the 2026 U17 Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco in April, with the technical team prioritising competitive friendlies to fine-tune match fitness and assess squad depth.</p>



<p>The Starlets are expected to take on Semper Fi later as part of plans to ensure adequate game time for the entire squad while simulating tournament conditions.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Youth and Sports of Mali has reportedly called on the Malian Football Federation (FEMAFOOT) to dismiss head coach Tom Saintfiet following the country’s disappointing campaign at the Africa Cup of Nations.</p>



<p>Mali’s early exit from the continental tournament has sparked criticism from supporters and officials, with the Sports Ministry said to be pushing for changes to the technical bench as part of a broader restructuring of the national team.</p>



<p>The development comes just days after Saintfiet publicly denied reports suggesting he had stepped down from his role. The Belgian coach insisted he remained committed to the job and was focused on rebuilding the team despite the AFCON setback.</p>



<p>FEMAFOOT is yet to issue an official statement on the Ministry’s reported request, leaving uncertainty over Saintfiet’s immediate future in charge of the Eagles.</p>

<p>Ghana international Andrew Ayew says he has no plans of retiring soon as long as his body continues to deliver.</p>



<p>The 36-year-old recently joined Dutch side NAC Breda after being a free agent for the first half of the 2025/26 season.</p>



<p>Prior to moving to the Netherlands, Ayew had played for Le Havre in the 2024/25 campaign where he recorded four goals and one assist in 27 appearances in Ligue 1.</p>



<p>While he continues to make strides in club football, the forward has not played for national team since returning from the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Côte d’Ivoire.</p>



<p>Ayew, quizzed on his retirement plans in an interview with ESPN, said, “I never thought about it because my body is good. I feel good, I live my life day to day so I prepare myself every time to have a better tomorrow on the field and off the field.</p>



<p>“I don’t think about that. When the moment comes, your body will tell you (to retire).”</p>



<p>Ayew has started one out of the six games he has played since signing for NAC Breda in January.</p>

<p>Coach Christopher Nimley has described the Black Stars’ technical bench as “one of the weakest” among teams heading to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, calling for the immediate dismissal of head coach Otto Addo.</p>



<p>Speaking on the Jupay Podcast, Coach Nimley argued that Ghana risks underperforming on the global stage unless urgent changes are made to the team’s technical leadership.</p>



<p>“I am not convinced that the current team is good enough. I have looked at not only our group in the World Cup, but I have compared our technical team to close to 90 percent of the teams in the World Cup, and our bench is one of the weakest going into the tournament. There’s no pedigree, no establishment,” he said.</p>

<p>“I would sack Coach Otto Addo immediately if I had my way. The Black Stars job is so attractive and lucrative that once I open the market for that job, you will see the quality,” he said.</p>



<p>Coach Otto Addo, a former Ghana international, first assumed leadership of the Black Stars in 2022 on an interim basis after Ghana’s disappointing Africa Cup of Nations campaign. He successfully guided the team past Nigeria in the World Cup playoffs to secure qualification for the 2022 tournament in Qatar.</p>

<p>After stepping down post-Qatar due to family and club commitments, he was reappointed by the Ghana Football Association (GFA) as part of a rebuilding agenda aimed at restoring confidence in the national team. His return was positioned as a move to ensure continuity while integrating younger talents into the squad.</p>



<p>However, performances since his reappointment have drawn mixed reactions from fans and analysts, with questions lingering over tactical identity, squad depth and consistency.</p>

<p>Shortly after Ghana sealed qualification for the 2026 World Cup, Sports Minister Kofi Adams publicly acknowledged concerns about Addo’s performance, even while crediting him for achieving qualification.</p>



<p>In an interview with Evans Mensah on JoyNews, the Minister said:</p>



<p>“Well, he has been lucky, but there are still concerns. Concerns that he himself most times when we meet, he will admit &#8211; maybe I should have done a substitution, or I should have urged them on, or I should have fielded this person to play this role. So there are concerns. But I must say he’s been lucky. It doesn’t mean that he shouldn’t improve.”</p>



<iframe width="850" height="750" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0lNhEmoY3qw" title="Jupay Podcast Live Episode 1: Is The Black Stars Ready For The World Cup?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>Mr. Adams stopped short of questioning the coach’s competence outright.</p>



<p>“I can’t say that he’s totally incompetent. I can’t use that word because I’m not a coach, I’m only a minister who loves the game and analyses it. Other coaches can describe whether he’s competent or not. But I’m not satisfied, that’s all that I’m seeking to say.”</p>



<p>He stressed that decisions about retaining or dismissing the coach rest with the Ghana Football Association, not the Ministry.</p>



<p>“There’s a federation that we have handed over our national team to manage &#8211; that’s the Ghana Football Association. They have a role to play. So I cannot sit here and be talking about whether we are retaining or dismissing the coach.”</p>

<p>The Minister’s remarks, made at a moment of national celebration, underscored the uneasy balance between qualification success and lingering doubts about performance.</p>



<p>Coach Nimley went beyond tactical criticism, alleging that Addo was reluctant to apply for the role when it was opened for applications.</p>



<p>“No wonder he himself knew from day one that he wouldn’t be chosen for the job. So when the application was opened, he himself knew he was not qualified for the job and did not apply for it. He did not apply; he was told to apply for it,” he claimed.</p>

<p>The outspoken coach insisted he has consistently doubted Mr Addo’s suitability for the job.</p>



<p>“To be honest, everybody knows my stance when it comes to Otto Addo. I think he is not good enough. I will not take him to the World Cup, and I am not going to back down on that stand.”</p>



<p>Central to Nimley’s concerns is his assessment of Ghana’s technical team compared to other nations preparing for the World Cup.</p>



<p>“I am not convinced that the current team is good enough. I have looked at not only our group in the World Cup, but I have compared our technical team to close to 90 percent of the teams in the World Cup, and our bench is one of the weakest going into the tournament. There’s no pedigree, no establishment.”</p>



<p>He further argued that Ghana has lacked a proper competitive benchmark ahead of the tournament &#8211; particularly at AFCON &#8211; denying the nation what he considers a crucial opportunity to evaluate the team before June 2026.</p>

<p>“For the fact that he has given us no opportunity whatsoever to properly assess our team before going for the World Cup, we are only sitting on a time bomb waiting to explode. The AFCON should have been the yardstick for Ghana to assess the Black Stars ahead of the World Cup.”</p>



<p>When asked what should be done at this stage, Nimley’s answer was unequivocal:</p>



<p>“Sack him.”</p>



<p>In early February 2026, the Ghana Football Association moved to strengthen the Black Stars’ technical structure ahead of the World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.</p>



<p>French tactician Alain Ravera has been appointed Assistant Coach and will work alongside Black Queens head coach Kim Lars Björkegren.</p>



<p>Spanish coach José Daniel Martínez Alfonso has been drafted in to boost scouting and match preparation, while physiotherapist Carlos Lozano Romero returns to reinforce the medical department. British-born Ghanaian performance specialist Dwayne Peasah Paa Kwesi has also been named Performance Coach.</p>



<p>The GFA says the appointments are intended to ensure a balanced and competitive technical structure as Ghana prepares for the global showpiece.</p>



<p>Yet, despite the reinforcements and ministerial caution, Nimley remains resolute that only a change at the very top will address what he describes as structural weakness.</p>



<p>With the World Cup drawing closer, the debate over Addo’s leadership continues to intensify &#8211; pitting calls for stability against demands for drastic reform at the helm of the Black Stars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Accra Hearts of Oak has filed a complaint with FIFA against South African side Siwelele Football Club for tapping up its player, Hamza Issah.</p>



<p>In a statement on Wednesday, the club said it was &#8220;alarmed by the conduct of Siwelele Football Club of South Africa, which engaged the player, issued an invitation and facilitated travel arrangements without notifying or seeking the consent of Hearts of Oak, despite the existence of an active contract.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This constitutes player inducement and unlawful interference with a subsisting contractual relationship, in clear violation of FIFA Regulations.&#8221;</p>



<p>The statement comes amidst reports of the player&#8217;s imminent move to the South African side.</p>



<p>However, Hearts insist that the player is still under contract.</p>



<p>&#8220;As of today, no competent judicial, regulatory or arbitral body, including the Ghana Football Association’s Player Status Committee or FIFA, has issued any ruling or confirmation that the said contract has been lawfully terminated.&#8221;</p>



<p>In December, Issah&#8217;s representatives threatened to terminate his contract, accusing the club of not paying the player for three months.</p>



<p>While Hearts have not admitted to such contractual breaches, the club admits it has been in talks with Issah and his representatives to settle &#8220;outstanding concerns.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The club has not defaulted persistently or materially on its contractual obligations in a manner that would constitute just cause for unilateral termination under the FIFA Regulations. Following correspondence with the player&#8217;s representatives, the club met with the player on two separate occasions and acted in good faith to address and resolve all outstanding concerns.</p>



<p>Hamza Issah has scored 4 goals in 20 league matches this season.</p>

<p>Ghana international Andre Ayew has revealed his motive to move to the Dutch League was to continue playing at the highest level. </p>



<p>Ayew joined NAC Breda during the January transfer window on a deal until the end of the season, having been involved in personal training since being released by Le Havre. </p>



<p>The 36-year-old had become a free agent after his contract with the Ligue 1 side expired at the end of last season. He featured in 27 league games for the club, scoring four goals and providing one assist. </p>



<p>The forward says the rationale behind his move to the Eredivisie was to challenge himself after his spell in France. </p>



<p>&#8220;I am a footballer, and I always want to play at the highest level. The Dutch league is a very good league, technically, physically…,&#8221; he said in an interview with ESPN. </p>



<p>&#8220;I was looking at challenging myself again, like I did in Le Havre the last two years, where I could bring something to the table and where the belief is mutual from both sides.</p>



<p>&#8220;The club has big objectives for now and the future, and for me, it was important to feel the desire from the club, from the coach, which was very important and the fan base. I am a player who plays a lot with energy, and the fans behind me, so when you are in a club where you have a good fan base and a stadium that makes noise, it’s better for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Since his move to NAC Breda, Ayew has featured six times for the club in the league, starting just one of those games. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Veteran Ghanaian journalist, Osei Owusu Bempah has attributed the ongoing challenges of Asante Kotoko SC to what he describes as managerial and structural deficiencies within the club.</p>



<p>According to him, the core problem facing the Porcupine Warriors is not merely technical or player-related, but deeply rooted in how the club is managed and organized.</p>



<p>He argued that Kotoko is not well structured administratively, insisting that without a clear and efficient management system, it will be difficult for the club to achieve sustained success.</p>



<p>“Kotoko problems, as far as I&#8217;m concerned, are purely managerial; managerial beginning from the ownership through to the last person who goes to support the club,&#8221; he told Luv FM,</p>



<p>“The team is not well structured compared to some of the other clubs that we see around the continent. Again, there&#8217;s also not so much investment in the team.</p>



<p>“Years ago, Kotoko could do with training pitches such as what you used to call cricket and the military pitches. These days have changed, and you cannot continue to rely on facilities such, for example, Adoko Jachie and some of the mediocre places to get the results that you need.</p>



<p>“Kotoko doesn&#8217;t have a place, for example, to call its own in terms of administration, a well fitted administrative office or whatever it is. The team doesn’t seem to have been taking that direction.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotoko, who are now outside the top four after defeat to Hearts of Oak in the Super Clash, will be eager to respond when they face Young Apostles on Matchday 23.</p>

<p>Ghana Football Association President Kurt Okraku says he has no &#8220;problem&#8221; with the Black Stars budget being made public but questions the rationale behind it when &#8220;there is no need for confusion&#8221;.</p>



<p>In February 2025, while speaking on the floor of Parliament during the State of the Nation Address, President John Mahama signaled an end to the era of “secrecy” regarding how much the government spends on national teams and charged the Sports Ministry to make budgets public.</p>



<p>Sector Minister Kofi Adams disclosed the government&#8217;s decision to slash the budget from $2 million to $1.3 million for the September 2025 World Cup qualifiers and is expected to make public the budget for the main competition, which kicks off on June 11, 2026.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don’t have any problem with making the Black Stars budget public,&#8221; Kurt told Asaase Radio.</p>



<p>&#8220;But why are we not asking every sector of the economy to make their budgets public, and why only Black Stars?</p>



<p>&#8220;Why create confusion where there’s no need for confusion? The GFA is a private entity.</p>



<p>&#8220;We dwell and waste our time on things which are needless.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Black Stars will take on Panama on June 17 before subsequently battling England and Croatia in Group L.</p>



<p>Before that, the senior national team will face Austria on March 27 and, three days later, battle Germany before playing Mexico on May 22 as part of preparations for the global showpiece.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Two Ghanaian para swimmers, Promise Atsu and Bryan Baffour, have jetted off to Australia for the World Series 2026.</p>



<p>The duo departed Ghana on Tuesday evening for the competition, slated for February 20–22 at the Gold Coast Aquatic Centre.</p>



<p>Promise and Bryan will undergo international classification and compete in the event, which serves as a qualifying pathway toward the 2026 Commonwealth Games.</p>



<p>Both athletes will compete in the 50m Freestyle, 50m Breaststroke, and 100m Breaststroke.</p>



<p>It is the first time Ghana will be represented at a major competition in para swimming.</p>



<p>The trip, which is understood to be funded by the Ghana Olympic Committee, marks a significant milestone for the Para Swimming Association, headed by Farida Iddriss, who became president in May 2025.</p>

<p>In a statement released, the National Paralympic Committee said: “Madam Farida Idriss, President of the Ghana Para Swimming Association, played a critical role in ensuring that these young para swimmers secured this life-changing opportunity.</p>



<p>“Her leadership, advocacy, and determination have opened new doors for para swimming development in Ghana.</p>



<p>“As the athletes prepare to compete in Australia, Ghana proudly stands behind them and hopes they will achieve qualification and continue to inspire a new generation of para swimmers across the country.”</p>

<p>Veteran Ghanaian sports journalist and administrator, Osei Owusu Bempah has described the steady decline of Asante Kotoko as worrying, and that the once-dominant club has fallen behind its peers in terms of development and progress.</p>



<p>The Porcupine Warriors had their head coach Karim Zito resigning few days before game against Hearts of oak, a development that highlights technical crisis at the club.</p>



<p>The club went on to lose to Hearts of Oak on Sunday in the Super Clash, which has prompted widespread criticism of the Kotoko management.</p>



<p>“Quite sad and regretful, some of the things that I&#8217;ve seen Kotoko go through the last decade, and probably more suddenly, Bempah said in an interview with Luv FM.</p>



<p>“I saw growing up as a child, a Kotoko team that was competing with the best on the continent, Al Ahly, Zamalek, all these other clubs.</p>



<p>“Kotoko won the second African Cup in 1983 at the time that Al Ahly had just won once, and none of the North African teams had won even more than one at a time and now, about 40 years down the line, we fallen behind.</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m talking behind in terms of development, in terms of almost everything that makes football team attractive, probably something that will take the team Kotoko, probably the next century to be able to overcome; it&#8217;s quite sad,” he added.</p>

<p>The Black Stars will face Mexico in what will be their third international friendly ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.</p>



<p>Ghana will lock horns with Austria on March 27 at Vienna’s Ernst Happel Stadium before taking on Germany in their second friendly on March 30 in Stuttgart.</p>



<p>The match against Mexico will take place on May 22 at a yet-to-be-announced venue in the North American nation.</p>



<p>Both countries will use the match to further assess their squads for the World Cup in Mexico, Canada, and the United States.</p>



<p>The aforementioned date falls during a period when the majority of European leagues are still in session, including the English Premier League and Spanish La Liga, which will conclude on May 24.</p>



<p>As a result, the FA said the squad will be &#8220;composed of players in the domestic league [in Ghana], some U-23 players&#8221; and others in the &#8220;European leagues that are watched by [Black Stars coach Otto Addo]&#8221;.</p>



<p>The most recent friendly between Ghana and Mexico was in October 2023, which ended in a 2-0 defeat against the Black Stars, who failed to register a shot on target under head coach Chris Hughton.</p>



<p>Mexico will kick off their campaign against South Africa on June 11 before facing either South Korea, Czech Republic, Denmark, Republic of Ireland, or North Macedonia in the other Group A matches.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Black Stars will take on Panama on June 17 before subsequently battling England and Croatia in Group L.</p>



<p>Ghana is also expected to face &#8220;two other unnamed opponents&#8221; before the World Cup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghanaian coach Christopher Nimley has warned that the Black Stars are &#8220;sitting on a time bomb&#8221; under head coach Otto Addo as the team prepares for the FIFA World Cup.</p>



<p>He insists urgent action is needed to avert what he believes could be a disastrous campaign.</p>



<p>Speaking on the <strong>Jupay Podcast</strong>, Nimley argued that Ghana is heading into the global tournament without a clear technical identity, without adequate competitive assessment and with what he described as one of the weakest benches among participating nations.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="573" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-1024x573.png" alt="We&#039;re sitting on a time bomb with Otto Addo ahead of World Cup - Coach Nimley" class="wp-image-10032980541" title="We&#039;re sitting on a time bomb with Otto Addo ahead of World Cup - Coach Nimley" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-1024x573.png 1024w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-300x168.png 300w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-768x430.png 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-1536x859.png 1536w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-536x300.png 536w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-233x130.png 233w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-150x84.png 150w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-218x122.png 218w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-758x424.png 758w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-330x185.png 330w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-225x126.png 225w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-217x121.png 217w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-340x190.png 340w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-268x150.png 268w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST-55x31.png 55w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/JUYPAY-PODCAST.png 1825w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>&#8220;For the fact that he has given us no opportunity whatsoever to properly assess our team before going for the World Cup, we are only sitting on a time bomb waiting to explode. The AFCON should have been the yardstick for Ghana to assess the Black Stars ahead of the World Cup,&#8221; Nimley said.</p>



<p>Otto Addo, a former Ghana international, first took charge of the Black Stars on an interim basis in early 2022 after Ghana&#8217;s disappointing Africa Cup of Nations campaign. </p>



<p>He led the team through the crucial two-legged World Cup playoff against Nigeria, guiding Ghana to qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar on the away goals rule.</p>



<p>After the tournament in Qatar, Addo stepped down, citing family reasons and his club commitments in Germany. </p>

<p>However, he was later reappointed by the Ghana Football Association (GFA) to lead a rebuilding effort to restore confidence in the national team after inconsistent performances and early tournament exits in recent years.</p>



<p>His second stint has been defined by attempts to refresh the squad, integrate younger players and rebuild cohesion. Yet results and performances have continued to divide opinion among fans and pundits.</p>



<p>Despite Otto Addo’s qualification record, Nimley insists the current technical direction lacks depth and pedigree.</p>



<p>“I would sack Coach Otto Addo immediately if I had my way. The Black Stars job is so attractive and lucrative that once I open the market for that job, you will see the quality. </p>



<p>&#8220;He himself knew from day one that he wouldn’t be chosen for the job. When the application was opened, he knew he was not qualified for the job and did not apply. He did not apply; he was told to apply for it,” he claimed.</p>



<p>He maintained that he has consistently doubted Addo’s suitability for the position and his ability to lead the Black Stars to the 2026 World Cup.</p>



<iframe width="1234" height="694" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0lNhEmoY3qw" title="Jupay Podcast Live Episode 1: Is The Black Stars Ready For The World Cup?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>Central to Nimley’s argument is his belief that Ghana has lacked a credible, competitive benchmark to test the squad’s readiness for the World Cup.</p>



<p>He described the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) as the ideal platform for evaluating team structure, tactical strength and squad depth ahead of the global tournament. In his view, the absence of a convincing AFCON performance leaves too many unanswered questions.</p>



<p>“I am not convinced that the current team is good enough. I have looked not only at our group in the World Cup, but also compared our technical team to nearly 90 per cent of the teams in the World Cup, and our bench is one of the weakest going into the tournament. There’s no pedigree, no establishment,” Nimley said.</p>



<p>When asked what should be done at this stage, Nimley’s response was blunt.</p>



<p>“Sack him.”</p>



<p>He pointed to historical precedents, recalling how former GFA president Kwesi Nyantakyi dismissed Kwesi Appiah shortly before the 2015 AFCON and appointed Avram Grant &#8211; a move that saw Ghana reach the tournament’s final.</p>



<p>“We saw Kwesi Nyantakyi sack Kwesi Appiah two and a half weeks to AFCON and bring in a quality coach in Avram Grant, and we went all the way to the finals. But for luck, we would have won that AFCON.”</p>



<p>He also cited examples from the continent, referencing coaching changes involving the Algeria and Ivory Coast national teams before or during AFCON tournaments that ultimately ended in title triumphs.</p>



<p>Otto Addo’s tenure has unfolded under significant pressure, with public debate often split between those who credit him for steering Ghana back to the World Cup and those who question the team’s tactical evolution and consistency.</p>



<p>With the World Cup approaching, Nimley’s &#8220;time bomb&#8221; warning adds fresh intensity to ongoing conversations about leadership, preparedness and national expectations.</p>



<p>Whether the Ghana Football Association stands by its man or reconsiders its approach, the scrutiny of Otto Addo and the Black Stars is only set to intensify as the countdown to the World Cup continues.</p>

<p>Borussia Dortmund will take a two-goal lead into the second leg of their Champions League knockout phase play-off tie after a routine home win against Atalanta.</p>



<p>After the game was delayed by 15 minutes because the Bundesliga club encountered traffic problems on the way to the stadium, the hosts took the lead within three minutes through forward Serhou Guirassy.</p>



<p>The Guinea international rose highest to connect with Julian Ryerson&#8217;s cross and head home his 16th goal of the season.</p>



<p>The 1997 winners continued to dominate and doubled their lead in the 42nd minute when Guirassy turned provider and crossed for Maximilian Beier to tap in at the back post.</p>



<p>Despite enjoying a greater share of the ball in the second half, Atalanta were unable to ever really test home keeper Gregor Kobel.</p>



<p>The return leg takes place in Bergamo on Wednesday, 25 February (17:30 GMT)</p>

					<description><![CDATA[England winger Bukayo Saka has signed a new five-year contract with Arsenal until 2031.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>England winger Bukayo Saka has signed a new five-year contract with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/arsenal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arsenal</a> until 2031.</p>



<p>Sources have told BBC Sport that the agreement will make Saka the club&#8217;s best-paid player on wages in excess of £300,000 a week.</p>



<p>Talks over a new deal have been ongoing for nearly a year, with Saka&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy7mxz17gnlo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">verbally agreeing</a>&nbsp;to commit his future to the club in January.</p>



<p>Saka signed his previous deal, which was due to expire in 2027, in 2023 but his renewal means the 24-year-old has committed his peak years to the Gunners.</p>



<p>The news comes as a major boost for the Gunners, as they battle on four fronts to win silverware for the first time since 2020.</p>



<p>The agreement is the latest example of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/arsenal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arsenal</a>&nbsp;tying down their key players to long-term contracts as they look to keep their title-chasing squad together.</p>



<p>William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly all signed new long-term contracts in the summer.</p>



<p>Saka has scored seven goals in 33 appearances for the Gunners this term.</p>



<p>He made his first-team debut as a 17-year-old in 2018 after coming through <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/arsenal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arsenal</a>&#8216;s academy and has since made 217 Premier League appearances, scoring 57 goals.</p>



<p>Saka is 116 Premier League appearances behind Ray Parlour&#8217;s record 333 for the Gunners and will have been a professional at the club for 13 years when his new deal expires in 2031.</p>



<p>Saka has scored 14 goals in 48 appearances for England and is expected to be part of Thomas Tuchel&#8217;s squad for the World Cup, which begins in June.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/arsenal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arsenal</a> are four points clear at the top of the Premier League, and they will face <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/manchester-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manchester City</a> in the EFL Cup final in March.</p>



<p>The Gunners are also through to the knockout stages of the Champions League, as well as the fifth round of the FA Cup.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Analysis-Saka-deal-as-important-as-any-signing-">Analysis: Saka deal as important as any signing</h2>



<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/topics/cp99zjx9mv1t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Howell</a></strong>, Arsenal reporter</p>



<p>The agreement with Saka is more important than the £250m outlay&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/arsenal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arsenal</a>&nbsp;made to bring in eight new players in the summer.</p>



<p>Saka&#8217;s importance on the pitch alongside his bond with supporters and his journey from the academy make his position impossible to replicate.</p>



<p>His new deal will see him stay at the club into the peak years of his career and &#8211; after several seasons with numbers that match elite wingers across the game &#8211;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/arsenal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arsenal</a>&nbsp;will benefit from the progression he could still achieve.</p>



<p>The second half of this season is crucial for Saka as he looks to help&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/arsenal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arsenal</a>&nbsp;lift a major trophy for the first time since the FA Cup in 2020.</p>



<p>Mikel Arteta can rely on him and he is one of the reasons why the majority of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/arsenal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arsenal</a>&#8216;s attacking play goes down the right &#8211; the side Saka plays on.</p>



<p>The winger is also set for an important summer with Thomas Tuchel&#8217;s England at the World Cup.</p>



<p>England fans will hope that after a season of success with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/arsenal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arsenal</a>, he can deliver for his country on the biggest stage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/arsenal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arsenal</a> manager Mikel Arteta says he is &#8220;happy&#8221; to interact with fans, but there are times when he has felt &#8220;exposed&#8221; and &#8220;not very comfortable&#8221;.</p>



<p>A video recorded after the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cn0e377e218t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gunners&#8217; FA Cup win over Wigan</a>&nbsp;on Sunday showed a man repeatedly asking for Arteta&#8217;s autograph as he and his wife waited in traffic outside Emirates Stadium.</p>



<p>Arteta refused to open his window, and several more people crowded around the vehicle. They then stepped back while the man followed the vehicle as it crept forward, saying he wanted Arteta to sign an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/arsenal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arsenal</a> jersey for his son.</p>



<p>&#8220;I always try to be very respectful,&#8221; said Arteta. &#8220;I love to sign and photograph as much as we can. I think it&#8217;s part of our role.</p>



<p>&#8220;But there are certain things in terms of security that we have to respect. Especially when certain people are doing it, they are not doing it for the right reasons.&#8221;</p>



<p>Arteta and his wife were also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/37107558/arsenal-mikel-arteta-fans-car/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">videoed while sat in traffic following a Champions League game in October,,&nbsp;external</a>&nbsp;with his wife described as being &#8220;frustrated&#8221; and &#8220;annoyed&#8221; as someone took a selfie next to the vehicle.</p>



<p>&#8220;The last time my wife was there, what was in the media was totally wrong and unfair,&#8221; Arteta added.</p>



<p>&#8220;I prefer to talk about the incredible other people that come around genuinely, because they want to have that interaction, and I think everybody who knows me, [knows] how happy I am to do that.</p>



<p>&#8220;But there are moments and contexts when that is not the case. And then we need somebody there to protect us as well because, if not, we will get exposed, you cannot move from your car, and you don&#8217;t feel very comfortable there.&#8221;</p>



<p>It is understood that as part of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/arsenal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arsenal</a>&#8216;s security guidance, the manager, players and coaches are advised not to roll their vehicle windows down when driving.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Vinicius Junior scored a brilliant winner for Real Madrid against Benfica in <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">the first leg of their Champions League play-off, which was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cpv843x1zgzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">halted for 10 minutes due to</a></span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cpv843x1zgzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> alleged racist abuse.</a></p>



<p>The Brazil forward put the visitors ahead in the 50th minute with a magnificent curling strike past Anatoliy Trubin at the Estadio da Luz.</p>



<p>Vinicius was then booked for an excessive celebration and, following a heated exchange with Benfica&#8217;s Gianluca Prestianni, he ran over to referee Francois Letexier as he gestured in the direction of the Argentina winger.</p>



<p>Vinicius then walked off the pitch and was followed by his team-mates before play restarted 10 minutes later.</p>



<p>Benfica manager Jose Mourinho was shown two yellow cards in the 85th minute and will be missing from the sideline in next Wednesday&#8217;s return leg at the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>



<p>There were 12 minutes of added time as a result of play being stopped and during that period an object was thrown from the crowd that struck Vinicius on the arm as he prepared to take a corner.</p>



<p>Before Real took the lead, Vinicius shot narrowly wide following Trent Alexander-Arnold&#8217;s defence-splitting pass to Federico Valverde.</p>



<p>Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was then required to keep out Fredrik Aursnes&#8217; stinging drive as both sides chased an opener.</p>



<p>Kylian Mbappe was inches away from meeting a ball from Alexander-Arnold &#8211; who played the full match &#8211; into the penalty area as Real pressed before half-time.</p>



<p>Mbappe blazed over after being teed up by Vinicius&#8217; back heel and was then denied by Trubin, who was again called upon to deny Arda Guler as Benfica hung on until the break.</p>



<p>Benfica rarely threatened Courtois&#8217; goal after Vinicius&#8217; majestic strike as Real put the seal on a masterful away performance that was overshadowed by the allegations of racism that followed the winning goal.</p>



<p>The sides were playing in Lisbon just 19 days after the astonishing conclusion to their game at the end of the league phase, when goalkeeper Trubin scored an 89th-minute header to clinch the final play-off spot for Benfica on goal difference.</p>



<p>Benfica will seek to overturn the deficit when the return leg takes place in Madrid on Wednesday, 25 February (20:00 GMT).</p>

<p>Carlos Alcaraz says he was glad to get through some &#8220;difficult moments&#8221; against Arthur Rinderknech as he won his first match since triumphing at last month&#8217;s Australian Open.</p>



<p>Top seed Alcaraz had to save two set points in the second set but won 6-4 7-6 (7-5) against the unseeded Frenchman in the first round of the Qatar Open in Doha.</p>



<p>It was seven-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz&#8217;s first match since beating Novak Djokovic in Melbourne to become the youngest player to achieve the career Grand Slam.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was really difficult,&#8221; said the Spaniard.</p>



<p>&#8220;Arthur is a really dangerous player. Nobody wants to play against him in the first round, I&#8217;m happy with the level. I&#8217;m happy that I got through difficult moments in the match.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alcaraz, 22, started well and broke to go 3-2 up, before comfortably seeing out the rest of the set to take it 6-4 with a deft volley at the net.</p>



<p>World number 30 Rinderknech improved from there, earning two set points at 6-5, but Alcaraz, helped by his 28 winners in the match, saved them before coming out on top in the tie-break.</p>



<p>He sealed victory with a forehand down the line and sets up a second-round tie against France&#8217;s Valentin Royer, who beat countryman Pierre-Hugues Herbert 6-0 6-3.</p>



<p>Victory was Alcaraz&#8217;s 150th at tour level on hard courts and extended his flawless start to the 2026 season to 8-0.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Dubai-Championships-sees-more-withdrawals">Dubai Championships sees more withdrawals</h2>



<p>The second round of the Dubai Tennis Championships was hit by fitness issues again as four players, including fifth seed Mirra Andreeva, advanced because of player withdrawals.</p>



<p>Andreeva went through when opponent Daria Kasatkina pulled out before the tie, while ninth seed Belinda Bencic was also handed a walkover when Sara Bejlek withdrew prior to the match.</p>



<p>Paula Badosa retired after losing the first set 6-4 against sixth seed Elina Svitolina, while Ella Seidel withdrew after dropping the first set 6-0 to Jaqueline Cristian.</p>



<p>The withdrawals follow nine dropouts in the first round, which saw seven lucky losers from qualifying fill the main draw.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Women&#8217;s Tennis Association (WTA) has announced it is launching &#8220;the Tour Architecture Council&#8221; to oversee improvements to the women&#8217;s game.</p>



<p>In a statement, WTA chair Valerie Camillo says the council has been set up because the &#8220;current calendar does not feel sustainable for players given the physical, professional and personal pressures of competing at the highest level&#8221;.</p>



<p>Chaired by American world number five Jessica Pegula, the council is set to &#8220;develop meaningful improvements to the calendar, commitments and other core elements of the Tour framework&#8221;.</p>



<p>Potential changes to the Tour &#8220;can be implemented as soon as the 2027 season&#8221;.</p>



<p>The council is made up of a number of players, including former world number one Victoria Azarenka, as well as tournament directors and WTA Tour chiefs.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a chance to focus on specific parts of the Tour structure and see what can be addressed in the short-term, while continuing the conversation on longer-term improvements in a dedicated, focused way,&#8221; said Pegula.</p>



<p>&#8220;The WTA has the opportunity and standing to bring a group like this together and I&#8217;m grateful they&#8217;re using that power to advance real change for 2027.&#8221;</p>

<p>Galatasaray will take a three-goal lead to Turin after coming from behind to beat Juventus in a frenetic first leg of their Champions League knockout phase play-off tie.</p>



<p>The hosts trailed 2-1 at half-time but produced a superb fightback to lead 3-2 by the hour mark through goals from Noa Lang and Davinson Sanchez.</p>



<p>That came after Juventus had launched an excellent response of their own to complete a 17-minute first-half turnaround, through Teun Koopmeiners&#8217; double, after going behind to Gabriel Sara&#8217;s opener.</p>



<p>However, the second half went from bad to worse for the Serie A side.</p>



<p>Half-time substitute Juan Cabal received a second yellow card just 21 minutes after his introduction to leave Juventus a goal and a man down.</p>



<p>The Turkish champions were relentless in attempting to make their man advantage count.</p>



<p>Lang punished lax Juventus defending for his second on the night, before Sacha Boey added a late fifth to put Okan Buruk&#8217;s side in firm control of the tie.</p>



<p>The return leg takes place in Turin on Wednesday, 25th February (20:00 GMT).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Substitute Desire Doue inspired holders Paris St-Germain to an impressive comeback against 10-man Monaco in the first leg of their Champions League knockout phase play-off tie.</p>



<p>The Frenchman was named on the bench at the Stade Louis II by manager Luis Enrique but was introduced in place of Ousmane Dembele midway through the first half with PSG two goals down.</p>



<p>The 20-year-old forward scored twice and had a hand in Achraf Hakimi&#8217;s equaliser as PSG claimed an important victory in the first European meeting between the two French clubs.</p>



<p>The hosts &#8211; who inflicted defeat on Luis Enrique&#8217;s side at the same venue in a Ligue 1 fixture back in November &#8211; took the lead inside the first minute when Folarin Balogun connected with Aleksandr Golovin&#8217;s cross to head home from close range.</p>



<p>The lowest scorers among the 24 teams remaining in the competition deepened PSG&#8217;s problems in the 18th minute as Balogun raced through on goal and slotted past Matvey Safonov for his 10th goal of the season.</p>



<p>PSG were offered a lifeline from the penalty spot four minutes later when Wout Faes bundled Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to the ground inside the area.</p>



<p>But after missing a spot-kick against Newcastle United in the final league-phase match last month, Vitinha was denied again as Phillip Kohn sprang down to his right to save the midfielder&#8217;s effort.</p>



<p>PSG pulled one back in the 29th minute as Doue, introduced two minutes earlier for Ballon d&#8217;Or winner Dembele, drilled his shot in off the post from an acute angle.</p>



<p>The Frenchman had a hand in the equaliser four minutes before the break as his effort from outside the area was palmed into the path of Hakimi, who finished with a half-volley to score his first Champions League goal of the season.</p>



<p>Monaco&#8217;s Golovin was sent off for the second time in four days seconds after the break for a reckless challenge on Vitinha.</p>



<p>The Russian forward was originally shown a yellow card, but that was upgraded after the referee reviewed the challenge on the pitchside monitor.</p>



<p>The visitors took advantage of the extra man and completed the turnaround in the 67th minute when Warren Zaire-Emery teed up Doue to strike past Kohn and become the first PSG substitute to score two or more goals in a Champions League match since October 2019.</p>



<p>The return leg takes place in Paris on Wednesday, 25th February (20:00 GMT).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The match was halted for 10 minutes after Vinicius reported alleged racist abuse by Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni to referee Francois Letexier, and he and his team-mates temporarily left the field.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trent Alexander-Arnold said the alleged racist abuse of team-mate Vinicius Junior during Real Madrid&#8217;s Champions League match at Benfica was a &#8220;disgrace to football&#8221;, while opposition manager Jose Mourinho was criticised for his comments on the incident.</p>



<p>The match was halted for 10 minutes after&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cpv843x1zgzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vinicius reported alleged racist abuse by Benfica&#8217;s Gianluca Prestianni</a>&nbsp;to referee Francois Letexier, and he and his team-mates temporarily left the field.</p>



<p>The Brazil forward, who has been the victim of numerous incidents of racist abuse during his playing career, said &#8220;racists are, above all, cowards&#8221; in a post on Instagram.</p>



<p>Benfica manager Mourinho claimed Vinicius did not &#8220;celebrate in a respectful way&#8221; after his stunning goal in the 1-0 win shortly before the incident at the Estadio da Luz.</p>



<p>The former Real Madrid and Chelsea boss said: &#8220;There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium.</p>



<p>&#8220;A stadium where Vinicius plays something happens, always.&#8221;</p>



<p>Reacting to Mourinho&#8217;s comments, former Real Madrid midfielder Clarence Seedorf said on Amazon Prime: &#8220;I think he is still emotional. I think he made a big mistake today to justify racial abuse.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s saying it&#8217;s OK, when Vinicius provokes you, to be racist &#8211; and I think that is very wrong.</p>



<p>&#8220;We should never, ever justify racial abuse. Vinicius has had enough of that unjustified behaviour from people. I know Mourinho by heart would agree with me but he expressed himself a bit unfortunately, I believe.&#8221;</p>



<p>England international Alexander-Arnold condemned the abuse in his post-match interview.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think what has happened tonight is a disgrace to football and overshadowed the performance, as well as an amazing goal,&#8221; said Alexander-Arnold.</p>



<p>&#8220;Vini has been subject to this a few times throughout his career. To ruin a night like this for our team is a disgrace.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is no place for it in football or society. It is disgusting.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What-did-Mourinho-say">What did Mourinho say?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/8d43/live/e3efbfd0-0c60-11f1-a0df-a5df7a949202.jpg" alt="Real Madrid&#039;s Vinicius Junior speaks with Benfica manager Jose Mourinho" title="Mourinho&#039;s &#039;big mistake&#039; after &#039;disgusting&#039; Vinicius incident"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Vinicius&#8217; goal gave Real Madrid a 1-0 victory in the first leg of their Champions League knockout phase play-off tie</figcaption></figure>



<p>Mourinho was seen speaking with Vinicius after the 25-year-old took the decision to walk off the pitch following the interaction with Prestianni.</p>



<p>The Portuguese said in his post-match interview that he had been told different things by Vinicius and Prestianni about the incident.</p>



<p>In addition to expressing his belief that Vinicius had been disrespectful with his celebration, he pointed to the club&#8217;s legendary striker Eusebio as proof that Benfica is not a racist club.</p>



<p>Asked if he felt Vinicius incited the crowd, Mourinho said: &#8220;Yes. I believe so.</p>



<p>&#8220;It should be the crazy moment of the game, an amazing goal. Unfortunately, he was not just happy to score that astonishing goal. When you score a goal like that, you celebrate in a respectful way.&#8221;</p>



<p>He added, &#8220;I told [Vinicius], when you score a goal like that, you just celebrate and walk back. When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person in the history of this club [Eusebio] was black.</p>



<p>&#8220;This club, the last thing that it is, is racist. If in his mind there was something in relation to that, this is Benfica.</p>



<p>&#8220;They [Vinicius and Prestianni] told me different things. But I don&#8217;t believe in one or another. I want to be an independent.&#8221;</p>



<p>Speaking after watching Mourinho&#8217;s interview, former England international Theo Walcott said on Amazon Prime: &#8220;I am quite calm and composed and I am not someone who gets angry often.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love everything Jose Mourinho has done in football but I think he has made a poor decision in that sense. It was maybe the one time we shouldn&#8217;t have heard from him, the one night he should not have been in front of the cameras.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What-happens-next">What happens next?</h2>



<p>Vinicius&#8217; Real Madrid team-mate Kylian Mbappe called for Argentina winger Prestianni to no longer be allowed to play in the Champions League following the alleged incident.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing like this has ever happened to me, and in these kinds of important matters, it&#8217;s important to speak very clearly and not to speak in generalities,&#8221; France forward Mbappe said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have the utmost respect for Benfica and their coach, who is one of the best in history and who made history with Real Madrid. But, in my opinion, this player doesn&#8217;t deserve to play in the Champions League anymore.</p>



<p>&#8220;We cannot accept that a player who plays in Europe&#8217;s top competition behaves like this. This guy doesn&#8217;t deserve to play in the Champions League anymore, but we&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s leave it to Uefa, who always try to do something. Now they have a serious case, and I hope they do something.&#8221;</p>



<p>Prestianni has yet to comment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2048/cpsprodpb/d846/live/4f0bf220-0c61-11f1-a0df-a5df7a949202.jpg" alt="Gianluca Prestianni speaks to Vinicius Junior while covering his face with his shirt" title="Mourinho&#039;s &#039;big mistake&#039; after &#039;disgusting&#039; Vinicius incident"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Vinicius alerted referee Francois Letexier to alleged racist abuse by Gianluca Prestianni early in the second half</figcaption></figure>



<p>With the two clubs set to meet for the second leg in Madrid next Wednesday, Walcott called for urgent action by Uefa.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something that cannot be done in months and months, it needs to be dealt with immediately,&#8221; Walcott said.</p>



<p>Former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, speaking on CBS, reflected on his own experiences of racist abuse during his playing career.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can relate to what Vinicius Junior is going through. That happened to me so many times on the field. At times you feel lonely because it&#8217;s going to be your word against his word, because we don&#8217;t know what he has said,&#8221; Henry said.</p>



<p>&#8220;He put his shirt over his mouth. Clearly, already, he looks suspicious because he didn&#8217;t want people to see what he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see how big of a man Prestianni is – tell us what you said.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The leadership of the Sports Writers Association of Ghana (SWAG) has paid a courtesy call on the Minister for Sports and Recreation (MoSR), Kofi Adams, to deepen strategic collaboration and rally stronger institutional support for the growth of the sector.</p>



<p>The delegation, led by the SWAG president, Kwabena Yeboah, marked the first official engagement between the Association and the Minister since his assumption of office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr. Yeboah, in his address, commended the minister for his open-door policy that has allowed stakeholders to contribute meaningfully to the sports ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;We have been extremely&nbsp;impressed with your relationship&nbsp;with sports journalists&nbsp;in this country. Even before you were formally appointed, you came to our office, which is unprecedented, and we are most humbled,&#8221; he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He further praised the ministry&#8217;s support that facilitated Ghana’s active participation at the recent AIPS congress in Gambia, making positive headlines across African and global platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SWAG president&nbsp;emphasised that such international exposure underscores the importance of sports as an economic enabler for Africa.</p>



<p>The renowned sports journalist appealed for increased publicity and support to ensure the fund’s growth, stressing the critical need for grassroots sports development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr. Kofi Iddie Adams, Minister&nbsp;of Sports and Recreation, also expressed appreciation for SWAG’s role as a powerful voice in the sports sector, emphasising the importance of constructive criticism and productive journalism in shaping the sector’s future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The minister committed to collaborating with the association to develop training modules aimed at enhancing the capacity of sports journalists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;Member of Parliament for the Buem Constituency again urged more publicity to attract investors and foster local talent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other members of the delegation included Vice President Evelyn Nsiah Asare, General Secretary Charles Osei Asibey, Deputy General Secretary Kenneth Odeng Adade, and Treasurer Owuraku Nsiah, alongside other key officials of the Association.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Swiss sportswear brand On is proud to announce the signing of 18-year-old Kenyan athletics sensation Mercy Chepngeno to a NIL deal. The partnership marks a significant milestone for Chepngeno, a Form 3 student at Chagaik Secondary School in Kenya, as she joins the ranks of elite global student-athletes representing the brand.</p>



<p>Born in the village of Lesirwo, Kericho County, Kenya, Chepngeno captured the hearts of the running world in 2024 when photos of her competing barefoot at the KSSSA Regional Levels in Kapsabet went viral. Since then, she has dominated the junior ranks, recently securing Gold in both the 3,000m steeplechase and 1,500m at the 2026 Track and Field Open in Thika, Kenya, and Silver at the Africa U-20 Championships in Nigeria last year.</p>



<p>Under the guidance of her Coach, Rono, Chepngeno has utilized the high-altitude tea estate paths of Kericho to sharpen her skills, establishing a recent trajectory that confirms her status as a future powerhouse. In 2025, she became a Double National Champion in the 1,500m and 2,000m at the KSSSA Games, followed by a Gold Medal performance at the Betika Weekend Meet in Machakos that October. </p>

<p>Her momentum continued onto the continental stage in December 2025, where she secured a Silver Medal in the 3,000m Steeplechase at the Africa U-20 Championships in Nigeria. Most recently, in January 2026, she solidified her dominance by becoming a Double Gold Medalist in the 1,500m and 3,000m Steeplechase at the Thika Weekend Meet.</p>



<p>“At On, we believe that the future of athletics is built by supporting athletes like Mercy who balance immense talent with an incredible work ethic,” said Libby Davidson, NIL Athlete Manager at On. </p>



<p>“Mercy’s double win in Thika and her Silver at the Africa U-20 Championships prove she is a star in the making. We are proud to provide the gear and support she needs to pursue her dreams on the track and her ambitions to become a doctor.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President of the Ghana Football Association (GFA), Kurt Okraku, says he was not surprised by the Black Stars&#8217; performance at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).</p>



<p>According to him, he was not expecting the Black Stars to perform differently from what they did when they took to the competition in Cote d&#8217;Ivoire. </p>



<p>Ghana was knocked out in the group stage of the continental tournament for the second consecutive time after managing just two points from three games. </p>



<p>&#8220;We qualified for the AFCON in Cote d&#8217;Ivoire, and it was a disaster; it didn&#8217;t go well, and I was very livid about the turnout of the events because I saw everything right unfold in my eyes,&#8221; he said on Asaase Radio.</p>



<p>&#8220;To be honest with you, going into that competition, I was not expecting anything different&#8230;for those of my guys who were close to me, I was very clear to them in private that it won&#8217;t work. I knew the team and I knew about the happenings in the team.</p>



<p>&#8220;We exited the competition, and once we came home, there was a need to re-examine what we did, and instead of us going up, we started to decline, and we didn&#8217;t make it to the last AFCON.&#8221;</p>



<p>Having missed out on qualification for AFCON 2025, the Black Stars managed to secure a spot at the 2026 FIFA World Cup to be staged in Mexico, USA and Canada.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Former Asante Kotoko management member, Alhaji Ali Maradona, says Hearts of Oak goalkeeper Benjamin Asare is “not at the level” to start for the Black Stars at the 2026 FIFA World Cup.</p>



<p>Asare, who has established himself as Ghana’s number one in recent months, starred in the Phobians’ Super Clash against Asante Kotoko at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium, helping them to a 1-0 victory.</p>



<p>He has now kept nine clean sheets and conceded four goals in 12 Ghana Premier League appearances.</p>



<p>However, Alhaji Ali insists the domestic competition cannot be compared to the global showpiece.</p>



<p>“People praise the Hearts of Oak goalkeeper [Benjamin Asare] but let’s be honest, he is not at the level of the Black Stars,” he said in an interview with Asempa FM.</p>



<p>“The World Cup isn’t a concert. You need an experienced goalkeeper.</p>



<p>“He deserved the [Man of the Match award against Kotoko] but that is not the World Cup. I am not saying he should not go to the World Cup, but to be number one, Ghana needs an experienced goalkeeper.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Ghana will face Austria on March 27 before locking horns with Germany three days later in international friendlies.</p>



<p>The Black Stars will open their World Cup campaign against Panama on Wednesday, June 17, before facing England and Croatia on June 23 and 27 respectively.</p>



<p>Otto Addo is expected to submit his squad for the tournament by June 1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President of the Ghana Football Association (GFA), Kurt Okraku, says his target is to the Black Stars win the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). </p>



<p>The Black Stars have struggled in their bid to win the continental tournament in recent times under the administration of Okraku. </p>



<p>Ghana failed to make it out of the group stage in the 2021 and 2023 editions of the tournament, while they also failed to qualify for the 2025 tournament, which was played in Morocco, after a disappointing qualifying campaign. </p>



<p>Despite the setbacks, Okraku is committed to ensuring the senior national team wins the coveted prize one day.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to win the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), and that is the fact. Only God knows the number of times we have tried, and we have not been able to win the AFCON title,&#8221; he told Asaase Radio.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have not won with the Black Stars, but for the U-20, they won the AFCON, and Black Queens won bronze at the WAFCON, and they are back again to compete at the WAFCON next month.&#8221;</p>



<p>Okraku also highlighted the recent performances of the national teams while also reaffirming his ambition to chalk up success at all levels.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Black Starlets, after a number of years, are back at the AFCON and the Black Princesses just qualified for the last round of the U-20 Women’s World Cup qualifiers, and hopefully they will be at the World Cup. They have been there two times under my leadership,&#8221; he continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;Basically, I want to win every tournament for Ghana, and I want to place Ghana on the medal podium on any given occasion.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ghana&#8217;s last AFCON success came in 1982, after which they have played in three finals in 1992, 2010 and 2015 but failed to win any. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Referee Chris Kavanagh and his assistant Nick Greenhalgh have not been selected for a Premier League game this weekend.</p>



<p>The pair were heavily criticised for their decisions in the <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">fourth-round FA Cup tie between <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cx28kq7341wt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aston Villa and Newcastle United</a> on Saturday, which featured</span> no video assistant referee.</p>



<p>VAR will not be brought in until the fifth round.</p>



<p>Referees&#8217; body Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO) bases its selections on factors including post-match performance assessments conducted by an independent Key Match Incidents panel, ensuring accountability for officials.</p>



<p>Among the errors, Kavanagh and Greenhalgh missed a clear offside against Tammy Abraham for Villa&#8217;s opening goal.</p>



<p>A potential red card for Lucas Digne for a challenge on Jacob Murphy was also missed, along with a possible offside against Dan Burn on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/newcastle-united" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newcastle</a>&#8216;s equaliser.</p>



<p>But it was the Digne non-penalty decision that really left most speechless.</p>



<p>The Villa full-back was two yards inside the penalty area when he was penalised for a handball, but Kavanagh and Greenhalgh decided the offence was a yard outside the area and awarded a free-kick &#8211; from which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/newcastle-united" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newcastle</a>&#8216;s Sandro Tonali scored the 63rd-minute equaliser.</p>



<p>Speaking on Match of the Day, Wayne Rooney said it was &#8220;one of the worst decisions I have ever seen&#8221;.</p>



<p>However, despite the criticism, Kavanagh is highly regarded and in December was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c5ydy1v2x2wo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promoted to Uefa&#8217;s elite list</a> of referees to join Michael Oliver and Anthony Taylor.</p>



<p>The other assistant at Villa Park, Gary Beswick, has been appointed to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/nottingham-forest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nottingham Forest</a> versus <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/teams/liverpool" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liverpool</a> on Sunday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Benfica manager Jose Mourinho says Real Madrid will be &#8220;wounded and dangerous&#8221; after their dramatic defeat against his side in the Champions League last month, as the sides prepare to meet again in the competition.</p>



<p>Benfica sealed their spot in the play-offs with an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/c62rdzw6lzrt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incredible 4-2 victory</a> against Madrid in the final match of the league phase, with goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin scoring a 98th-minute header.</p>



<p>The defeat in Lisbon dropped the Spanish club, who have won the Champions League 15 times, from third to ninth and out of the automatic qualification spots.</p>



<p>&#8220;They are wounded. And a wounded king is dangerous,&#8221; said former Madrid coach Mourinho.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will play the first leg with our heads, ambition and confidence. We know what we did to the kings of the Champions League.&#8221;</p>



<p>Benfica, who are third in Portugal&#8217;s Primeira Liga, host the first leg of the tie at the Estadio da Luz on Tuesday at 20:00 GMT.</p>



<p>The Portuguese side looked to be heading out of the competition on goals scored, despite leading Madrid 3-2 with seconds remaining.</p>



<p>But Benfica were awarded a free-kick against nine-man Real, who had Raul Asencio and Rodrygo sent off in added time, and Ukraine goalkeeper Trubin headed past opposite number Thibaut Courtois.</p>



<p>Mourinho said the tie will be &#8220;very demanding, without a doubt&#8221;.</p>



<p>He added: &#8220;Trubin won&#8217;t be in the attack at the Luz stadium. I&#8217;m very used to these kinds of ties.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing it all my life. People often think you need a certain result in the first leg for this or that reason. I say there is no definitive result.&#8221;</p>



<p>The victory last month was Mourinho&#8217;s first over his former club and meant Benfica reached the knockout stages despite losing their first four games in the league phase.</p>



<p>Real, meanwhile, are top of the La Liga table, two points clear of rivals Barcelona in second place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Premier League and English Football League will resume their procedures for Ramadan, with matches pausing briefly to allow Muslim players to break their fast.</p>



<p>Ramadan starts this week and will last for a month. During this time, Muslims abstain from food and drink from dawn until sunset.</p>



<p>With sunset in the UK ranging from about 17:00 to 19:00 GMT during this period, the only games that could see a break in play will be Saturday&#8217;s 17:30 kick-off and Sunday&#8217;s 16:30 kick-off.</p>



<p>As has been the case in previous years, club captains alongside match officials will find a natural pause in the game to allow Muslim players or match officials to break their fast.</p>



<p>Teams and match officials will discuss beforehand whether a pause is required and an approximate time for the stoppage will be agreed. The break will not be used as a team drinks break nor as a tactical time-out.</p>



<p>Play will not stop while matches are in mid-flow but at the earliest convenient moment during a goal-kick, free-kick or throw-in.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1008/cpsprodpb/666a/live/c303bfc0-0b2e-11f1-a204-b3f033b84443.jpg" alt="Everton players break their fast" title="Ramadan breaks to be used across English football again"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Everton players break their fast during a Premier League match against Newcastle in 2024</figcaption></figure>



<p>In 2021, an agreement was put in place to allow Muslim players to break their fast during a Premier League match.</p>



<p>This first break took place in a game between Leicester City and Crystal Palace in April 2021. The match was paused at a goal-kick around the half-hour mark to allow&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Wesley_Fofana3/status/1386811866836611078?s=20">Leicester&#8217;s Wesley Fofana and Palace&#8217;s Cheikhou Kouyate,&nbsp;external</a>&nbsp;to replenish themselves with liquids and energy gels.</p>



<p>One of the five pillars of Islam is that during Ramadan, Muslims fast during daylight hours to show their devotion to their religion.</p>



<p>Muslim names in the Premier League include Mohamed Salah, William Saliba, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Amad Diallo among others.</p>



<p>&#8220;In the Premier League you are free to do whatever suits you. They will never do anything against your faith and this is great,&#8221;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64966647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former Everton player Abdoulaye Doucoure told BBC Sport in 2023</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;I fast every day, I don&#8217;t miss any day. It has become normal and very easy for me. Training is still the same during Ramadan but when we go [for away matches], we might need to eat later than the others so the chef prepares food for us, making sure everything is in place as at home. We get halal food so there are no problems,&#8221; Doucoure added.</p>



<p>And in 2022, former Liverpool player Sadio Mane revealed the club altered their training schedules to support their Muslim players during the month of Ramadan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Coco Gauff says it is &#8220;tough to wake up&#8221; and see what is happening back home in the United States, and she will continue to speak out about issues that matter to her.</p>



<p>The two-time Grand Slam singles champion is among a host of American athletes who have voiced their displeasure with US President Donald Trump&#8217;s immigration crackdown.</p>



<p>Protests have taken place across the United States since&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jvnl4j1n4o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renee Good</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr571qg4m61o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Pretti</a>&nbsp;were killed in Minneapolis last month by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.</p>



<p>Gauff, 21, spends most of the year competing overseas and the world number five learned of their deaths while in Australia for the first Grand Slam of the year.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think people should be dying in the streets just for existing,&#8221; Gauff told reporters in Dubai, where she is set to compete this week.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is tough to wake up and see something because I do care a lot about our country. I think people think I don&#8217;t for some reason, but I do. I&#8217;m very proud to be American.</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to represent the entire values of what&#8217;s going on in the leadership. I think there&#8217;s a lot of people around that believe in the things I believe in, believe in diversity and equality.&#8221;</p>



<p>When asked about issues in the US during the Australian Open, Gauff called for &#8220;more peace and kindness&#8221; in America.</p>



<p>Compatriot Madison Keys championed immigrants and the diversity they have brought to the US, saying she hopes the country &#8220;can come together&#8221;.</p>



<p>Team GB skier Gus Kenworthy, who grew up in America,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/clyzw5vp07ko" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said he has received death threats</a>&nbsp;after posting an anti-ICE message on social media.</p>



<p>Speaking at the Winter Olympics, freestyle skier Hunter Hess added that &#8220;just because I&#8217;m wearing the flag doesn&#8217;t mean I represent everything that&#8217;s going on in the US&#8221;, and President Trump responded by calling him a &#8220;real loser&#8221;.</p>



<p>Bea Kim said the US is &#8220;very divided&#8221; but &#8220;diversity is what makes us a very strong country&#8221;, while fellow snowboarder Maddie Mastro said she is &#8220;saddened with what&#8217;s happening at home. I feel like we can&#8217;t turn a blind eye to that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Chloe Kim, a silver medalist in Milan-Cortina, feels that athletes should be &#8220;allowed to voice our opinions on what&#8217;s going on. And I think that we need to lead with love and compassion.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gauff says she feels confident giving honest answers when asked about politics, partly because of her maternal grandmother.</p>



<p>Yvonne Lee Odom helped desegregate public schools in the 1960s, becoming the first black student to attend public school in Delray Beach, Florida.</p>



<p>&#8220;My grandma is literally an activist,&#8221; Gauff added. &#8220;This is literally my life. I&#8217;m OK answering tough questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>World number two Jannik Sinner enjoyed a comfortable victory in his first match since losing to Novak Djokovic in the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/clyn9l0zvnpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Open semi-finals.</a></p>



<p>The Italian claimed a straight-set win over the Czech Republic&#8217;s Tomas Machac at the Qatar Open in Doha on Monday.</p>



<p>Sinner won 6-1 6-4 &#8211; wrapping up the first set in 27 minutes &#8211; and was then interviewed by former England footballer Rio Ferdinand.</p>



<p>Sinner will face Australia&#8217;s Alexei Popyrin in the last 16, with the world number 53 having beaten local wild card Mubarak Shannan Zayid 6-0 6-2.</p>



<p>World number 11 Daniil Medvedev claimed a straight-set win as well, beating China&#8217;s Juncheng Shang 6-4 6-2.</p>



<p>Sixth seed Jakub Mensik is also through to the last 16, having come from behind to beat Great Britain&#8217;s Jan Choinski.</p>



<p>After losing a first-set tie-break to the world number 124, the Czech number one recovered to win 6-7 (6-8) 6-2 6-4.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old winger, known for his blistering pace and direct attacking play, has risen steadily through Everton’s youth ranks over the past two seasons, consistently troubling opposition defences with his flair and composure in the final third.</p>



<p>Boakye-Yiadom’s journey in Europe began with a stint at AC Milan, having moved from Ghanaian second-tier side MSK Zilina Africa. </p>



<p>Since then, he has continued to adapt to the demands of elite youth football.</p>



<p>His latest strike takes his goal contributions for Everton’s U21 side to two, having earlier registered an assist.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Lamine Yamal missed a penalty as Barcelona spurned the chance to return to the top of La Liga, falling to defeat in a fiery Catalan derby against Girona.</p>



<p>Hansi Flick&#8217;s side now trails arch rivals Real Madrid by two points in the title race after substitute Fran Beltran struck in the 86th minute at Estadio Montilivi to snatch all three points and ease relegation fears for the home side.</p>



<p>The visitors thought defender Jules Kounde had been fouled in the build-up to the winner, but after a brief video assistant referee (VAR) check the goal was given.</p>



<p>The hosts were reduced to 10 men midway through stoppage time, with substitute Joel Roca bringing down Lamine Yamal with a lunging challenge.</p>



<p>Yet Barcelona were unable to force an equaliser as they succumbed to just a third league defeat against their regional rivals.</p>



<p>The result marks a second loss in succession for Barcelona, who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/cr5lnnev808t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered a 4-0 hammering by Atletico Madrid</a>&nbsp;in the first leg of their Copa del Rey semi-final on Thursday.</p>



<p>It was a fiercely fought contest from the off as the hosts took the game to the league leaders, forcing keeper Joan Garcia into a save inside the first minute.</p>



<p>By contrast, Barcelona were lethargic, spurning several gilt-edged chances to take the lead. Lamine Yamal was the main culprit, twice missing from close range before crashing a penalty off the base of the upright in first-half stoppage time.</p>



<p>In the end, two defenders combined to break the deadlock on 59 minutes. Centre-back Pau Cubarsi looped a header into the top corner from right-back Kounde&#8217;s cross for his first league goal in Barcelona colours.</p>



<p>The visitors&#8217; joy was short-lived, though, as Girona hit back two minutes later when midfielder Thomas Lemar tapped home Vladyslav Vanat&#8217;s centre for his second goal in as many games.</p>



<p>The hosts scored again 10 minutes later as Garcia failed to claim Viktor Tsygankov&#8217;s speculative header, though the goalkeeper was awarded a foul for a shove from Roca on the goalline.</p>



<p>The victory ends a three-game winless run for Girona, who move up to 12th, five points clear of the relegation zone.</p>



<p>Barcelona&#8217;s league winning run ends at three games, and they face a possible five-point gap at the summit come their next fixture &#8211; Real Madrid head to Osasuna on Saturday (17:30 GMT), before Barca host Levante on Sunday (15:15).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the coming days, Sir Jim Ratcliffe should discover if the Football Association&#8217;s legal team has decided that the Manchester United co-owner brought the game into disrepute with his comments on immigration last week, which sparked condemnation from the government and beyond.</p>



<p>The governing body could decide that his remarks met the threshold for him to be charged with a breach of its rules, write to the billionaire to remind him of his responsibilities, or take no action at all.</p>



<p>But whatever the FA does, the impact of his claim that the UK had been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckglv1n4dzeo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;colonised by immigrants&#8221;</a>&nbsp;&#8211; while citing incorrect population data &#8211; could be felt for some time to come.</p>



<p>Regardless of the fact Ratcliffe also received support in some quarters for raising the issue of immigration in his interview with Sky News, the fact United felt the need to issue&nbsp;<a href="https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/man-utd-official-club-statement-12-february-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement,&nbsp;external</a>&nbsp;that read like a public rebuke towards their own co-owner was a sign of the dismay felt at Old Trafford &#8211; along with concern at the potential cost of the backlash his words provoked.</p>



<p>The pointed assertion of United&#8217;s &#8220;inclusive and welcoming&#8221; values &#8211; while not directly naming Ratcliffe &#8211; was a deliberate attempt to distance the club from him, and according to Old Trafford sources was signed off at the highest level.</p>



<p>Hours earlier <a href="https://www.ineos.com/news/ineos-group/statement-from-sir-jim-ratcliffe-in-response-to-uk-press-coverage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ratcliffe had said,</a> he was &#8220;sorry that my choice of language has offended some people in the UK and Europe and caused concern but it is important to raise the issue of controlled and well-managed immigration that supports economic growth&#8221;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Glazers-will-be-horrified-by-Ratcliffe-remarks">&#8216;Glazers will be horrified by Ratcliffe remarks&#8217;</h2>



<p>Ratcliffe has consistently spoken highly of the Glazer family, calling them &#8220;the nicest people on the planet&#8221; last year.</p>



<p>But according to a source familiar with them, the club&#8217;s majority shareholders will have been &#8220;horrified&#8221; by his initial remarks, and will have seen them as showing &#8220;disregard for their ownership&#8221;.</p>



<p>The Glazers &#8211; whose grandparents were Lithuanian Jewish immigrants to the US &#8211; are yet to comment on the episode.</p>



<p>But the source believes a key reason they have supported inclusive initiatives such as All Red All Equal at the club is because they see it as a brand to be nurtured and heavily commercialised, and they will have taken a dim view of remarks that could make sponsors reconsider partnering with United.</p>



<p>&#8220;Big multi-nationals want to associate with youth, positivity and forward-thinking. United is currently struggling for sponsors… and this exacerbates that,&#8221; the source added, suggesting that some potential partners would &#8220;run a mile&#8221;.</p>



<p>This came just days after the Glazers reportedly voiced concerns about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/7015588/2026/02/05/manchester-united-commercial-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United&#8217;s commercial performance</a> at a recent meeting.</p>



<p>It is easy to see why. United have been without a training kit partner since last season, and their shirt-sleeve sponsor is also set to expire in the summer.</p>



<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Last year, Marriott International &#8211; the world&#8217;s largest hotel company &#8211; decided <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/manchester-united-suffer-financial-blow-31848330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not to extend its sponsorship agreement</a> with United after its contract expired.</span></p>



<p>The club&#8217;s deal with Adidas is also worth £10m less this year because United have failed to qualify for the Champions League for two consecutive seasons.</p>



<p>While United still posted a record commercial revenue of £333m last year, their main Premier League rivals have been catching up in recent years.</p>



<p>So, even with the club&#8217;s statement and Ratcliffe&#8217;s qualified apology, it is easy to see why there may be some nervousness among club executives in the wake of the controversy.</p>



<p>Perhaps even more will now hinge on whether the team can secure Champions League qualification for next season.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Potential-impact-on-stadium-project">Potential impact on stadium project</h2>



<p>What this means for the long-term relationship between the six Glazer siblings &#8211; who retain 70% of the club &#8211; and their British business partner is unclear.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that under the terms of the agreement under which Ratcliffe invested £1.25bn in the club in 2024, if the Glazers receive an offer from a third party they want to accept, they can compel him to sell his stake.</p>



<p>And then there are the club&#8217;s hopes for a new 100,000-seat stadium as part of a 370-acre Trafford regeneration project, which relies on the support of local and national politicians.</p>



<p>In January, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and Trafford council leader Tom Ross both hailed a new development corporation designed to deliver the multi-billion-pound plan.</p>



<p>Three weeks later, however, both men issued statements condemning Ratcliffe&#8217;s comments. The same applied to both Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves, both of whom had previously expressed support for the redevelopment project.</p>



<p>While local officials have vowed that taxpayer money will not be used for the new stadium itself, public funds are being sought for surrounding infrastructure, including the crucial relocation of a neighbouring freight rail terminal to St Helens. </p>



<p>Burnham has also said that his office could use <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39dxdvkepro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compulsory purchase powers</a> via the development corporation to force the sale of land required for the new stadium.</p>



<p>It is unclear whether Ratcliffe&#8217;s remarks may make the ongoing negotiations more challenging, but they came at an important moment.</p>



<p>&#8220;Real harm could have been done,&#8221; one source close to the regeneration project said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The dust is still settling, and none of it is insurmountable. But the optics of the council, the mayor, and the government appearing to support his plans just became harder.&#8221;</p>



<p>United&#8217;s hope is that those involved focus on the 15,000 new homes, 48,000 new local jobs, and the billions of pounds in economic value the project is said to deliver.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/984/cpsprodpb/be6a/live/4929f8b0-0b2c-11f1-a204-b3f033b84443.jpg" alt="A billboard near Old Trafford from December 2023 depicting the welcome to Manchester sign with a picture of Sir Jim Ratcliffe" title="Ratcliffe, Man Utd and the immigration comments fallout"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The lifelong Manchester United fan bought a 27.7% stake in the club in February 2024 in a £1.25bn deal</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="This-is-a-global-club-apology-is-a-first-step-">&#8216;This is a global club&#8230; apology is a first step&#8217;</h2>



<p>It appears Ratcliffe&#8217;s relationship with many of United&#8217;s fans has been harmed too.</p>



<p>&#8220;Comments from the club&#8217;s senior leadership should make inclusion easier, not harder&#8221;, posted the Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST).</p>



<p>Ghulam Haydar of the Manchester United Muslim Supporters&#8217; Club (MUMSC) told BBC Sport that Ratcliffe&#8217;s apology was &#8220;a first step&#8221;, but said he would like the 73-year-old to agree to a meeting with their members in order to provide some assurances.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a global club… what&#8217;s he going to do to actually assure us that the club is a welcoming space for people of colour, people of migrant backgrounds?&#8221; he asked.</p>



<p>MUMSC has said it does not feel that Ratcliffe&#8217;s apology &#8220;sufficiently addresses the seriousness&#8221; of what was said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Expressing regret for causing offence is not the same as acknowledging the wider impact of words used. Leadership requires accountability as well as openness to debate.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kick It Out &#8211; which works to fight racism, sexism and homophobia in football and says overall reports about discrimination have risen again this campaign after&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kickitout.org/news-media/discrimination-football-remains-record-levels#:~:text=Kick%20It%20Out%20received%201%2C398,in%20official%20football%20policing%20data." target="_blank" rel="noopener">last season&#8217;s record high,&nbsp;external</a>&nbsp;&#8211; told BBC Sport that it has already received a number of reports about Ratcliffe&#8217;s comments.</p>



<p>Having cut jobs and raised ticket prices, Ratcliffe was the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c05007mlyd3o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject of a protest</a>&nbsp;by a supporter group just two weeks ago over the way the Ineos hierarchy has run the club since taking over football operations.</p>



<p>It will be interesting to see what kind of reception Ratcliffe receives when he next visits Old Trafford.</p>



<p>Uncertainty also surrounds the impact this could have on manager Michael Carrick &#8211; who will face questions about this issue for the first time when he addresses the media this week &#8211; along with United&#8217;s players and staff, described by the club in their statement as a &#8220;diverse group [that] reflect the history and heritage of Manchester; a city that anyone can call home.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite United&#8217;s recent upturn in form since the appointment of the former midfielder, these are challenging times for Ratcliffe and his business Ineos, the petrochemicals firm he founded and leads.</p>



<p>Last week,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ineos.com/news/ineos-group/europes-chemical-industry-faces-unsurvivable-conditions-without-urgent-action-warns-sir-jim-ratcliffe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he warned,&nbsp;external</a>&nbsp;that &#8220;current conditions for Europe&#8217;s chemical industry are unsurvivable without immediate intervention&#8221;.</p>



<p>Those concerns were the reason Ratcliffe was at an industry summit in Antwerp. And they were clearly what he intended to talk about in an interview that instead ended up with him engulfed in a fierce political storm.</p>



<p>It is a controversy that is unlikely to blow over quickly, and the true repercussions are yet to become clear.</p>

<p>The Super Clash can be unforgiving.</p>



<p>Mistakes become what fans remember and match winners are elevated to god-like status.</p>



<p>Once a while, a player emerges who takes on the pressure of this career-defining fixture, and owns it.&nbsp; It can be one game. It can be a couple.</p>



<p>But every generation has that one player who shows up and dominates the fixture.</p>



<p>On Sunday, Benjamin Asare joined those ranks.</p>



<p>What set the tone for his performance was the control he asserted over his backline.</p>



<p><strong>Asare&#8217;s command</strong></p>



<p>Asare was in complete command of the Hearts backline and the general defensive coordination.</p>



<p>Kelvin Osei-Asibey and Ali Mohammed became his wing man, who extended his authority to keep their teammates in check.</p>



<p>His constant communication ensured every part of the piece stay where they were supposed to be, never straying out of position but doing what they were supposed to do.</p>



<p>The best example of this was when Ali Mohammed moved to close down Kwame Opoku in the second half. Asare screamed Osei-Asibey to step forward and close the gap. He did and within seconds, Yaw Baafi Amankwaah had also adjusted his position accordingly to keep the spacial structure intact.</p>



<p>His contribution to their structure, partly explains why, despite playing with 10 men for 69 minutes &#8211; 15 minutes plus 5 additional in the first half and 45 second half minutes plus 4 minutes of stoppage time, Hearts remained compact and never looked in danger of conceding.</p>



<p><strong>Asare&#8217;s aerial dominance</strong></p>



<p>Apart from being captain, what gave Benjamin Asare legitimacy was the fact that his backline were assured that he would do his job.</p>



<p>On Sunday night, he claimed every cross within proximity to his six yard box.</p>



<p>Many have questioned his ascension to the Black Stars, pointing to exaggerated, and mostly non-existent flaws.</p>



<p>But here, on enemy territory, and in the biggest game of the season, Asare served a reminder of his true quality.</p>



<p>When Kotoko realized that Asare was claiming all the crosses, they tried mixing things up with long range efforts.</p>



<p>Again, Asare saved them all.</p>



<p>There was a brief moment in the 73rd minute when the Kotoko pressure peaked.</p>



<p>Not because of how often they breached the Hearts defense or how many chances they created. Just by their sheer intensity and consistency.</p>



<p>Yet, that was the very moment every knew Asare would not be beaten. He claimed every cross and saved every shot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The closest they came was Patrick Asiedu&#8217;s rifle from the left side. Like everything did Kotoko did on the night, Asare saved it, stretching low and to his elastic limit to produce a fine, finger tip save.</p>



<p>Before that, when Albert Amoah produced a surprise, snap shot after Osei-Asibey&#8217;s poor clearance, Asare was on hand to save with minimal fuss.</p>



<p>There were a few more shots and each was met with a firm grab by Asare, thanks to his excellent positioning.</p>



<p><strong>Distribution</strong></p>



<p>After Hearts went a man down, Kotoko intensified their pressing.</p>



<p>On goal kicks especially, they went man for man, ostensibly to force Benjamin Asare to go long.</p>



<p>Yet, be it through one of his defenders, a free man in the middle or long ball into soace for Karikari or Wayo to tun onto, Asare always managed to find a teammate.</p>



<p>There were a few moments where a teammate miscontrolled the ball or did not react in time and allowed the men in red to steal possession but Asare always did his job.</p>



<p>In the end, he secured his 9th clean sheet of the season in the biggest fixture.</p>



<p>Among the millions watching, were Black Stars coach Otto Addo and his coaching staff. He would be proud of the choice he made in March last year, when he made Asare Ghana&#8217;s number one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Karela United brought an end to Dreams FC&#8217;s six-game unbeaten run over the weekend as they defeated them in the Ghana Premier League.</p>



<p>The two teams met on matchday 22 of Ghana&#8217;s top flight at the Tuba Astro Turf as Dream, who were the home side, looked to continue their fine form. </p>



<p>However, Karela had other ideas as Alhassan Ali scored the only goal of the game in additional time to hand the visitors all three points. </p>
