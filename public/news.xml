										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Security expert Dr. Ishmael Norman has called on President John Dramani Mahama to appoint a woman as Ghana’s next Minister of Defence, highlighting the reputational and policy benefits such a move would bring.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on<strong> JoyNews’ The Pulse</strong>, Dr. Norman argued that it is time for Ghana to break the tradition of men occupying the Defence Ministry and for the President to select a capable female leader who understands policy, parliamentary procedures, and budgeting in the defence sector.</p>



<p>“It will be for reputational benefit, and this thing will be so high up before all women, all girls, that it will be amazing the benefits of that appointment. We are tired of men; appoint a woman, Mr. President. Please, please, appoint a woman,” he appealed.</p>



<p>On the specific female candidate he proposes, Dr. Norman named the Korle Klottey MP Dr. Zanetor Agyemang Rawlings. He highlighted her experience on the Defence and Interior subcommittee, the Intelligence subcommittee, and her participation in activities at the Ghana Armed Forces Staff College.</p>



<p>“She has quite a lot of qualifications,” he said. “She has proven her worth as a medical doctor, parliamentarian, and disciplined professional.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is not an iota of any bad thing said about her. She has been groomed for that role, and it is high time she is elevated to that position.”</p>



<p>Dr. Norman also referenced Ghana’s affirmative action law, noting that women should occupy at least 25% of top positions in every organization, a target that has not yet been met in the defence sector.</p>



<p>He urged patience, however, acknowledging that the final decision rests with President Mahama and the Council of State, and emphasised the importance of careful consultation before appointing the next Defence Minister.</p>



<p>When asked about Deputy Defence Minister Ernest Bronya Genfi, Dr. Norman described him as being careful and diplomatic in his role, particularly given the sensitive circumstances surrounding the ministry.</p>



<p>He praised him for his professionalism and commitment, noting that any future appointment would require the consultation of the President, the Council of State, and the military leadership.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A proposed Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill triggered heated exchanges in Parliament, as the government moves to restructure Ghana’s national security architecture and change the name of the National Investigations Bureau (NIB) back to Bureau of National Intelligence (BNI).</p>



<p>The bill, laid before Parliament by the Minister for the Interior, Muntaka Mohammed-Mubarak, on Thursday, February 19, seeks to address what the government describes as public confusion between the National Investigations Bureau (NIB) and the National Investment Bank, which share the same acronym.</p>



<p>Under the proposed law, the intelligence agency will revert to the name Bureau of National Intelligence (BNI), distinct from its former historical title, Bureau of National Investigation.</p>



<p>The bill also proposes a major restructuring of national security governance by scrapping the Ministry for National Security, with oversight functions to be exercised through the Presidency.</p>

<p>Presenting the bill, Mr. Mohammed-Mubarak argued that the reforms are necessary to streamline coordination and avoid institutional conflicts.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, we have a situation where you say NIB, people are wondering whether you are talking about the bank or the security agency. So one of the significant things we are trying to do is to reintroduce the name BNI… Bureau of National Intelligence,” he said.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ss_ZNTT1Hk?si=-12jpZMRYoBro-V8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>He added that the new structure is intended to prevent conflict between a Minister for National Security and the National Security Coordinator, stressing that coordination should be firmly anchored under the President with ministerial oversight rather than a standalone ministry.</p>



<p>However, the proposals immediately drew strong opposition from the Minority, who described the bill as flawed, overly centralising power, and lacking safeguards.</p>



<p>Former Defence Minister, Dominic Nitiwul, questioned the policy rationale behind the reforms, warning that the changes could create instability and weaken accountability.</p>

<p>“If in four years you are no more in power, are we expecting a new government to also bring a new Act to reflect their direction?” he asked.</p>



<p>“It will be dangerous for this nation to make that office and agency so powerful without proper accountability. It’s a misplaced priority, and if you do that, you’ll suffer.”</p>



<p>Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin also rejected the bill, arguing that it is politically motivated rather than driven by evidence-based governance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="982" height="617" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin.png" alt="Majority, Minority clash over bill to revert NIB name to BNI and overhaul national security structure" class="wp-image-10032982385" title="Majority, Minority clash over bill to revert NIB name to BNI and overhaul national security structure" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin.png 982w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-300x188.png 300w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-768x483.png 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-477x300.png 477w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-223x140.png 223w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-150x94.png 150w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-218x137.png 218w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-675x424.png 675w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-330x207.png 330w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-225x141.png 225w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-217x136.png 217w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-340x214.png 340w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-239x150.png 239w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-55x35.png 55w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" /></figure>



<p>“The memorandum before us does not provide any empirical evidence to suggest that Act 1030 has failed,” he said.</p>



<p>“So much power is being given to the coordinator, and it is not clear how his powers are going to be fettered. </p>



<p>&#8220;Without clear responsibility, accountability and oversight, this becomes problematic. When citizens’ rights are abused, it will be justified in the name of national security.”</p>



<p>He called for further consultations and amendments to incorporate concerns raised by the Minority.</p>

<p>Responding to the criticism, the Majority Leader, Mahama Ayariga, defended the bill, describing it as a correction of what he termed a “historical wrong” created by the previous administration.</p>



<p>“We decided to cut down the number of ministers, and among the ministries we guillotined was the Ministry for National Security,” he said.</p>



<p>“What you [NPP] did was to force the hand of a President to appoint a Minister for National Security. It was a wrong thing for us to have done as a Parliament, and this historical wrong has to be corrected.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Director-General of the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC), Dr Audrey Smock Amoah, has emphasised the need for strict compliance with planning guidelines and improved performance standards to ensure that development plans translate into tangible results.</p>



<p>Delivering a presentation on Plan Preparation, Annual Progress Reports (APRs), and the Regional Integrated Plan, on Thursday, 19th February 2026, Dr Amoah highlighted L.I. 2232, which governs the preparation of APRs. She commended the Eastern Region for its strong performance, noting that most APRs submitted last year were rated excellent, very good, or good.</p>



<p>However, she stressed that rankings alone are not enough.</p>



<p>“We want to get to a point where, apart from the rankings, when we step into the districts or the regions, we see actual development,” she stated, explaining that APRs must comprehensively capture annual activities, financial performance, implementation challenges, and recommendations for improvement.</p>



<p>Dr Amoah further announced that several districts had successfully secured certification of their development plans, while others were yet to address outstanding review comments.</p>



<p>“We are still waiting for you to address your comments so that you receive your certificates,” she urged, applauding compliant districts and noting that the Regional Coordinating Council had also attained certification.</p>



<p>On her part, the Eastern Regional Minister, Rita Akosua Adjei Awatey, underscored the importance of coherent and well-aligned development planning, cautioning against the persistent challenge of abandoned projects.</p>



<p>“Where there is one consolidated, comprehensive, and collectively owned development plan, the likelihood of project abandonment significantly reduces,” she said.</p>



<p>Earlier, the NDPC team paid a courtesy call on the President of the Eastern Regional House of Chiefs, who underscored the critical need for a long-term, sustainable approach to development. Reflecting on agricultural practices, he observed that while farmers may sell their produce to the highest bidder today, such short-term gains could prove costly in the future.</p>



<p>“In ten years, the farmers could be the poorest,” he cautioned, stressing that true growth must safeguard future livelihoods rather than focus solely on immediate profits.</p>



<p>He emphasised that sustainable development remains key to ensuring lasting economic progress for communities across the region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minister for Sports and Recreation, Kofi Adams, says legislation of Ghana&#8217;s sports fund is not enough to drive growth in the sector without real financial commitment.</p>



<p>Speaking in Parliament on Thursday, 19 February, Mr Adams said passing the Sports Fund Bill must be matched with practical investment if Ghana is to unlock the economic potential of sport.</p>



<p>He made the remarks as the country prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, where Ghana has been drawn in Group L alongside Panama, England and Croatia. The tournament, which begins in June, will be the Black Stars’ fifth appearance on football’s biggest stage.</p>



<p>Mr Adams said funding would be central to Ghana’s participation.</p>



<p>“Ghana has qualified for the World Cup; funding will be a key component for our participation and it is in that spirit, Speaker, I make this statement,” he said.</p>



<p>He warned that law alone cannot transform the industry.</p>



<p>“Legislation alone does not finance sports, commitment does. Globally, the sports industry exceeds $500 billion in value yet on our continent, sports contribute less than 0.5% to GDP in most countries &#8211; not because we lack talent, not because we lack passion but because we have not yet built a financing system that matches our ambition.”</p>



<p>According to the minister, the proposed Ghana Sports Fund would provide a transparent and accountable framework to support infrastructure development, school and grassroots sport, elite athlete preparation, welfare systems and recreation.</p>



<p>“The Ghana Sports Fund provides us that system. It creates a transparent and accountable framework to support infrastructural development, school and grassroots sports, elite athlete preparation welfare systems and recreation,” he added.</p>



<p>Mr Adams also commmended the National Investment Bank for donating 100,000 Ghana cedis to the fund, describing the gesture as a demonstration of leadership from the financial sector.</p>



<p>He said meaningful reform in Ghana’s sports industry would depend not only on Parliament passing the bill, but on sustained financial backing from both government and private institutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Deputy National Communications Director of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Kamal-Deen Abdulai, has questioned the clarity and application of Article 146 of Ghana’s 1992 Constitution, describing it as potentially “the most confused position” in the supreme law at the moment.</p>



<p>Article 146 of the 1992 Constitution outlines the procedures and grounds for the removal of justices of the superior courts and other high-ranking officials on the basis of stated misbehaviour or incompetence.</p>



<p>Speaking on the Joy News AM Show on Thursday, 19th February, Mr Abdulai raised concerns about what he suggested could be a selective interpretation of the constitutional provision governing the removal of certain public officers, including the Chief Justice.</p>



<p>“Is there a case of cherry-picking or selective application of the law here when it comes to Article 146 of the Constitution? It’s a question somebody would ask,” he said.</p>



<p>“Lawyers have also exposed their positions on what we heard yesterday and read. That looks like the most confused position of the Constitution at the moment is Article 146.”</p>



<p>Mr Abdulai noted that many legal commentators had weighed in on the matter, offering differing interpretations of what amounts to “stated misbehaviour”.</p>



<p>“Many people have actually been there. And some of these, when they come out, the legal pundits or legal luminaries will come out with their various angles. What actually constitutes a misbehavior is what the CJ is saying,” he stated.</p>



<p>Referring to a recent communication emanating from the Jubilee House, Mr Abdulai cited portions of what has been described as the “Green Letter,&#8221; which addressed a petition seeking a prima facie determination.</p>



<p>“That look, from what we have received and read, it is evident on the face of it that some constitutional questions were raised, administrative questions were raised, but they don&#8217;t meet the threshold to determine a prima facie case,” he said.</p>



<p>He added that a full publication of the reasoning behind the decision would be instructive.</p>



<p>“It will be interesting to have a full report. Because I know that when justices of their caliber sit, they don&#8217;t just write English. They derive their positions from laws; they derive their positions from determined cases, which are precedents. And they derive their positions from textbooks and all that.”</p>



<p>Mr Abdulai stressed that transparency in such high-level constitutional matters was crucial, particularly after the President had been furnished with the report.</p>



<p>“It’s just unfortunate what the law says. Whether after furnishing the President with it, the President would make it available for all of us to read, to get to know the ratio or the reasons behind the decision of the Chief Justice,” he said.</p>



<p>Quoting directly from the letter issued from the Presidency, he read, &#8220;While the allegations raised serious constitutional and administrative questions, they do not, on their face, meet the threshold required for a prima facie determination of stated misbehavior or incompetence, warranting that a committee be set up to inquire into the petition.”</p>



<p>“The petition largely rests on conclusions of unlawfulness and bad faith without establishing a preliminary level, clear facts, demonstrating intentional wrongdoing, or a manifest inability to perform constitutional functions,” he continued.</p>



<p>“Even if the commission&#8217;s actions or inactions are assumed to be erroneous, controversial, or suboptimal, such shortcomings do not automatically translate into stated misbehavior.”</p>



<p>Mr Abdulai argued that these conclusions had triggered broader public debate about consistency in applying Article 146, particularly in light of previous determinations by the Council of State.</p>



<p>“Thus, I’m saying that some lawyers, after reading this, say, At what point can a stated misbehavior actually be impugned?” he said.</p>



<p>“Not only lawyers, but commonsensical people would also say this. Because yesterday, we were told that same Article 146, Council of State, was able to establish, if you like, a prima facie case against not just anybody, but a certain Chief Justice.”</p>



<p>He contrasted the current reasoning with earlier cases where alleged breaches of administrative procedures, including travel policies, were said to have met the threshold for a prima facie case.</p>



<p>“And when ratios were asked to be given, we’re told that she traveled, and the travel policy was infringed upon. We’re told that there was some administrative infringement, and then if this one talks about some administrative questions and infringements, and yesterday was actually meeting the threshold of a prima facie, why not today?” he queried.</p>



<p>Mr Abdulai stated that his concerns were not directed at any particular institution.</p>



<p>“I’m not actually against the OSP or the EC, but I’m trying to say that our law should actually be so clear to us that it will not leave us in a state of confusion, as it were,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Chairman of the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC), Dr Nii Moi Thompson, has reiterated the need for a consolidated long term national development plan to replace Ghana’s fragmented and largely unimplemented past frameworks.</p>



<p>During the ongoing regional consultative engagement with key stakeholders in the Eastern Region on Thursday, 19 February 2026, Dr Thompson delivered a presentation on the proposed long term national development plan, emphasising the importance of a clear national vision and noting that policy discontinuity has undermined national progress.</p>



<p>He referenced previous initiatives such as Ghana Beyond Aid and Vision 2057, stressing that long term planning is not about predicting the future, but about defining goals and working systematically to achieve them.</p>



<p>“We cannot proceed with an incrementalist approach to development,” he noted, warning that without deliberate and sustained planning, Ghana risks stagnation.</p>



<p>He identified informality as “the weakest link” in the country’s development, observing that while 92 per cent of businesses operate in the informal sector and employ nearly 90 per cent of the workforce, they contribute only about 20 per cent to GDP due to low value addition.</p>



<p>Dr Thompson therefore urged district assemblies to prioritise economic formalisation, business development, and models such as the Start and Improve Your Business initiative to enhance productivity and competitiveness.</p>



<p>Dr Thompson also called for greater adoption of technology, particularly Artificial Intelligence, to modernise planning processes and improve efficiency.</p>



<p>He disclosed that the Commission has already begun exploring AI tools following a recent introductory session.</p>



<p>“It will help to minimise the workload and expedite certain processes for us,” he noted, adding that he has personally used AI to summarise district development plans effectively.</p>



<p>He expressed optimism that once fully institutionalised at the Commission level, the innovation would be extended to the regions and district assemblies.</p>



<p>Turning to governance and maintenance culture, he emphasised that development is not only about constructing new infrastructure but also about preserving existing assets. Drawing on the broken window theory, he cautioned that neglecting minor defects inevitably leads to systemic deterioration.</p>



<p>“The second you see this, you are supposed to prevent it,” he remarked, citing road encroachment, school erosion, and the destruction of pavements as examples of avoidable decline that ultimately place additional burdens on government resources.</p>



<p>The Regional Minister described the Commission’s long term national development plan as timely and commendable, emphasising that its success will depend on effective implementation, inclusivity, and accountability.</p>



<p>“A better tomorrow is dependent on our collective decisions and actions today,” she concluded, urging stakeholders to ensure that development remains people centred, strategic, and sustainable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana’s Minister for Sports and Recreation, Kofi Adams, says he will donate two months of his salary to the Ghana Sports Fund.</p>



<p>He made the announcement while speaking in Parliament, where he stressed the need for the Sports Fund Bill to be passed into law. He said the fund could make a strong contribution to Ghana’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and help transform sports financing in the country.</p>



<p>The minister made the pledge after commending the National Investment Bank for donating GHC 100,000 to the fund.</p>



<p>“I will donate two months of my salary to the Ghana Sports Fund effective February 2026,” Mr Adams said.</p>



<p>“If we expect the private sector to invest, if we expect (Sports) Federations to reform, if we expect young athletes to commit, then leadership must also commit.”</p>



<p>He also called on fellow lawmakers and government officials to support the initiative.</p>



<p>“I respectfully call on members of this house, Ministers of State and the Executive to support this fund in tangible ways. Government has delivered the framework,” he added.</p>



<p>The Ghana Sports Fund is designed to mobilise resources to support sports development, infrastructure, and athlete welfare across the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Majority Chief Whip in Parliament, Rockson Dafeamekpor, has promised to donate three months of his salary to help the growth of the Ghana Sports Fund. </p>



<p>The Ghana Sports Fund, passed into existence earlier this year, serves as the dedicated source of funding for the development of sports in Ghana.</p>



<p>The multi-source Sports Development Fund is designed to support athlete welfare, infrastructure development, grassroots sport, and systematic talent identification.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the National Investment Bank (NIB) made its first donation to the fund, expressing its commitment to the development of sports in the country. </p>



<p>That action has been followed by Dafeamekpor, who has also decided to donate to the fund.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Chief Whip has asked me to announce that he is committing three months of his salary [to the Ghana Sports Fund,&#8221; Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga said in Parliament on Thursday. </p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">‘I will invite the Special Prosecutor to come and find out how he’s going to survive for the three months’ – Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga jokes after his Chief Whip donated three months’ salary to the Sports Fund<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JoySports?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#JoySports</a> <a href="https://t.co/EY2zqOjjg1">pic.twitter.com/EY2zqOjjg1</a></p>&mdash; #JoySports (@JoySportsGH) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoySportsGH/status/2024512389937344642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>The bill’s passage marks a significant policy move aimed at addressing longstanding funding challenges in the sector, with government hopeful that the fund will provide a more structured and reliable source of support for Ghanaian sports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If the moral arc of a nation is to bend toward justice, the instruments of its political parties must first be tempered in the fires of integrity.</p>



<p>The National Democratic Congress has signaled that its commitment to the &#8220;Reset Ghana&#8221; agenda is not merely a pulpit for public consumption, but a mandate for internal purification.</p>



<p>By moving with surgical speed following the submission of a preliminary investigative report to the Functional Executive Committee, the party has transformed a localized inquiry into a national crusade for democratic sanctity.</p>



<p>​The directive, issued by General Secretary Fifi Fiavi Kwetey, marks a pivotal transition from reactive discipline to proactive reformation. What began as a specific probe into allegations of financial inducement during the Ayawaso East Constituency internal elections has now blossomed into a comprehensive overhaul of the party’s electoral culture.</p>



<p>The &#8220;canker&#8221; of vote-buying, as the party candidly describes it, is no longer being treated as a peripheral nuisance but as a systemic threat that requires the most formidable intellectual and political shielding.</p>



<p>​To this end, the committee led by the venerable Hon. Kofi Totobi Quakyi has been significantly bolstered with a new guard of legal and political heavyweights.</p>



<p>The inclusion of Hon. Rockson-Nelson Dafeamekpor, Hon. Barbara Serwaa Asamoah, Mahdi Gibrill, and Courage Kwabena Barlon creates a formidable brain trust tasked with a singular, high-stakes mission: to research, consult, and legislate internal measures that ensure leadership is won through the strength of ideas rather than the weight of a purse.</p>



<p>​This expansion is a masterstroke of political symbolism that mirrors the government’s broader aspirations for the Republic. A party that seeks to reset a nation’s economy must first prove it can reset its own soul.</p>



<p>By empowering this committee to &#8220;consult widely&#8221; and deliver &#8220;sustainable measures,&#8221; the NDC is attempting to bridge the chasm between constitutional ideals and the gritty reality of political competition.</p>



<p>It is a recognition that the credibility of a government is inextricably linked to the purity of the process that birthed its leadership.</p>



<p>​Ultimately, the Functional Executive Committee’s decision rests on the conviction that a &#8220;Reset&#8221; is only as strong as the foundation upon which it is built.</p>



<p>As the party prepares for future electoral cycles, this reconstituted body serves as both a shield against corruption and a beacon of a new political era.</p>



<p>The message is clear: the NDC is no longer content to merely talk about change; it is doing the difficult, necessary work of building a house of integrity from the inside out, ensuring that the democratic culture of the party remains a standard-bearer for the nation at large.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The New Patriotic Party (NPP) Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, Vincent Ekow Assafuah, has alleged a conflict-of-interest situation at the crisis-hit Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) involving some top management members.</p>



<p>In an extensive post on his Facebook page on Thursday, the MP alleged that the Chief Executive Officer of COCOBOD, Dr Randy Abbey, and his Acting Deputy in charge of Finance and Administration, Ato Boateng, are linked to a company, Atlas Commodities Limited, which he claims is involved in the purchase of cocoa.</p>



<p>According to the MP, a search at the Registrar-General’s Department reveals that both the Chief Executive Officer and his acting deputy are associated with Atlas Commodities. </p>



<p>He further alleges that the company has been buying cocoa using funds meant for Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs), including Produce Buying Companies (PBCs).</p>



<p>The MP published what he described as evidence of a waybill issued in the name of Atlas Commodities Limited, indicating the movement of cocoa from Kedjebi within the 2025/2026 crop season.</p>



<p>The document shared by the MP allegedly references 800 bags of Grade One cocoa, and he raised “legitimate questions” about the operational role of the private company within the cocoa purchasing chain.</p>

<p>Below is the full article by the MP:</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong>BIG SCANDAL LOOMING AT COCOBOD</strong></p>



<p>One of the reasons cocoa farmers continue to endure hardship under the current COCOBOD administration is what appears to be blatant insensitivity and possible abuse of office.</p>



<p>Serious concerns have emerged regarding the leadership of COCOBOD under Randy Abbey and his deputy, Mr Ato Boateng, Acting Deputy Chief Executive (Finance &amp; Administration), whose established professional association with Atlas Commodities Limited is confirmed by records at the Registrar-General’s Department and further corroborated by publicly available information, including a simple Google or AI search, which shows that he has been the company’s Chief Executive Officer since 2018.</p>



<p>Attached is a waybill issued in the name of Atlas Commodities Limited indicating the movement of cocoa from Kedjebi within the 2025/2026 crop season. The document references 800 bags of Grade One cocoa, raising legitimate questions about the operational role of this private company within the cocoa purchasing chain.</p>



<p>It is alleged that funds meant for Licensed Buying Companies, including PBCs, to purchase cocoa were instead redirected to this private entity, with cocoa allegedly hoarded in anticipation of future price increases.</p>



<p>These alleged activities are said to be taking place in parts of the Central and Eastern Regions, raising concerns about the scale of the operation.</p>



<p>COCOBOD is the regulator of all Licensed Buying Companies. Therefore, how can the regulator of the industry be seen to operate, directly or indirectly, as a buying company within the same system it supervises? If true, this would represent a serious conflict of interest and a breach of regulatory integrity.</p>



<p>Further claims suggest that Atlas Commodities Limited does not operate its own warehouses but may be relying on existing PBC warehouse facilities.</p>



<p>Most concerning is the allegation that Atlas Commodities may be operating within warehouses registered under PBC. COCOBOD regulations require that every warehouse be registered under a specific Licensed Buying Company. If a warehouse is registered under PBC, it should not be used for the storage, grading, sealing or processing of cocoa belonging to another company.</p>



<p>If proven, such an arrangement would constitute a serious regulatory breach and raise critical questions for the district Quality Control Officers responsible for oversight.</p>



<p>Additionally, it is being alleged that the Chief Executive has withheld a task force report related to these matters, preventing the public from knowing the full extent of its findings.</p>



<p>These are grave concerns that demand urgent and independent investigation. The matter has reportedly been brought to the attention of the Jasikan and Hohoe Police Stations.</p>



<p>Cocoa farmers deserve transparency, accountability and protection from any actions that undermine their livelihoods.</p>

<p>Residents of Atwima Behenease, a community in the Atwima Kwanwoma Municipality of Ashanti Region, are pleading with the government to intervene and rehabilitate the critically damaged &#8220;Abɔgyesɛ&#8221; River Bridge.</p>



<p>The bridge is on the edge of a disaster, coming under the strain of the recent heavy rains.</p>



<p>This has left residents worried and stranded, as transportation to access essential services has halted.</p>



<p>The bridge serves as a crucial link for surrounding communities, including Atwima Boko, Twedie, Trabuom, and Nkawie, facilitating the movement of people and goods.</p>



<p>A visit to the bridge revealed that it has been severely damaged by heavy rains, with both sides washed away, leaving only a narrow passage for vehicles and pedestrians.</p>



<p>Afia Akyaa, a resident, made an urgent plea to the government to intervene and repair the bridge, which is critical for Atwima Behenease and surrounding communities.</p>



<p>&#8220;The condition of the bridge is extremely hazardous, and we&#8217;re calling on the authorities to take immediate action, rather than waiting for disaster to strike,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Kwadwo Mensah, another resident, shed light on the appalling condition of the road, stating that it&#8217;s in a really bad shape.</p>



<p>&#8220;The entire road is in a terrible state, so if they can&#8217;t manage to fix it all, the least they could do is repair the bridge, which is a major concern for us&#8221;.</p>



<p>Kwaku Antwi, a former unit committee chairman for Akyeremade-Kwanwoma Electoral Area, stated that the bridge has been in a state of disrepair for 8 months now.</p>



<p>He said the community, led by the queen mother and elders, has reached out to the relevant authorities, including the DCE, MP, and Feeder Roads, but no action has been taken to fix the bridge.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just two weeks ago, two cars, one of which was carrying students, nearly crashed on the bridge. It was only God&#8217;s intervention that prevented the accident from happening, otherwise, we might have lost lives.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every time we approach the authorities, they assure us that plans are underway to fix the bridge, but it seems like they&#8217;re just paying lip service. It&#8217;s frustrating because it feels like they are waiting for a disaster to happen before taking real action, then they&#8217;ll probably show up with condolences and promises of help. Meanwhile, we&#8217;re the ones living with the risk every day,&#8221; he lamented.</p>

<p>Ghana’s Minister for Sports and Recreation, Kofi Adams, has pledged to donate two months of his salary to the newly established Sports Fund, following the passage of the Sports Fund Bill by the Parliament of Ghana.</p>



<p>Speaking on the floor of Parliament, Hon. Adams described the fund as a critical step toward revitalising sports development in the country and ensuring sustainable financing for athletes and federations.</p>



<p>The Minister said his decision to commit two months of his salary was a personal demonstration of support for the initiative and a call to action for other stakeholders to contribute towards the growth of sports in Ghana.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“I will donate two months of my salary to the Ghana Sports Fund.”<br><br>Hon. Kofi Adams speaking on the Sports Fund during parliamentary proceedings.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JoySports?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#JoySports</a> <a href="https://t.co/OgxjFdHjxB">pic.twitter.com/OgxjFdHjxB</a></p>&mdash; #JoySports (@JoySportsGH) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoySportsGH/status/2024515460146819556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>The Sports Fund is expected to serve as a dedicated financial vehicle to support grassroots sports, infrastructure development, athlete preparation, and the general promotion of sporting excellence nationwide.</p>



<p>The bill’s passage marks a significant policy move aimed at addressing longstanding funding challenges in the sector, with government hopeful that the fund will provide a more structured and reliable source of support for Ghanaian sports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Chamber of Oil Marketing Companies (COMAC) and the Chamber of Bulk Oil Distribution Companies (CBOD), have threatened to embark on a strike over the alleged unlawful diversion of funds from the LPG Fund to the Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing Company (GCMC).</p>



<p>In a joint statement, the two associations vowed to explore all legal means to reverse the action.</p>



<p>According to them, the move constitutes a flagrant breach of statutory mandate, a dangerous sabotage of national energy policy, and an unacceptable betrayal of public trust. They described the alleged diversion as a blatant deviation from the fund’s original purpose.</p>



<p>The associations are demanding the immediate reversal of the action through the following measures:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cease all disbursements to GCMC from the LPG Fund immediately.</li>



<li>Reverse any allocations already made to GCMC and restore the funds to their lawful purpose.</li>



<li>Reaffirm statutory mandate &#8211; Government must publicly confirm that the LPG Fund will finance only bottling plants, CRM rollout, and unsafe cylinder withdrawal.</li>



<li>Guarantee transparency &#8211; Implement quarterly public reporting on all fund utilisation with independent audit verification.</li>
</ol>



<p>They added that &#8220;These are not industry requests. These are legal and moral imperatives.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>According to COMAC and CBOD, the eLPG Fund was established under Legislative Instruments LI 2262, as amended, and LI 2481, and implemented by the National Petroleum Authority, NPA, on April 1, 2024, with three explicit, legally binding objectives:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>USD 44/MT Bottling Plant Margin &#8211; To finance construction and operation of LPG bottling plants nationwide.</li>



<li>USD 36/MT Cylinder Investment Margin &#8211; To fund the Cylinder Recirculation Model, CRM, rollout for safe and efficient LPG distribution.</li>
</ol>



<p>They argued that these purposes are non-negotiable.</p>



<p>They further noted that &#8220;the fund was never intended as discretionary capital for ad hoc allocations&#8221;.</p>



<p>The associations also maintained that &#8220;redirecting it to GCMC is not administrative flexibility it is a statutory violation that demolishes the foundation of Ghana&#8217;s LPG safety and infrastructure framework.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Government’s Intervention</strong></p>



<p>The two associations are calling on government to urgently address the matter, stating that &#8220;This moment demands decision: Will Ghana uphold the rule of law and protect its citizens, or will it condone misallocation, erode energy sector credibility, and sacrifice lives for bureaucratic convenience?&#8221;</p>



<p>They also stated that COMAC and CBOD will pursue every legitimate avenue, policy, legal, and public, to defend the LPG Fund&#8217;s rightful utilisation.</p>



<p>“We will not permit this fund to become a discretionary slush account. We will not remain passive while statutory protections are shredded,&#8221; they added.</p>



<p>They further cautioned that “we will not accept anything less than full accountability, decisive leadership, and restoration of fund integrity.&#8221;</p>



<p>“The people of Ghana deserve nothing less than protection, transparency, and respect for the law; the government must now decide which side of that equation it occupies,” they argued in the joint statement.</p>



<p>The associations also maintained that &#8220;we will explore all options to protect our interest and preserve our right as key stakeholders under the structure.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Women of Valour 2026 has been launched at the residence of the British High Commission to Ghana in Accra with policymakers, media professionals, activists and survivors in attendance.</p>



<p>The event was held on 17th February 2026 under the theme “The Pursuit of Fearlessness.”</p>



<p>At the centre of the launch were emotional testimonies from abuse survivors, whose experiences are shaping this year’s advocacy focus.</p>



<p>Musician Diana Hopeson recounted how a marriage she entered at age 21, believing shared Christian values would guarantee peace, gradually became emotionally abusive behind closed doors.</p>



<p>Despite her public image as a successful musician, she revealed that she endured repeated threats on her life.</p>



<p>“My breaking point was when he threatened to drive our car into a truck so we would both die, simply because I smiled with fans after an event,” she said.</p>



<p>She added that there were also threats to obtain a weapon and kill them both, a situation that eventually forced her to leave and seek help.</p>



<p>Actor and advocate Vicky Zugah also shared her painful experience, beginning with a relationship in 2013 that quickly turned violent.</p>



<p>“He dragged me into a room and threatened to stab me,” she recounted. “Another time, he tried to drive into a mountain with me in the car.”</p>



<p>After leaving that relationship, she entered another which she said became physically abusive even during pregnancy.</p>



<p>“He beat me and threatened to kill me and my unborn child, saying nothing would happen because we live in Ghana,” she said, adding that the most painful part was being blamed by some for the failure of her relationships.</p>



<p>Speaking at the launch, Director of the Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit, Owusuwaa Kyeremeh, assured women and young people that protection mechanisms are in place.</p>



<p>“We are ready to fight for women and the youth. No matter the status or class of the person involved, report the abuse and it will be dealt with appropriately,” she stated.</p>



<p>She noted that DOVVSU has been operational since 1998 and continues to strengthen its response systems as cases of abuse evolve.</p>



<p>Founder of Women of Valour, Nana Aba Anamoah, said the courage of survivors directly inspired this year’s theme.</p>



<p>“These are not isolated cases. Too many women suffer in silence because they are afraid afraid of judgment and afraid of not being believed,” she said.</p>



<p>According to her, “The Pursuit of Fearlessness” is about creating safe spaces where women can speak up without fear and trust that institutions will protect them.</p>



<p>The main Women of Valour 2026 event is scheduled to take place on 7 March in London, where stakeholders are expected to continue discussions on collaboration between the media, policymakers and activists to protect women and girls.</p>

<p>The Commissioner-General of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), Mr. Anthony Kwasi Sarpong, has confirmed that the interception of 17 trucks loaded with suspected smuggled cooking oil is part of intensified anti-smuggling enforcement measures to protect Ghana’s economy.</p>



<p>Describing the operation as a “decisive blow against economic sabotage”, Mr. Sarpong said on Thursday, February 19, that the intelligence-led midnight raid uncovered an alleged transit diversion scheme in which goods declared for Burkina Faso and Niger were diverted into Ghana through the Akanu corridor.</p>

<p>“This is about protecting Ghana’s economy,” Mr. Sarpong emphasised.</p>



<p>Twelve trucks have been impounded, with five reportedly still being tracked.</p>



<p>Trucks identified include:</p>



<p>GT 9656-25, TG 8906-BR, 11KG8968-BF, AS 7300-15, AS 8894-10, TG 6973-AN, 6074E403-BF, TG 6972-AN, TG 2285-AU, TG 1768-BP, TG 7203-BD, TG 2398-BD, TG 5032-BN, TG 8734-AW, TG 0739-AN, TG 3417-BR, TG 0435-BM.</p>

<p>Authorities say the diversion could have deprived the state of import duties, VAT, ECOWAS trade revenue, and critical protection for local edible oil producers.</p>



<p>“If you want to trade in Ghana, pay your tax. If you attempt to cheat the system, you will lose your goods and your trucks,” the Commissioner-General warned.</p>



<p>The GRA announced it will hold a national press briefing and launch deeper investigations to identify and prosecute the masterminds behind the syndicate.</p>

<p>The crackdown follows recent concerns raised by the Food and Beverages Association of Ghana (FABAG) during a meeting with the Minister of Finance, Cassiel Ato Forson, calling for tighter border security to curb smuggling.</p>



<p>Officials say the operation has boosted public confidence and signals a new era of strict enforcement against revenue leakages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A woman arrested in connection with the alleged theft of a four-day-old baby boy from the Mamprobi Polyclinic remains in police custody and is expected to be put before the court in due course, the Accra Regional Police Command has confirmed.</p>



<p>In a press statement issued on Thursday, 19 February, the suspect, identified as Latifa Salifu, was apprehended on Wednesday, 18 February 2026, following what police described as intensive investigations into the reported abduction.</p>



<p>The incident was first reported to the Mamprobi District Police Command on Tuesday, 17 February 2026, after an unidentified woman, allegedly disguised as a nurse, unlawfully entered the postnatal ward of the Mamprobi Polyclinic and stole a newborn baby boy belonging to Precious Ankomah.</p>



<p>Acting on intelligence gathered, officers from the Dansoman Divisional Command tracked down and arrested Ms Salifu at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, where she was found in possession of the four-day-old child.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="771" height="1024" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-771x1024.png" alt="Mamprobi Polyclinic baby theft suspect to appear in court" class="wp-image-10032982261" title="Mamprobi Polyclinic baby theft suspect to appear in court" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-771x1024.png 771w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-226x300.png 226w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-768x1019.png 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-105x140.png 105w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-94x125.png 94w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-188x250.png 188w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-113x150.png 113w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-319x424.png 319w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-38x50.png 38w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907.png 1136w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" /></figure>



<p>Preliminary investigations indicate that the suspect was unable to provide medical records or documentation to support her claim that she had delivered the baby at the hospital. She was subsequently arrested and detained to assist with ongoing enquiries.</p>



<p>The baby has since been safely reunited with his mother, Ms Ankomah, who positively identified her son through a distinctive birthmark on his left leg. The child has been referred to Korle Bu Teaching Hospital for further medical assessment and care.</p>



<p>In response to the incident, the Regional Police Command has introduced heightened security measures at the Mamprobi Polyclinic. Twenty-four-hour police protection has been deployed at the facility to ensure the safety of patients, staff and visitors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1908-768x1024.png" alt="Mamprobi Polyclinic baby theft suspect to appear in court" class="wp-image-10032982263" title="Mamprobi Polyclinic baby theft suspect to appear in court"></figure>



<p>Police emphasised that Latifa Salifu remains in custody assisting with investigations and will be put before the court in due course, as authorities work to establish the full circumstances surrounding the case.</p>



<p>“The Accra Regional Police Command cautions the general public to remain vigilant, particularly within healthcare facilities, and to promptly report any suspicious behaviour or persons to the nearest Police Station. Hospital authorities are encouraged to strictly regulate access to maternity and postnatal wards,” the statement concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Experiencing The Blend Festival firsthand has been truly remarkable. For Prudential Bank, this is what sponsorship should feel like: being part of moments that matter, celebrating diversity, and connecting with the very people and businesses we serve every day. As a Bank we provide support for the Creative sector in the form of export support. This festival is a testament to the unifying power of music, and we are proud to have powered it in partnership with Rana Motors,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Commenting, the Chief Executive Officer of Rana Motors, Essam Odaymat, who is also a member of the Blend Band expressed his surprise at the turnout saying, this is another way the vehicle manufacturing and sales company gives back to support the Creative Industry.</p>

<p>“As a company, we are dedicated to the government’s 24-hour Economy Policy. We have an assembly plant in Ghana which provides employment and production around the clock. Producing and supporting the Blend Festival is yet another way we support the Creative Arts industry by offering a platform for musicians and other players in the industry to deploy their talents, make sales and earn a living”, he said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As the curtains fell on a spectacular night of music and connection, what lingered was a sense of community, lasting memories, strengthened relationships and renewed anticipation for future editions.&nbsp; The Blend Festival 2026 had delivered on its promise, a celebration where diversity, creativity, and commerce converged.</p>



<p>The Blend Festival was organised by Pidgen Music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mr Davisson-Konu has shared the inspiring journey of how he reunited and married his Junior High School sweetheart, revealing that his late mother had always encouraged him to marry his first love.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview with <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0">Roselyn Felli</a> on Changes on <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1">JoyPrime</a>, Mr Davisson-Konu said their love story began in 1993 during their Junior High School days. Young, hopeful and deeply connected, they shared a bond that felt special even then. In their innocence, they promised each other that one day they would become husband and wife. However, life had other plans.</p>



<p>He explained that after completing JHS, circumstances pulled them apart. They lost contact and went on separate paths, each trying to build a future independently. Along the way, both experienced marriage but not without hardship. Mrs Davisson-Konu revealed that she lost her first husband, while Mr Konu also divorced his first wife.</p>



<p>Despite the distance, the years and the trials of life, Mr Konu said the love he once felt for Nancy still lingered in his heart. In his bid to find her, he sent a message to his old school lover on Facebook. At first, there was no response. But when she eventually replied, everything changed. Conversations resumed effortlessly, as though time had stood still. The connection was instant, genuine and deeper than before.</p>



<p>Mrs Davisson-Konu added that their reconnection made it clear that they had found in each other something rare and peaceful. Later on the show, Mr Konu said they dated for a year, rediscovering their bond and strengthening their friendship before finally deciding to get married. He added that his late mother had always advised him to marry his JHS lover, and looking back, it felt like a prophecy fulfilled.</p>



<p>They both expressed their feelings on their wedding day, saying there was no anxiety or doubt, only calm and certainty. It felt right. Their marriage has since been marked by peace, minimal conflict and strong support for one another. According to the husband, his wife sees things he often misses, proving that women possess insight that holds families together.</p>



<p>Their union, he noted, is also strengthened by how well their careers complement each other. While the husband is into event planning, the wife is a professional caterer. Interestingly, this same line of work caused challenges in the husband’s previous marriage. However, it has become a blessing in his new marriage because they walk the journey together.</p>



<p>Given the opportunity to share warm words with each other, the husband described his wife as the greatest joy of his life, promising to stand by her side through every season and circumstance. He also expressed deep gratitude for her presence and unwavering love.</p>



<p>The wife, in turn, said she knew from the very first day they reconnected that he was meant for her. She said she cherishes their late-night conversations and described him as not just her husband, but the missing piece in her life.</p>



<p>Their story, they noted, stands as a reminder that love does not always follow a straight path. Sometimes it pauses and sometimes it hides, but when it is true, it finds its way back.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The government has been commended for its commitment to boosting the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) education system in the country.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The government has been commended for its commitment to strengthening the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) sector, as the Kwadaso Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), Eric Asibey, cut sod for major infrastructure projects at the Business Secretarial and Technical Institute (BSTI) at Asuoyeboah in the Ashanti Region.</p>



<p>Principal of BSTI, Abena Mansah Foriwaah, praised the government’s sustained investment in TVET when the ceremony was held at the school.</p>



<p>The two projects include the construction of a three-storey classroom block with a two-bedroom principal’s apartment and a six-unit staff flat, awarded to Cape Tree Company Limited, as well as a multipurpose TVET centre, awarded to SG Two-Trust Company Limited.</p>



<p>The projects are expected to be completed within 24 months and 30 months, respectively, providing much-needed facilities for the institute.</p>



<p>Ms Foriwaah acknowledged the previous government’s efforts in initiating investments in technical and vocational institutions and welcomed the current administration’s commitment to sustaining and expanding those investments to boost the sector’s growth.</p>



<p>She noted that BSTI has been grappling with inadequate infrastructure and learning resources and expressed optimism that the new projects would significantly ease the situation.</p>



<p>“We were facing a lot of challenges, including a lack of teachers’ accommodation, inadequate classrooms and other infrastructure. Timely completion of this project will provide excellent teaching and learning facilities, as well as monitoring and supervision, to maintain the school’s vision of being the best in the training of engineers, secretaries and other professional personnel,” she said.</p>



<p>Ms Foriwaah added that the government has assured management that funds for the completion of the projects will be disbursed promptly, and expressed hope that the contractors would adhere to the timelines.</p>



<p>In an interview, Mr Asibey revealed that the projects are being funded by the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETFund) under the New Targeted and Emergency Projects (NTEmP) initiative. He said the projects form part of efforts to improve educational infrastructure and enhance the learning environment in the municipality.</p>



<p>He expressed gratitude to President John Dramani Mahama for driving development across the country and underscored the importance of quality education in shaping Ghana’s future generations.</p>



<p>The MCE urged the contractors to adhere strictly to project specifications and timelines, noting that funding has already been secured.</p>



<p>“President Mahama is committed to completing all the projects initiated by the previous government, and, for that matter, he cannot abandon his own projects. So, the consultant needs to keep an eye on the contractors and ensure that top-notch materials are being used and that deadlines are met,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Asibey also stressed the need to engage local skilled labour to create employment opportunities for young people in the municipality.</p>



<p>“We want to see the involvement of our local people — masons, carpenters and other artisans — in this project, and we appeal to the contractor to prioritise the use of local resources,” he added.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Engineer Richard Addo-Gyamfi, Ashanti Regional Director of the Ghana Technical and Vocational Education and Training Service (GTVET), raised concerns about encroachment on the school’s land due to the absence of infrastructure and a boundary wall.</p>



<p>He made an urgent appeal to the relevant authorities and stakeholders to intervene and prevent further encroachments to safeguard the future of the institute.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Security expert Ishmael Norman has described recent comments by former Defence Minister Dominic Nitiwul as unfair and has called on him to apologise.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on JoyNews’ The Pulse, Dr Norman argued that Mr Nitiwul’s assertion that the absence of a substantive Defence Minister has left Ghana vulnerable was overly broad and disparaging to the country’s security institutions.</p>



<p>His remarks follow Mr Nitiwul’s sharp criticism of President John Dramani Mahama over the prolonged vacancy at the Ministry of Defence. The former minister had warned that Ghana’s security architecture was being exposed amid rising regional threats, particularly after the killing of eight Ghanaian traders in Burkina Faso.</p>



<p>“It is not very fair for Honourable Dominic Nitiwul to say that the absence of a substantive Defence Minister has rendered Ghana weak. That is a bit insulting to all the major generals, brigadier generals, colonels, the Chief of Defence Staff, all the way down the military hierarchy,” Dr Norman said.</p>



<p>“One civilian with no military experience who becomes Minister of Defence is not going to micro-manage the generals in the military,” he added. “His statement is too broad, too raw, and it alienates those working to keep Ghana safe.”</p>



<p>He further noted that countries without standing armies often maintain strong security systems through well-trained police, immigration and customs services, stressing that national security is not solely dependent on the military.</p>



<p>Dr Norman maintained that although he holds Mr Nitiwul in high regard, the comments were biased and partisan.</p>



<p>“I believe he should really apologise for that statement,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Member of Parliament for Ayawaso West Wuogon, John Dumelo, has announced plans to provide free Ghana-made cocoa drinks to public basic school pupils in his constituency.</p>



<p>In a statement, the MP said the initiative will start on March 2 and will benefit pupils from Class One to Class Four.</p>



<p>According to him, the programme aims to support the nutritional needs of schoolchildren while promoting locally made products.</p>



<p>“From 2nd March 2026, I will be providing free Ghana-made cocoa drinks to all public basic pupils from Class 1 to 4 in my beloved Ayawaso West Constituency,” he stated.</p>



<p>He added that the initiative has multiple benefits: boosting local industry by sourcing exclusively Ghana-made products to support cocoa farmers and local manufacturers, enhancing school attendance by providing nutritious incentives, and fostering national pride by helping children appreciate Ghana’s cocoa heritage.</p>



<p>“This programme is a testament to our belief that a healthy child is a teachable child,” the statement concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mfantsipim Senior High School has outlined a five-pillar reform agenda to strengthen academic, infrastructure and national education impact as the school prepares to mark its sesquicentennial.</p>



<p>Addressing a pre-launch press briefing in Accra yesterday, the Chairman of the 150th Anniversary Planning Committee, John B. Yamoah, said the anniversary would go beyond ceremonial observance and serve as a strategic platform to consolidate the institution’s legacy while repositioning it for the future.</p>



<p>“For a century and a half, Mfantsipim has shaped generations of leaders &#8211; statesmen, professionals, academics, clergy, sportsmen, and innovators-men who have served the nation and the world with distinction.</p>



<p>“This Sesquicentennial is, therefore, more than a school anniversary-it is a national celebration of 150 years of secondary education in Ghana,” he added.</p>



<p>Founded in 1876 by the Methodist Church Ghana, Mfantsipim is widely regarded as the cradle of formal secondary education in the country.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Focus</h2>



<p>The anniversary, on the theme: “A legacy of excellence, leadership and service to inspire the future,” will be anchored on five strategic pillars.</p>



<p>They are &#8211; celebrating the school’s heritage, strengthening academic delivery, improving infrastructure, deepening alumni and community engagement, and contributing meaningfully to national education development.</p>



<p>The committee, which was inaugurated in August 2024, had constituted sub-committees to drive implementation of the programmes in collaboration with stakeholders.</p>



<p>They include the Methodist Church Ghana, the Ministry of Education and the Mfantsipim Old Boys Association (MOBA).</p>



<p>Mr Yamoah mentioned key legacy projects earmarked under the reform agenda to include the upgrading of academic and residential facilities, expansion of STEM and digital learning infrastructure, enhancement of sports facilities, the establishment of a historical museum to preserve the school’s archives, and the erection of a 150th anniversary monument.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Activities</h2>



<p>The anniversary year, which will run until December 2026, will feature significant events which would include an official launch scheduled for April 11, 2026, in Accra, followed by a series of educational, cultural and community engagements across the country.</p>



<p>“The success of Mfantsipim@150 depends on all of us; MOBA, staff of Mfantsipim, students, parents, the Methodist Church Ghana, corporate partners, traditional authorities, and the people of Cape Coast and of Ghana.</p>



<p>“Together, let us honour the past, celebrate the present, and secure the future of this great institution by investing in it,” Mr Yamoah said.</p>



<p>He warned that any unauthorised reproduction or commercial exploitation of the trademarked logo or memorabilia would attract legal sanctions.</p>



<p>A representative of the Methodist Church, Rt Rev. Emmanuel Borlabi Bortey, said mission schools were established not merely for literacy but for moral and spiritual transformation.</p>



<p>He said that education was central to spreading the Gospel and building integrity-driven societies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Significance</h2>



<p>The Director-General of the Ghana Education Service, Professor Ernest Kofi Davis, described the anniversary as a platform to assess and advance secondary education nationally.</p>



<p>Using Mfantsipim as a benchmark, he said GES would strengthen STEM, digital learning, teacher development and access to quality education, and ensure that such standards were replicated across the country to meet 21st-century demands.</p>



<p>For his part, the Headmaster of the school, Very Rev. Ebenezer K. Aidoo, described the anniversary as a celebration, a call to action, and an investment in the future.</p>



<p>He urged alumni to mobilise resources, strengthen networks and influence to strengthen infrastructure, digital learning and holistic education, among other initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana’s second group game at the World Cup against England could be cancelled due to an escalating funding dispute surrounding the stadium scheduled to host the match.</p>



<p>FIFA is facing the alarming prospect of relocating seven matches away from Gillette Stadium, barely four months before the tournament begins per UK newspaper, The Mirror.</p>



<p>The venue which serves as home to the New England Patriots and New England Revolution is slated to host several World Cup fixtures, including the Ghana vs England encounter.</p>



<p>Scotland’s first two World Cup matches against Haiti and Morocco, are also scheduled to be played there, as well as Norway’s clash with France and a fixture involving one of Bolivia, Iraq or Suriname. The stadium is additionally due to host a Round of 32 match and a quarter-final.</p>



<p>However, the town of Foxborough is threatening not to grant the necessary entertainment licence unless its security costs are guaranteed in advance.</p>



<p>Although the stadium forms part of the Boston metropolitan area, approximately 22 miles south-west of the city, FIFA’s sponsorship regulations mean it will be officially referred to as “Boston Stadium” during the tournament.</p>



<p>The dispute came into sharp focus during a town meeting on Tuesday night between members of the Foxborough Select Board and FIFA representatives.</p>



<p>Director of venue operations Kevin Clark and Boston 2026 host committee president Mike Loynd were questioned by board members.</p>



<p>Board chair Bill Yukna asked Loynd:<br>“Is FIFA, who is going to be the licensee, are they in the end responsible if nothing else comes through on this?”</p>



<p>Loynd replied: &#8220;That&#8217;s sort of a broad question.”</p>



<p>Board member Mark Elfman responded: “It&#8217;s really not.”</p>



<p>Elfman added as quoted by the Mirror: “I gotta be honest with you, it baffles my mind that you guys are sitting here in front of me right now and how we still have no idea where this money&#8217;s coming from.”</p>



<p>At the centre of the disagreement is an estimated $7.8 million in security funding.</p>



<p>Foxborough officials insist the amount must be guaranteed upfront, making it clear they will not risk taxpayers’ money on the promise of reimbursement.</p>



<p>Vice chair Stephanie McGowan stated firmly:<br>“We&#8217;re not prepared to issue this license unless everything is in place. I&#8217;m gonna tell you, this board will not issue this license.”</p>



<p>She further questioned: &#8220;How does anybody expect that we would do this for someone who&#8217;s coming into our town for 39 days, making all these demands, and then you guys are gonna go away. Then once there is no Boston26 … well, who are we gonna sue?”</p>



<p>Despite the hardline position, Yukna indicated that a resolution remains possible.</p>



<p>&#8220;We want nothing more than to be able to just sign on the dotted line and know that when the events start, our problems aren&#8217;t about the money.”</p>



<p>Ghana is Group L and will play England on June 23, 2026, in Boston.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Government has released GH¢855 million to settle arrears owed to cocoa farmers after a prolonged payment crisis that left many producers unpaid for months, despite delivering their produce to licensed buying companies.</p>



<p>The payment is part of an emergency intervention to stabilise the cocoa sector and restore confidence among farmers and buying companies. </p>



<p>In the wake of the crisis, the government has also announced a broad package of reforms aimed at restructuring the industry and putting the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) on a more sustainable financial footing. </p>



<p>These reforms include a controversial reduction of more than GH¢1,000 in the producer price per bag, a move that has sparked debate across the sector.</p>



<p>Speaking to journalists in Parliament of Ghana, Chairman of the Finance Committee, Isaac Adongo, defended the measures, describing them as difficult but necessary steps to rescue a sector he said has been under severe financial strain for years.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ADONGO-855.mp3.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>“The bottom line of all that has happened is that some amounts were owed to cocoa farmers, and the government took a decision to repay those monies so that the cocoa buying companies can settle the outstanding obligations,” he said.</p>



<p>“I’m happy to report that this morning, the government has released 855 million cedis for that purpose. But we have also decided to introduce a number of reforms that are long overdue. </p>



<p>&#8220;The cocoa sector has been under enormous strain over the years, and we have been pretending to service cocoa farmers while destroying the very vehicle we use to support them.”</p>



<p>Mr Adongo also blamed the crisis on the previous New Patriotic Party (NPP) administration, rejecting claims that responsibility lies with the current government. </p>



<p>According to him, COCOBOD entered 2025 heavily indebted and financially distressed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ADONGO-RECKLESS.mp3.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>“COCOBOD entered 2025 with about GH¢17.8 billion in loans, plus significant operational liabilities. When you add everything together, the exposure was over GH¢60 billion. That vehicle could not be sustainable and had to be addressed,” he said.</p>



<p>“You have 60 billion of somebody’s money, it’s not free money. You are not paying, and yet you are saying we should continue to go and borrow more.”</p>



<p>He maintained that the release of funds to farmers, coupled with structural reforms in pricing, financing and operations, is intended to stabilise the sector, protect farmers in the long term, and rebuild COCOBOD into a financially viable institution capable of sustaining Ghana’s cocoa economy.</p>

<p>Former Defence Minister and Bimbilla Member of Parliament Dominic Nitiwul has called on the government to provide a full explanation regarding recent developments affecting Ghanaian nationals abroad, emphasising the urgent need for a fully empowered Defence Minister to oversee investigations.</p>



<p>Mr Nitiwul’s comments come in the wake of a recent terrorist attack in Burkina Faso that targeted Ghanaian tomato traders, raising concerns about the safety of Ghanaian nationals operating in volatile regions of West Africa.</p>



<p>Eight Ghanaians were killed, and several others were injured in the deadly attack.</p>



<p>Speaking to the press, Mr Nitiwul expressed concern over what he described as insufficient information from government authorities. </p>



<p>“I just think that the Ghanaian government must be explaining to us what happened, the circumstances. I think the government has not yet come out,” he said. “They’ve come out officially with some statement, but we want a detailed explanation, either by the foreign minister or by the defence minister.&#8221;</p>



<p>He further stressed the importance of having a defence minister in place to coordinate Ghana’s response in times of crisis.</p>

</ul>



<p>“And that’s why I kept on calling that the President should have appointed a Defence Minister, because by this time the Minister for Defence should have been on the flight to Burkina Faso with his team,” Mr Nitiwul said.</p>



<p>The former minister highlighted that a defence minister with a full mandate is critical not only for leading investigations but also for ensuring timely government action and coordination with security agencies abroad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman of Parliament’s Finance Committee, Isaac Adongo, has announced that the Ministry of Roads and Highways will take over road construction projects previously managed by the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), citing mismanagement and unsustainable financial commitments.</p>



<p>Addressing a press briefing on the cocoa sector and related infrastructure challenges, the Bolgatanga Central MP disclosed that COCOBOD entered 2025 with more than GH¢26.5 billion in outstanding road commitments. Of this amount, only GH¢4.4 billion has been certified, rationalised and transferred to the Roads Ministry for implementation.</p>



<p>He stressed that road construction falls outside COCOBOD’s core mandate, particularly at a time when the board is facing significant financial strain.</p>



<p>“It is time for us to wash our hands off cocoa roads and get the appropriate ministry — the Ministry of Roads and Highways — to take over the construction of roads,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Adongo further revealed that between 2017 and 2020, COCOBOD undertook road projects without board approval. He said contracts worth GH¢1.4 billion were awarded in 2017, GH¢14 billion in 2018–2019, and GH¢5.8 billion during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite no allocations being approved for such works.</p>



<p>“The end result is that we are now saddled with about GH¢26.6 billion in road commitments at COCOBOD. Certainly, this cannot continue,” he stated.</p>



<p>He also raised concerns about the management of loans from the African Development Bank. According to him, COCOBOD accessed a GH¢600 million facility, of which GH¢250 million was not released by the bank. He added that the remaining GH¢350 million, intended to boost cocoa production, failed to achieve its objective, as cocoa output declined.</p>



<p>Mr Adongo maintained that transferring the road projects to the Roads Ministry would rationalise spending and allow COCOBOD to concentrate on its core responsibility of improving cocoa production.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, Vincent Ekow Assafuah, has petitioned the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) to investigate what he describes as serious concerns of conflict of interest, abuse of office, and administrative malpractice at the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD)]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, Vincent Ekow Assafuah, has petitioned the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) to investigate what he describes as serious concerns of conflict of interest, abuse of office, and administrative malpractice at the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD)</p>



<p>A formal petition was submitted to the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) today, Thursday, February 19, calling for a full-scale investigation into the issues.</p>



<p>The petition, grounded in Article 218(a) of the 1992 Constitution and Section 7(1)(a) of the CHRAJ Act, 1993 (Act 456), raises concerns about the conduct of Mr. Ato Boateng, Acting Deputy Chief Executive in charge of Finance and Administration at COCOBOD.</p>



<p><strong>Alleged Prior Ties to Private Company</strong></p>



<p>According to the petitioner, publicly available records and professional profiles indicate that Mr. Boateng previously served as Chief Executive Officer of Atlas Commodities Limited in 2018. The company is engaged in cocoa-related commercial activities.</p>



<p>The petitioner argues that this prior executive and fiduciary relationship raises red flags, particularly given Mr. Boateng’s current strategic role at COCOBOD, where he is said to wield significant influence over financial approvals, administrative control, regulatory oversight and institutional decision-making affecting Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs) and other cocoa sector operators.</p>



<p><strong>Warehouse Operations Under Scrutiny</strong></p>



<p>A key issue highlighted in the petition concerns the operations of Atlas Commodities Limited within warehouses registered under the Produce Buying Company (PBC).</p>



<p>Under COCOBOD regulations, warehouses are required to be registered under and used exclusively by specific Licensed Buying Companies. Such facilities are not to be used for the storage, grading, sealing or processing of cocoa belonging to other companies.</p>



<p>The petition contends that Atlas Commodities’ operations within PBC-registered warehouses raise serious regulatory and governance concerns, especially in light of Mr. Boateng’s previous leadership role at the company and his current senior management position at COCOBOD.</p>



<p><strong>Constitutional and Legal Basis</strong></p>



<p>The petitioner cites Article 284 of the 1992 Constitution, which states that a public officer must not place himself in a position where his personal interest conflicts or is likely to conflict with the performance of his official duties.</p>



<p>The petition also references the Public Office Holders (Declaration of Assets and Disqualification) Act, 1998 (Act 550), which prohibits public officers from engaging in conduct that creates a conflict between private interests and official responsibilities.</p>



<p>Additionally, Section 7(1)(a) of the CHRAJ Act empowers the Commission to investigate alleged corruption, abuse of power, unfair treatment and administrative injustice involving public officers.</p>



<p><strong>Key Issues for Investigation</strong></p>



<p>The petitioner is urging CHRAJ to investigate:</p>



<p>-Whether Mr. Boateng’s prior executive role at Atlas Commodities constitutes a conflict of interest under Article 284 of the Constitution.</p>



<p>-Whether full disclosure of his past association with the company was made to COCOBOD and relevant state oversight bodies upon his appointment.</p>



<p>-Whether Atlas Commodities has received any preferential treatment, regulatory accommodation or operational advantage within COCOBOD-regulated systems.</p>



<p>-Whether the use of PBC-registered warehouses by the company violates COCOBOD regulations and whether any official facilitation enabled such operations.</p>



<p>-Whether the circumstances amount to abuse of office, regulatory capture or administrative malpractice.</p>



<p><strong>Reliefs Being Sought</strong></p>



<p>The petition is requesting CHRAJ to conduct a full, independent and transparent investigation into the allegations; determine whether any constitutional, statutory or administrative breaches have occurred; and recommend appropriate sanctions or institutional reforms where necessary.</p>



<p>It further calls for corrective administrative measures to safeguard the integrity of COCOBOD’s regulatory and operational systems.</p>



<p>Describing the cocoa industry as one of Ghana’s most strategic economic pillars, the petitioner stresses that the integrity and impartiality of COCOBOD’s governance structures are of paramount national importance.</p>



<p>The petition concludes that any situation that reasonably gives rise to conflict-of-interest concerns must be addressed decisively to preserve public trust, institutional credibility and regulatory fairness.</p>



<p>CHRAJ is yet to publicly comment on the petition.</p>

<p>The Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) has intercepted 12 articulated trucks in a major enforcement operation along the Dawhenya–Tema Road, in what officials describe as a serious breach of Ghana’s transit regime with significant revenue implications.</p>



<p>The operation, conducted between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m., was led by the Deputy Commissioner, Operations, with support from the Chief Revenue Officer, Preventive (Tema Collection), the Revenue Mobilisation Taskforce of National Security, and enforcement officers from both the Tema Collection and Customs Headquarters.</p>



<p>The 12 trucks are believed to be part of a consignment of 18 articulated trucks that had been electronically gated out of the Customs system as transit goods.</p>



<p>They were declared as goods in transit from Akanu, destined for Niger through Kulungugu. However, the trucks were intercepted while moving without the mandatory Customs human escort, a major breach of transit procedures.</p>



<p>The trucks were loaded with 44,055 packages of edible cooking oil, tomato paste and spaghetti. Authorities say the actual value of taxes involved is over GH¢85 million.</p>



<p>Eleven of the intercepted trucks have been moved to the GPHA Transit Terminal and are under strict Customs supervision, with logistical support from the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority.</p>

<p>One truck developed a mechanical fault during the operation, and its contents are being transferred to another vehicle to secure the goods.</p>



<p>Preliminary checks confirm that all 18 trucks were electronically gated out of the system, yet only 12 have been physically secured.</p>



<p>Investigations are ongoing to identify and track the six outstanding trucks.</p>



<p>Deputy Minister for Finance, Thomas Nyarko Ampem, congratulated the team for the bust and explained that explained that “Investigation is ongoing to identify the six outstanding trucks.”</p>



<p>He disclosed that he has directed the Commissioner-General to conclude investigations within one week.</p>



<p>“I’ve asked the Commissioner-General to conclude investigations in one week. We are tracking the two Customs officers who were involved,” he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Ampem stressed the seriousness of the matter, noting that the potential revenue loss is substantial.</p>



<p>“We take these things seriously because the impact on our revenue is serious,” he added.</p>



<p>On his part, the Commissioner-General of the Ghana Revenue Authority, Anthony Kwasi Sarpong, cautioned businesses and traders to comply fully with Customs laws.</p>



<p>He warned that authorities would not hesitate to apply the full rigours of the law against offenders.</p>



<p>“We will apply the law of confiscation. The full arms of the law will be applied,” he said, adding that the GRA would crack the whip on any business or individual found culpable of actions that deny the state much-needed revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Chamber of Oil Marketing Companies (COMAC) and the Chamber of Bulk Oil Distributors (CBOD) have condemned the alleged diversion of funds from the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Fund to the Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing Company (GCMC), describing the move as a “flagrant breach of statutory mandate” and a “dangerous sabotage of national energy policy.”</p>



<p>The LPG Fund, implemented by the National Petroleum Authority (NPA) on April 1, 2024, under Legislative Instruments LI 2262 (amended) and LI 2481, was established with three legally binding objectives:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>USD 44/MT Bottling Plant Margin</strong> – To finance the construction and operation of LPG bottling plants nationwide.</li>



<li><strong>USD 36/MT Cylinder Investment Margin</strong> – To fund the Cylinder Recirculation Model (CRM) for safe and efficient LPG distribution.</li>
</ol>



<p>The press release emphasised that the fund’s purposes are non-negotiable and were never intended as discretionary capital for ad hoc allocations. </p>



<p>Redirecting resources to GCMC, according to COMAC and CBOD, represents not administrative flexibility but a direct breach of law that undermines the LPG safety and infrastructure framework.</p>



<p>The chambers argued that diverting the fund away from bottling plant development, CRM rollout, and the withdrawal of unsafe cylinders endangers lives. </p>



<p>“Government is actively choosing GCMC’s financial convenience over the holistic mission to increase LPG accessibility, remove lethal cylinders from circulation, and ensure safe replacement,” the statement read.</p>



<div data-wp-interactive="core/file" class="wp-block-file"><object data-wp-bind--hidden="!state.hasPdfPreview" hidden class="wp-block-file__embed" data="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PRESS-RELEASE-1.pdf" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%;height:600px" aria-label="Embed of PRESS RELEASE (1)."></object><a id="wp-block-file--media-34221074-479f-4dc5-a676-1c9b3d3ddb69" href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PRESS-RELEASE-1.pdf">PRESS RELEASE (1)</a><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PRESS-RELEASE-1.pdf" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-34221074-479f-4dc5-a676-1c9b3d3ddb69" download>Download</a></div>



<p>Beyond the immediate energy sector, the alleged diversion carries wider economic consequences:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Destruction of private investment</strong> – Operators who invested billions based on statutory assurances face potential collapse.</li>



<li><strong>Job losses</strong> – Thousands of livelihoods along the LPG value chain are threatened.</li>



<li><strong>Consumer exploitation</strong> – Households may bear the burden through higher prices, reduced supply, and continued safety risks.</li>



<li><strong>Investor flight</strong> – Both domestic and foreign investors may withdraw from a jurisdiction where statutory guarantees are not respected.</li>
</ul>



<p>The chambers warned that “every diverted cedi erodes competitiveness, freezes critical investment, and transfers wealth from productive enterprise to governmental discretion,” undermining public confidence in state institutions.</p>



<p>COMAC and CBOD outlined clear, non-negotiable corrective measures:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cease all disbursements</strong> to GCMC from the LPG Fund immediately.</li>



<li><strong>Reverse any allocations</strong> already made and restore funds to their lawful purpose.</li>



<li><strong>Reaffirm statutory mandate</strong> – Ensure the fund finances only bottling plants, CRM rollout, and unsafe cylinder withdrawal.</li>



<li><strong>Guarantee transparency</strong> – Implement quarterly public reporting on all fund utilisation with independent audit verification.</li>
</ol>



<p>“These are not industry requests. These are legal and moral imperatives,” the statement stressed.</p>



<p>The chambers a pointed message to authorities: the government must now decide whether to uphold the rule of law, protect its citizens, and maintain energy sector credibility, or to condone misallocation and bureaucratic convenience at the expense of safety and public trust.</p>



<p>COMAC and CBOD pledged to pursue all legitimate avenues—policy, legal, and public—to defend the LPG Fund’s rightful utilisation. </p>



<p>“We will not permit this fund to become a discretionary slush account. We will not remain passive while statutory protections are shredded. We will not accept anything less than full accountability, decisive leadership, and restoration of fund integrity,” the statement concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman of the Finance Committee of Parliament, Isaac Adongo, has disclosed that the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) began 2025 burdened with approximately GH¢17.8 billion in loans and additional operational liabilities, warning that the institution was facing severe financial distress.</p>



<p>Addressing a press briefing on the current cocoa sector crisis, the Bolgatanga Central MP said the scale of COCOBOD’s debt exposure had become unsustainable and required urgent intervention.</p>



<p>“COCOBOD entered 2025 with roughly GH¢17.8 billion in loans plus operational liabilities. So loans alone were about GH¢17.8 billion by the beginning of 2025.</p>



<p>“If you add this to other obligations, you will soon come to realise that at this point, COCOBOD was bleeding with an exposure of about GH¢60 billion,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Adongo argued that the situation made continued borrowing imprudent, stressing that the cocoa sector could not remain viable under such heavy debt.</p>



<p>“Certainly, that vehicle could not be sustainable and needed to be addressed,” he noted.</p>



<p>To illustrate his point, the MP used a metaphor, questioning the logic of accumulating more debt without fixing underlying inefficiencies.</p>



<p>“If you have a basket in which you put water to drink and the bucket is leaking, do you fix the leak before you put water inside, or do you continue to put the water inside hoping that some will be left for you to drink?” he asked.</p>



<p>Adongo criticised those he said were advising government to take on additional borrowing despite the existing liabilities, describing such arguments as &#8220;illogical&#8221;.</p>



<p>“You have GH¢60 billion of somebody’s money. It’s not free money. You are not paying, and you are saying that we should continue even to go and borrow more,” he said.</p>



<p>He maintained that the cocoa sector requires a reset, insisting that government must confront the financial realities rather than deepen COCOBOD’s debt burden.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Police in South Africa have detained the youngest son of Zimbabwe&#8217;s late former President Robert Mugabe after a reported shooting at a property in an upmarket suburb in Johannesburg.</p>



<p>Bellarmine Mugabe, thought to be in his late 20s, was taken into custody following allegations that a 23-year-old man, believed to be a gardener, was shot.</p>



<p>Police are currently at the house in Hyde Park, where Mugabe was staying, and are searching for a firearm in what they are describing as a case of attempted murder.</p>



<p>Bellarmine Mugabe is the youngest son of Robert and his second wife Grace Mugabe. Robert Mugabe, who died in 2019, led Zimbabwe for 37 years before being forced out of power at the age of 93 in 2017.</p>



<p>Two people have been detained for questioning as the South African police determine the circumstances of the shooting, police spokesperson Col Dimakatso Nevhuhulwi told the BBC.</p>



<p>Police are not yet officially naming Bellarmine Mugabe as one of those being held, but reporters at the scene saw him in handcuffs and he has been widely named by local media.</p>



<p>The victim is in hospital and in a critical condition, the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>The government has announced plans to rename the National Investigations Bureau (NIB) as the Bureau of National Intelligence (BNI) as part of proposed reforms contained in the Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025.</p>



<p>The Interior Minister, Mohammed Mubarak Muntaka, told Parliament on Thursday, 19 January, that the change is intended to eliminate persistent confusion surrounding the NIB acronym, which is frequently mistaken for the National Investment Bank.</p>



<p>Addressing Members of Parliament on the floor of the House, the Minister argued that the overlap undermines clarity within the country’s security framework and runs counter to global practice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Everywhere in the world, you make sure that the acronyms for the security agencies do not match anything else, and in fact, it is supported by law to make sure that nobody can name anything after an acronym of any of the security agencies,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, we have a situation where, when you say NIB, people are wondering whether you&#8217;re talking about the bank or you&#8217;re talking about the security agency. So Mister Speaker, one of the significant things that we are trying to do is to reintroduce the name BNI at this time. Even though the BNI of yesterday was the Bureau of National Investigation, this BNI will remain the Bureau of National Intelligence.&#8221;</p>



<p>The proposed rebranding forms part of broader institutional adjustments aimed at restructuring Ghana’s security architecture. Beyond the name change, the bill also seeks to abolish the specific portfolio of the Minister for National Security.</p>



<p>Under the new arrangement, the President would be empowered to designate a Minister to exercise oversight over the National Security Coordinator, rather than maintaining a standalone ministry.</p>



<p>Explaining the rationale, Mr Muntaka said the reforms are designed to prevent operational friction and role duplication within the security establishment.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;A detailed ministerial role and the function of the national security coordinator, because he&#8217;s supposed to coordinate all the activities within the space. And if you assign or leave a ministry called the Ministry of National Security, which is likely supposed to play an oversight role, and if you are not careful, they begin to conflate, and they begin to have misunderstandings, and that affects the security architecture that we have in the country.</p>



<p>&#8220;So one of the things that we are trying to do is to keep this position as more or less that of the President, and then he gets one of his ministers to play that oversight without the necessarily fine, detailed designation of a minister for national security, so that as much as possible you try to avoid the conflict between the minister and the National Security coordinator&#8221;.</p>



<p>However, the Minority Leader, Alexander Afenyo-Markin, has mounted strong opposition to the Bill, cautioning that it risks concentrating excessive authority in the hands of the National Security Coordinator.</p>



<p>He questioned the necessity of the reforms, arguing that the memorandum accompanying the Bill fails to demonstrate shortcomings in the existing legal framework.</p>



<p>He said, &#8220;The memorandum before us does not provide any empirical evidence to suggest that ACT 1030 has failed. It appears that this bill is more founded on partisan political interest than a national security interest for good governance.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is being proposed? So much power is being given to the coordinator; it is not clear how his powers are going to be fettered, Mr Speaker. My submission is that if you give such powers to the coordinator, and you do not provide for a clear path of responsibility, accountability, and oversight, it becomes problematic to you yourself as a government, and when the rights of citizens are being abused, the man will come and tell you that in the name of national security. There will be the need for the Minister to sit with us as a house, do further winnowing, and incorporate the major concerns raised by the minority on this floor.&#8221;</p>



<p>The debate signals the likelihood of intense scrutiny as Parliament considers the Bill, with questions centering on accountability, oversight, and the balance of power within the national security framework.</p>

<p>The Ghana Tertiary Education Council (GTEC) has ordered the immediate closure of Royal Nursing College in Tafo Nyhiaeso, Ashanti Region, citing the institution’s failure to provide documentation verifying its accreditation.</p>



<p>GTEC stated that the college does not hold accreditation from the Nursing and Midwifery Council and had ignored a previous directive issued in June 2024, which prohibited the admission of new students.</p>



<p>The college, reportedly enrolling over 800 students, has been operating without proper registration, raising serious concerns about programme management and the quality of education being offered.</p>



<p>According to Accra-based Citi News, GTEC officials visited the campus on Thursday, February 19, and after an inspection lasting about an hour, announced the closure.</p>



<p>The Council emphasized that the measure was necessary to protect students and enforce national education standards.</p>



<p>Plans are being made to transfer affected students to accredited institutions, with special arrangements expected for final-year students to complete their programmes.</p>



<p>The closure left many students distraught, with some reportedly in tears on campus. Several expressed frustration, noting that they had recently paid tuition fees only to face an abrupt disruption to their studies.</p>



<p>During the enforcement visit, the Criminal Investigation Department accompanied GTEC officials, taking into custody the wife of the school’s owner and certain members of the college’s management team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A bill to allow persons with dual citizenship to hold public office, laid in parliament for consideration, has reopened a debate that strikes at the very heart of sovereignty, loyalty, and institutional maturity. This conversation must be had, but it must be had wisely.</p>



<p>Ghana is not hostile to dual citizenship. Far from it. Dual nationality has long been part of our national fabric, and it has brought immense value. Ghanaians living abroad and those who hold additional passports have returned with global exposure, technical expertise, investment capital, and administrative competence to support national development across sectors  from finance and health to diplomacy, technology, and public administration</p>



<p> But, of all the countries in the world, Ghana is part of the 49% that allows dual citizenship. With that said, some of these countries have limits to what a dual citizen can become in their country. Those without the limits have strict naturalisation laws and requirements. Ghana falls within those with limits on what one can become.</p>



<p>Our history proves this openness.</p>



<p>We witnessed this prominently under the administration of John Agyekum Kufuor and more recently during the tenure of Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo. No one has ever stopped capable Ghanaians with other nationalities from contributing to national development.</p>



<p>Some dual citizens served in high-level government roles as advisors and heads of state institutions. Ghana has never blocked its global citizens from contributing. I am confident there are dual citizenship holders currently serving in John Mahama’s administration.</p>



<p>And it should never stop. However, openness does not mean recklessness. In every serious state, there are lines drawn around sovereign-sensitive offices.</p>



<p><strong>What the Ghanaian Constitution Already Protects</strong></p>



<p>The framers of our democracy understood something timeless: allegiance must never be divided at the very top of state power. That is why the Constitution of the Republic of Ghana, 1992 provides explicit safeguards.</p>



<p>The Presidency — Article 62(1)(a) “A person shall not be qualified for election as President of Ghana unless he is a citizen of Ghana by birth.” Because the Commander-in-Chief must have only one unquestionable loyalty Ghana.<br>Parliament -Article 94(2)(a)</p>



<p>“A person shall not be qualified to be a Member of Parliament if he owes allegiance to a country other than Ghana.” Any allegiance elsewhere disqualifies you. Ghana’s constitutional architecture is not accidental. It is deliberate.</p>



<p>These two clauses alone reveal the spirit of Ghana’s constitutional thinking&nbsp;:<br>Leadership at the heart of state power demands exclusive national loyalty. And it is within this same spirit that other highly sensitive offices exist under constitutional authority, including:</p>



<p><strong>Chief of Defence Staff &amp; Service Chiefs</strong></p>



<p>Inspector General of Police<br>Ambassadors &amp; High Commissioners<br>Secretary to the Cabinet (executive authority under the Presidency)<br>While the Constitution appoints these roles through executive power, their nature is inseparable from national security, diplomacy, and sovereignty. No serious state treats them casually.</p>



<p><strong>Dual Citizenship Has Always Served Ghana With Limits</strong></p>



<p>Let us be clear and fair. Dual citizenship is not the enemy. It has strengthened Ghana. Our diaspora has powered investment, strengthened institutions, improved governance practices, and elevated Ghana’s global profile. In business, medicine, academia, development work, technology, and even government administration, dual citizens have played transformative roles.</p>



<p>Restrictions on a few sensitive offices do not erase this contribution. They simply protect the core of the state. And that protection is both reasonable and patriotic.</p>



<p><strong>Why Comparing Ghana to Europe Is Misleading</strong></p>



<p>Some argue that Europe and other advanced democracies allow dual citizens to hold high public office  so Ghana should follow. But this comparison ignores a fundamental truth: Europe’s political stability rests on centuries of strong institutions, deep-rooted accountability systems, independent justice structures, and mature anti-corruption safeguards. </p>



<p>Ghana is still building hers. This is not an insult to our democracy  it is honesty.</p>



<p>Until our institutions are strong enough to manage conflicts of interest swiftly, enforce accountability without fear or favour, and secure the state against sophisticated political and financial misconduct, divided allegiance at the highest levels of power is a risk we cannot afford.</p>



<p><strong>Accountability, Extradition, and National Security</strong></p>



<p>There is also the uncomfortable but necessary question of enforcement. What happens when a dual citizen occupying a sensitive office compromises Ghana’s national interest and escapes to their second country, especially one without an extradition agreement? How does Ghana compel justice? Even those with an extradition agreement, the host country can decline Ghana’s request.</p>



<p>Sovereignty without enforceable accountability becomes ceremonial. The higher the office, the greater the risk  and the greater the need for exclusive national loyalty.</p>



<p><strong>The Global Reality: Many Countries Draw the Same Lines</strong></p>



<p>Across the world, states quietly acknowledge that dual allegiance becomes dangerous at the highest levels of power. For example:</p>



<p>The United States restricts its presidency to citizens by birth and limits sensitive security clearances. Japan requires renunciation of other citizenships for naturalisation. The Netherlands generally withdraws citizenship when another is acquired. </p>



<p>Singapore and China do not recognise dual citizenship.</p>



<p>Several African states, including Rwanda and Kenya, allow dual nationality but restrict access to certain sensitive public offices. Even where dual citizenship exists, limitations almost always follow. Why? Because nations understand that loyalty cannot be split when sovereignty is at stake.</p>



<p>Citizenship, Conflict, and National Interest<br>Dual citizens swear allegiance to two sovereign states. In moments of diplomatic tension, military conflict, economic sanctions, or strategic negotiations where interests clash, no statute can regulate the human instinct of loyalty. History teaches that when national interests collide, divided allegiance becomes a vulnerability. This is precisely why sensitive offices across the world remain guarded.</p>



<p><strong>Public Office Is Service, Not Convenience</strong></p>



<p>Serving in Ghana’s highest offices is not an entitlement. It is a sacred trust. Anyone who seeks to lead Ghana at the pinnacle of state power must be willing to hold one allegiance to Ghana alone. If one cannot relinquish other nationalities for the honour of such service, that choice is valid, but leadership at that level must then belong to those whose loyalty is undivided. That is not discrimination. That is patriotism.</p>



<p>A Wise Balance for a Developing Democracy</p>



<p>This balance has served us well. To dismantle it prematurely in the name of modernity would be to trade caution for risk. Perhaps in the future, when institutions are exceptionally strong, corruption safeguards airtight, accountability swift, and national security systems fully resilient, this debate can be reopened. But today, wisdom must prevail over haste.</p>



<p>Dual citizenship has always been part of Ghana’s progress story, and it should remain so. But safeguarding the highest offices of the state is not backwardness. It is responsible governance. Restrictions on sensitive national positions are fair.</p>



<p>They are prudent and patriotic. A nation that fails to protect the core of its sovereignty eventually loses control of its destiny. Ghana must remain open  but never naïve. One country. One sovereignty. One undivided allegiance at the helm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Private legal practitioner Justice Abdulai has declared his support for the removal of the Electoral Commission (EC) Chairperson, Jean Mensa, and her deputies, describing such a move as necessary for Ghana’s democratic progress.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on Joy FM’s Midday News on Thursday, 19 February, he acknowledged holding a personal bias against the EC Chair, stating that he has not been impressed with her performance, particularly in the last two general elections.</p>



<p>“I have to be honest about my position on the EC Chair in particular — I am biased against her removal. Any petition legitimately intended for her removal, I’ll be in support of it,” he said.</p>



<p>He argued that the removal of the EC leadership would be a “good omen” for Ghana, stressing that the Commission’s work in recent years has left much to be desired.</p>



<p>“I needed her out because I’m not impressed with her work, particularly since the last two elections,” he added.</p>



<p>His comments follow the decision by Chief Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie to dismiss petitions seeking the removal of the EC Chair, her deputies, and the Special Prosecutor, on the grounds that the complaints failed to meet the prima facie threshold required under Article 146 of the Constitution.</p>



<p>However, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) has insisted that the Electoral Commission’s leadership must be removed.</p>



<p>While agreeing that the Chief Justice’s ruling must be respected, the lawyer raised concerns about the discretionary power vested in the Chief Justice in determining whether a prima facie case has been established.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DN_ZCmXbDIw?si=ixxc0E4sebSFlJR6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>He warned that such discretion could turn the removal process into a political tool, depending on how public office holders “appeal” to the relevant authorities.</p>



<p>“It becomes a serious political tool for the removal of these public office holders, depending on whether the person appeals appropriately to the President or the Chief Justice,” he cautioned.</p>



<p>He renewed calls for reforms to Article 146, advocating legislative measures to regulate the removal of Article 71 office holders, including senior judicial and electoral officials.</p>



<p>He also welcomed similar proposals by Minority MP Nana Agyei Baffour Awuah, who has called for a Constitutional Instrument (CI) to guide the process.</p>



<p>“I had already made that proposal,” he said. “It is in the right direction, and we have to have this done.”</p>

<p><br>The Chief Executive Officer of <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0">Chartman Herbal Center</a>, <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1">Dr Charity Twumasi Ankrah</a>, has advised women to prioritise personal care after childbirth, warning that neglecting hygiene and health could affect intimacy in marriage.</p>



<p>She made the remarks during a discussion on the Let’s Talk show on <strong>Joy Prime</strong>, where a married man’s loss of interest in sex with his wife due to vaginal odour sparked the conversation.</p>



<p>According to Dr Ankrah, many women tend to pay more attention to their children after birth and forget to care for themselves. She stressed the importance of self-development, saying, “Hygienically, mentally, spiritually, physically, healthwise, you have to work on yourself.”</p>



<p>She explained that vaginal odour could be caused by postpartum bleeding that is not cleaned properly, infections and hormonal changes.</p>



<p>Dr Ankrah also cautioned women against using certain products to tighten or clean the vagina. She said, “When you begin to drink these things and begin to insert these things, you automatically eliminate all these good bacteria that protect the vagina.”</p>



<p>She added that the vagina is designed to open and close naturally, and encouraged women to understand their bodies in order to detect any changes early. “Know your bodies, know your scent,” she advised.</p>



<p>Dr Ankrah further offered support to women dealing with such conditions, saying, “I would love to treat it.” She also recommended healthy eating, including fruits and vegetables, and drinking enough water to help balance hormones and improve overall health.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Civil and Local Government Staff Association of Ghana (CLOGSAG) has announced plans for an industrial action following what it described as government inaction on the implementation of a unique salary structure and improved conditions of service for civil and local government staff.</p>



<p>In a press statement released on Thursday, February 19, 2026, the National Executive Council (NEC) of CLOGSAG outlined the protracted history of negotiations on the issue, which began in 2019 and culminated in the signing of two separate Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WhatsApp-Video-2026-02-19-at-12.52.09-PM.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Despite repeated reminders to the Ministry of Labour, Jobs and Employment and the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission (FWSC), the NEC noted that the government has failed to respond or implement the agreed measures, which were to take effect from January 1, 2025.</p>



<div data-wp-interactive="core/file" class="wp-block-file"><object data-wp-bind--hidden="!state.hasPdfPreview" hidden class="wp-block-file__embed" data="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PRESS-STATEMENT-DELAY-IN-THE-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-UNIQUE-SALARY-STRUCTURE-19TH-FEB.-2026-2.pdf" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%;height:600px" aria-label="Embed of PRESS STATEMENT - DELAY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIQUE SALARY STRUCTURE 19TH FEB. 2026 (2)."></object><a id="wp-block-file--media-57afc29c-d81f-4dcd-a230-f4aa883fd87d" href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PRESS-STATEMENT-DELAY-IN-THE-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-UNIQUE-SALARY-STRUCTURE-19TH-FEB.-2026-2.pdf">PRESS STATEMENT &#8211; DELAY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIQUE SALARY STRUCTURE 19TH FEB. 2026 (2)</a><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PRESS-STATEMENT-DELAY-IN-THE-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-UNIQUE-SALARY-STRUCTURE-19TH-FEB.-2026-2.pdf" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-57afc29c-d81f-4dcd-a230-f4aa883fd87d" download>Download</a></div>



<p>The NEC expressed concern that staff of the Civil Service and Local Government Service are being “taken for granted” as a result of the government’s failure to honour its commitments. </p>



<p>In response, the council has declared industrial action to press for the demands of its members.</p>



<p>CLOGSAG has further warned that, should the government continue to disregard the agreements, the association’s constituents will embark on a nationwide strike starting March 9, 2026. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the United Kingdom former royal, has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the United Kingdom former royal,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/2/19/live-ex-uk-prince-andrew-arrested-amid-epstein-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been arrested</a>&nbsp;on suspicion of misconduct in public office.</p>



<p>A statement from Thames Valley police was released Thursday that said, “As part of the investigation, we have today (19/2) arrested a man in his sixties from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office and are carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk.”</p>



<p>“The man remains in police custody at this time.”</p>



<p>King Charles II said after arrest that “the law must take its course” in the investigation of his brother.</p>



<p>Mountbatten-Windsor, the British former prince, was stripped of his title last year over his friendship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, amid ongoing furore over accusations against him of sexual assault, which he denies.</p>



<p>Police officers were investigating him for several allegations that emerged after US authorities released&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/30/us-department-of-justice-releases-three-million-new-epstein-documents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 3 million pages</a>&nbsp;of documents relating ⁠to the disgraced financier.</p>



<p>Some of those files suggested that Mountbatten-Windsor had, in 2010, forwarded to Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited on ‌official trips as UK trade envoy. In one confidential memo, he sought Epstein’s views on investment opportunities in Afghanistan’s Helmand province.</p>



<p>“We will not be naming the arrested man, as per national guidance. Please also remember that this case is now active so care should be taken with any publication to avoid being in contempt of court,” the police statement added.</p>



<p>Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said: “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office.</p>



<p>“It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence. We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”</p>



<p>Mountbatten-Windsor should cooperate with the United States authorities in their investigation, the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said. “No one is above the law,” he added. Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently denied any wrongdoing.</p>



<p>“This is such an unprecedented action and move for a prince that was one time the queen’s favourite child, who held a number of high-profile roles within the British establishment, who gradually had this fall from grace because of his association with a convicted pedophile,” said Al Jazeera’s Milena Veselinovic, reporting from London. “This is yet another blow to the branding of the monarchy.”</p>



<p>Michael Walker, a political commentator and contributing editor at Novara Media, says the developments are “incredibly damaging” for the UK’s monarchy and establishment, more generally.</p>



<p>“There is an impression that even though Andrew has been pushed out of the royal family, it was always one step behind,” he told Al Jazeera.</p>



<p>“There is no impression that the royal family sort of learned about these things and was genuinely morally outraged so therefore pushed Andrew to the side,” he added.</p>



<p>“It always seems like they are a step behind, there’s a PR disaster and they say, ‘How do we distance ourselves from this man who is an embarrassment’ – as opposed to “How do we sort of bring about consequences for this man who has morally erred’.”</p>



<p>The arrest comes after the royal family last week&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/9/uk-king-charles-will-support-police-probe-into-ex-prince-andrew-epstein" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committed to cooperate</a>&nbsp;with the police on any investigation regarding Mountbatten-Windsor.</p>

<p>Ghanaian artiste manager, entertainment pundit, and graphic artist Lawrence Nana Asiamah Hanson, popularly known as Bullgod, has shared how former President Nana Addo Danquah Akufo-Addo spearheaded his arrest and had him placed in a prison cell.</p>



<p>According to him, speaking on <strong>Changes</strong> on <strong>Joy Prime</strong>, he addressed the Menzgold saga during a television interview, stating that the former president would not complete his term because of the pain caused to victims whose investments were locked up.</p>



<p>He said he was arrested immediately by a police convoy right after the interview and put behind bars, which he believes was done under Akufo-Addo’s instructions.</p>



<p>“I said he needed to pay the money before he finished his term if eno be so he no go finish his term; he go run away and boom they said I had threatened him. I went to one of the channels, I reach house and wanted to go buy some fufu. So, I was speaking to my PA and then I saw four wheel drives and boys are jumping out with bullet proofs with guns,” he told Roselyn Felli.</p>



<iframe width="1351" height="482" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XjlgSDnh2Ko" title="Bullgod Opens Up About His &#39;Adopt a Prison&#39; Initiative &amp; Time Managing Shatta Wale!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>‘I spent three days at the BNI Cells and was moved because they cannot prosecute me and handed me over to the police. When I was done with my interrogation with the police. They made sure I was put in the hardest cells you can ever find in Accra. Like where they put armed robbers, rapists, killers, etc. I was put in the SWAT cells for two days,” he added.</p>



<p>Bullgod continued by saying that the BNI cells were very large and that he was the only one there. As a result, he was afraid to sleep because he believed his detention was politically motivated and that anything could happen at night, so he stayed awake for three days.</p>



<p>He also revealed that the police are not responsible for feeding prisoners, so if no one brings you food, you remain hungry. He added that whenever food was brought in, he and the others shared it among themselves.</p>



<p>Fortunately for Bullgod, he said he was spared the prison cell leader’s routine because of his popularity.</p>

<p>In today’s <strong><em>Roads of Peril </em></strong>feature, we highlight the negative effect of the poor nature of the Kwabenya-Berekuso-Kitase stretch on healthcare delivery and education.</p>



<p>On the Kwabenya-Berekuso-Kitase stretch, pupils make their way to and from school along a dusty, pothole-ridden road.</p>



<p>Covering their faces with handkerchiefs has become part of the daily routine as every passing vehicle leaves behind a haze of dust that blurs visibility.</p>



<p>Beyond the classroom, the impact is evident at the Berekuso Health Centre, where health workers report increasing respiratory diseases. More in today’s episode of “Roads of Peril” by Pearl Ofori.</p>

<p>The Narcotics Control Commission (NACOC) has intensified behavioural detection operations at Kotoka International Airport (KIA) as part of renewed efforts to curb narcotics trafficking through Ghana’s main international gateway.</p>



<p>The exercise, spearheaded by NACOC’s Canine (K9) Unit in collaboration with its Enforcement Unit stationed at the airport, focused on screening both inbound and outbound passengers exhibiting behavioural indicators commonly associated with drug trafficking.</p>

<p>Officers deployed trained sniffer dogs, advanced scanning equipment and profiling techniques to monitor passenger movement, while ensuring minimal disruption to airport operations, NACOC said in a statement.</p>



<p>Although the operation focused on selected airlines, individuals identified as persons of interest were subjected to further scrutiny regardless of their airline or flight, underscoring what officials described as a non-discriminatory, intelligence-led approach.</p>

<p>Strategic searches were conducted at key locations within the airport enclave, including Aviance Ghana, a major ground-handling facility.</p>



<p>According to NACOC, the targeted interventions form part of a broader security strategy aimed at sealing operational loopholes frequently exploited by traffickers.</p>

<p>Beyond enforcement, officers used the exercise to sensitise passengers and airport staff to substance abuse, the dangers associated with drug trafficking and the legal consequences of narcotics-related offences. </p>



<p>The increased visibility of the K9 Unit was also intended to serve as a deterrent and to reinforce public confidence in the Commission’s operations.</p>

<p>NACOC reported that the operation resulted in the seizure of quantities of pethidine and morphine, both classified as controlled drugs under Ghanaian law. </p>



<p>Officials said the development highlights the effectiveness of intelligence-driven enforcement combined with canine-assisted searches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Member of Parliament for Gomoa Central, <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0">Kwame Asare Obeng</a>, popularly known as A Plus, has announced plans to sponsor a private member’s bill in Parliament to punish women who engage in paternity fraud.</p>



<p>Speaking on Prime Time with <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1">George Quaye</a>, he said there should be “a legislation that prescribes punishment for people who engage in paternity fraud”.</p>



<p>According to A Plus, some women are aware they had multiple partners within a certain period. He stated that “women knows that between a certain period they were having something to do with one or two men”.</p>



<p>He backed his claim with an account of his experience at a health facility, saying “out of 10 women who come for DNA with their kids about four do not belong to the men”.</p>



<p>The Gomoa Central MP argued that punishment for paternity fraud should be severe, particularly where the woman is married. He said, “the punishment must be more if she’s married than a single woman”.</p>



<p>He stressed the emotional and financial burden on men who unknowingly raise children who are not biologically theirs. As an example, he cited situations where “a woman goes to court with her husband and three kids or four kids do not belong to the man”.</p>



<p>A Plus maintained that there is “no justification” for a woman to deceive a man about paternity, even if she had suffered abuse for being barren. He called for sanctions “if a DNA test is done and it is discovered that you the woman went to cheat or for whatever reason the child is not your husband’s and you hadn’t declared it early on”.</p>



<p>He further pointed to what he described as the severe consequences for men who discover such cases later in life, recounting an instance where “somebody committed suicide somewhere outside” after learning that the children he had raised were not biologically his.</p>

<p>The Ga Mantse Tackie Teiko Tsuru II is in a stable condition following a road accident in the early hours of Wednesday.</p>



<p>The incident occurred at about 2:00 am at Pai-Katanga in the Oti Region while the King was returning to Accra from Tamale.</p>



<p>Sources close to the palace said he had travelled to the Northern Region on a private visit at the invitation of the Yaa Naa.</p>



<p>The visit, described as cordial and significant, formed part of ongoing engagements between traditional authorities aimed at strengthening bonds of unity and mutual respect among Ghana’s revered institutions.</p>



<p>However, on his return journey to Accra, the Ga Mantse’s vehicle was involved in an accident. He escaped unhurt and is reported to be in stable condition.</p>



<p>Personnel of the Ghana Police Service were said to have responded swiftly when they were alerted to the scene.</p>



<p>Although the full circumstances surrounding the accident are yet to be detailed, the mood at the palace is said to be one of relief and thanksgiving, as the Ga Mantse remains in good spirits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghanaian artiste manager, entertainment pundit and graphic artist <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0">Lawrence Nana Asiamah Hanson</a>, popularly known as BullGod, has opened up about his experiences in police custody, revealing that the longest he has stayed in a prison cell was one month.</p>



<p>He made the disclosure on <em>Changes,</em> an afternoon show on <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1">JoyPrime</a>, on 18th February 2026.</p>



<p>‘I spent three days at the BNI Cells’ he shared. He explained that he was arrested over alleged threats against former President <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=2">Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo</a> after he said, “He needed to pay the money before he finishes his term, if eno be so he no go finish his term and he go run away”.</p>



<p>According to Bullgod, he was later moved from the <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=3">Bureau of National Investigations</a> cells because they could not prosecute him. He said he was handed over to the police after interrogation and locked up for two days in a SWAT cell, where he met suspected killers and kidnappers.</p>



<p>“The cells were scary” he said, “When you enter for the first time you will be hugged by something and that is, the stench and you go feel am” he shared. “And the washroom waters don’t run” he continued.</p>



<p>Bull also said the BNI cells were very large and he was the only one there. He added that he was afraid to sleep because he believed his arrest was politically motivated and anything could happen at night, so he stayed awake for three days.</p>



<p>He said he was later transferred to another cell for two days and did not shower or use the washroom. “The place is not convenient” he said.</p>



<p>He further narrated that on a Friday, he was expected to appear in court to seek bail. Around 5 o’clock, he said nature called and when he went to the washroom, he saw two men seated on the toilet bowl asleep. Another man, he said, leaned against a partition to sleep because the place was overcrowded. Close to 40 people were sharing the cell, with some staying there for two years, one month, six months and eight months.</p>



<p>He revealed, “The police is not responsible to feed the prisoners so when no one brings you food you stay hungry, so him along with others when they receive their food they share with everyone”.</p>



<p>Furthermore, he said, “When you get to a prison cell, you will be asked to follow a routine by the cell leader, luckily for me I didn’t follow the routine because we put our faces out there”.</p>



<p>“The longest I have stayed in a prison cell was month” Bull God revealed as he narrated how he was arrested in connection with the alleged murder of <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=4">Fennec Okyere</a>.</p>



<p>He later said, “I felt bad at that moment but now I don’t because it was meant to make me strong”.</p>



<p>His experiences, he noted, have inspired a new initiative dubbed “Adopt A Cell”. The project seeks to bring art into prison cells through graffiti, murals and other creative works. “We believe Art has healing powers to calm the nerves” he said.</p>



<p>“We have a police cell design befitting for people in the holding cells and it’s a nationwide project”.</p>



<p>Do you support Bull God with this initiative? Do you think he was meant to go through these experiences? Share your thoughts.</p>

<p>Former Vice President of Ghana and New Patriotic Party (NPP) flagbearer, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, has paid tribute to the late Dr Alhaji&nbsp;Abubakari&nbsp;Sidick&nbsp;Ahmed, former Station Manager of Radio Univers 105.7 FM, highlighting his personal connection and the enduring impact the media veteran had on his career.</p>



<p>Speaking on Thursday at Alhaji Abubakar’s residence following his passing, Dr Bawumia said the late broadcaster gave him his very first radio interview in Ghana — a moment he said he has never forgotten. “I had never spoken on any radio or TV station, never. But he gave me my very first interview in Ghana, and I’ve never forgotten that,” Dr Bawumia recalled during the condolences. </p>

<p>Alhaji Sadick Abubakar, also affectionately known simply as <em>Alhaji</em>, died on Monday, February 17, 2026, at the University of Ghana Medical Centre, where he had been receiving treatment in recent days. He was 63 years old. </p>



<p>Dr Bawumia described how their friendship continued over more than two decades, including moments such as when he was in Zimbabwe in 2011, and Abubakar reached out to him while seeking medical care in South Africa. “We have maintained a close friendship, and, sadly, he’s not with us today,” he added. </p>

<p>In his remarks, the former vice president drew on Islamic teachings to reflect on life’s impermanence and the importance of living with moral consciousness.</p>



<p>“The Quran tells us that death is a certainty, and it will reach all of us… we should live on this earth as if we are travellers or strangers,” Dr Bawumia said, urging people to consider how awareness of mortality can shape behaviour. </p>



<p>Dr Alhaji&nbsp;Abubakari&nbsp;Sidick&nbsp;Ahmed was recognised as a doyen of Ghanaian media, known for mentoring generations of broadcasters and for transforming Radio Univers into a respected training ground for journalists. </p>



<p>His tenure included leadership in major programming innovations and fostering strong ties between academic training and professional broadcasting. </p>



<p>Tributes have poured in from media professionals and academic institutions alike. </p>



<p>The Department of Communication Studies at the University of Ghana described him as a foundational figure who helped shape careers and strengthen ethical journalism in the country. </p>



<p>Alhaji Abubakar’s influence extended well beyond campus radio. </p>



<p>His protégés now hold positions in major media houses across Ghana and internationally, continuing the legacy he built over decades of service. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[South Korea's ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol has been jailed for life for masterminding an insurrection by trying to impose military rule.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>South Korea&#8217;s ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol has been jailed for life for masterminding an insurrection by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6277zz434zo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying to impose military rule</a>.</p>



<p>Yoon attempted to subvert the constitution by deploying military troops to seal off the National Assembly and ordering the arrest of politicians on 3 December 2024, a Seoul court ruled. His actions fundamentally damaged South Korea&#8217;s democracy and deserves a harsh punishment, presiding judge Ji Gwi-yeon told the court.</p>



<p>Prosecutors had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6vyqq5r0do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sought the death penalty</a>.</p>



<p>Though it was short-lived, Yoon&#8217;s martial law order left the nation<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yv4p95m6vo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;more polarised than ever</a>, and those deep divisions were on full display as the sentencing took place.</p>



<p>Huge crowds of Yoon&#8217;s supporters gathered outside the court hours before the hearing, holding banners reading &#8220;Yoon, again&#8221;. Many of them broke down in tears following the verdict.</p>



<p>Also present were anti-Yoon protesters, rallying for him to be sentenced to death.</p>



<p>Yoon himself showed no emotion as he learned of his fate. His lawyers alleged that the verdict was not backed by evidence and accused the judge of following a &#8220;pre-written script&#8221;.</p>



<p>If either side launches an appeal, the case will go up to the Supreme Court, which means it could be months before the verdict is finalised.</p>



<p>Yoon shocked his nation on 3 December 2024 by declaring martial law on live television.</p>



<p>He claimed it was to protect the country from &#8220;anti-state&#8221; forces that sympathised with North Korea, but it soon became clear he was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y7jxe88w3o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driven by domestic troubles</a>: the opposition which held a parliamentary majority left him a lame duck president, while his wife Kim Keon Hee was at the centre of various corruption allegations.</p>



<p>He rolled back the order within hours, after lawmakers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98lygwd837o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fought their way into the National Assembly</a>&nbsp;to overturn it.</p>



<p>What followed were months of political chaos,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz01mjv0v0go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoon&#8217;s impeachment</a>, and a string of indictments against him and other top officials.</p>



<p>Former prime minister Han Duck-soo was handed a 23-year jail term last month for his part in the insurrection, while ex-defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who advised Yoon to impose martial law, was jailed for 30 years on Thursday.</p>



<p>Former interior minister Lee Sang-min, former intelligence commander Roh Sang-won, and ex-police chief Cho Ji-ho were among the other officials jailed for what judges have described as &#8220;an insurrection from the top&#8221;.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1522/live/b40afac0-0d71-11f1-b1f2-a50c2c5773ab.jpg.webp" alt="AFP via Getty Images A female Yoon supporter, who&#039;s holding a flat, and wearing a visor, sunglases and a winter coat, cries out as the verdict is delivered" title="South Korea&#039;s ex-president jailed for life over martial law attempt"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Many of Yoon&#8217;s supporters broke down in tears following the verdict</figcaption></figure>



<p>Security was tight outside the court on Thursday, with dozens of police buses forming a cordon to restrict public access. Some 1,000 officers were deployed for security operations, local media reported.</p>



<p>Inside the court, judge Ji called Yoon the &#8220;insurrectionist leader&#8221;, although the judging panel found insufficient evidence to rule that he&#8217;d planned the martial law order a year before his announcement.</p>



<p>Yoon defended his actions throughout his trial, arguing that as president he had had the authority to declare martial law, sounding the alarm over opposition parties&#8217; obstruction of government.</p>



<p>He maintained that the order was necessary &#8220;to protect the freedom and sovereignty of the people and to preserve the nation and its constitution&#8221;.</p>



<p>The ruling Democratic Party, which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq549p1yd2eo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the presidential election</a>&nbsp;after Yoon&#8217;s ouster, accused the court of &#8220;undermining judicial justice&#8221; by not sentencing Yoon to death.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Yoon] masterminded an insurrection that shook the very foundations of our nation,&#8221; party leader Jung Chung-rae said.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Today&#8217;s decision] is a clear regress from the people&#8217;s revolution&#8230; The public will find it deeply unsatisfactory and unacceptable.&#8221;</p>



<p>South Korea has not executed anyone on death row since December 1997, so even a death penalty for Yoon would, in effect, be life imprisonment.</p>



<p>Yoon is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4qdpxp78po" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already serving jail time</a>&nbsp;for abuse of power and obstructing his own arrest after the martial law order. He still faces three more related trials.</p>



<p>Several former presidents before Yoon had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93gqwek5jyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also been convicted and jailed</a>, but were pardoned after serving just two to five years in prison – and many expect the same for Yoon.</p>

<p>The Founder and Creative Director of Bullhaus Entertainment, Lawrence Nana Asiamah Hanson, widely called Bullgod, has shared how devastating it is to spend time in Ghana’s prison cells.</p>



<p>He stated that he spent a few days in police custody after being arrested and detained on the directives of former President Nana Addo Danquah Akufo-Addo.</p>



<p>Speaking on <strong>Changes </strong>on <strong>Joy Prime</strong>, Bullgod described the experience as scary and said it is not a place he would wish for anyone to be.</p>



<p>“I was held at the BNI cells for three days then I was moved from the BNI cells because they cannot prosecute me and they handed me over to the police. When I was done with my interrogation with the police, I was locked up for another two days. They made sure I was put in the hardest cells you can ever find in Accra. Like where they put armed robbers, rapists, killers, etc.”</p>



<iframe width="1351" height="482" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XjlgSDnh2Ko" title="Bullgod Opens Up About His &#39;Adopt a Prison&#39; Initiative &amp; Time Managing Shatta Wale!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“The place is scary,” he told the host Roselyn Felli, adding that it’s not a place he wishes for anybody to be.</p>



<p>He further revealed that the sting in the cells is horrible as there&#8217;s no enough ventilation. He noted that the washrooms are not sufficient for the inmates, making then struggle to ease themselves.</p>



<p>The terrible experience he encountered stemmed from him voicing his opinions and grievances in public, as he was a victim of the Menzgold saga, which was shut down by the Nana Addo Danquah Akufo-Addo-led administration, causing him to lose over 1 million cedis.</p>



<p>Following that, Bullgod has consistently expressed his dislike for the former president.</p>



<p>Based on his experience in the cells, the talent manager has introduced an initiative dubbed “Adopt a Cell” to help improve conditions in Ghana’s prisons and make them more comfortable for inmates.</p>
