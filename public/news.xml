<p>A fire has gutted one of the heritage trains owned by Ghanaian creative artist and author Ibrahim Mahama at his Red Clay Studio in Tamale, Northern Region.</p>



<p>The incident occurred on Wednesday, February 18, 2026, during ongoing repair work on the train.</p>



<p>In a Facebook post on Thursday, February 19, Mr. Mahama described the loss as a “tragic misfortune,” explaining that sparks from repair activities ignited the blaze.</p>

<p>“Certainly, I am sure if a lot more care had been taken, this could have been prevented,” he noted.</p>



<p>The affected train was part of a collection of decommissioned colonial-era and post-independence railway stock acquired by Mahama nearly two years ago from the Ghana Railway Company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Government has proposed renaming the National Intelligence Bureau (NIB) as the Bureau of National Intelligence (BNI) under the Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025, to reduce public confusion with the National Investment Bank.</p>



<p>The announcement was made by the Minister of the Interior, Mohammed Mubarak Muntaka, during parliamentary deliberations on Thursday, February 19, 2026.</p>



<p>Addressing Members of Parliament, the Minister explained that the overlap of acronyms has created unnecessary ambiguity within the country’s security framework.</p>



<p>“Everywhere in the world, you make sure that the acronyms for the security agencies do not match any other thing, and in fact, it is supported by law to make sure that nobody is able to name anything after an acronym of any of the security agencies,” he said.</p>



<p>He emphasised that the change seeks to align Ghana’s practices with international norms.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, we have a situation where, when you say NIB, people are wondering whether you’re talking about the bank or you’re talking about the security agency. </p>



<p>&#8220;So Mister Speaker, one of the significant things that we are trying to do is to reintroduce the name BNI at this time, even though the BNI of yesterday was Bureau of National Investigation, this BNI will still remain Bureau of National Intelligence,” Minister Muntaka explained.</p>



<p>The Bill also proposes eliminating the Ministry of National Security portfolio to streamline operations and reduce role duplication.</p>



<p>Instead, the President will designate a Minister to oversee the National Security Coordinator.</p>



<p>“A detailed ministerial role and the function of the national security coordinator… if you assign or leave a ministry called Ministry of National Security… they begin to conflate, and they begin to have misunderstandings, and that affects the security architecture that we have in the country,” the Minister noted.</p>



<p>He further clarified the intended oversight framework: “One of the things that we are trying to do is to keep this position as more or less of that of the President, and then he gets one of his ministers to play that oversight without the necessarily fine, detailed designation of a minister for national security, so that as much as possible you try to avoid the conflict between the minister and the National Security Coordinator.”</p>



<p>The proposed reforms are part of a broader initiative to strengthen Ghana’s security institutions while ensuring clarity, efficiency, and alignment with global best practices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President of the Association of Ghana Industries, Dr Kofi Nsiah-Poku, has warned that persistent water shortages, high interest rates and rising unemployment are threatening Ghana’s industrial growth.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News&#8217; PM Express Business Edition on Thursday, he painted a stark picture of the operational challenges facing manufacturers, especially beverage producers that depend heavily on water.</p>



<p>“It is so bad in the sense that for about two weeks, water wasn’t running, and when it started, they were rationing it twice a week, and it runs for about only six hours,” he said.</p>



<p>Dr Nsiah-Poku revealed that even his own fruit juice factory has been affected.</p>



<p>“I also have an industry there producing fruit juice, and they work only twice, and we have to buy water from outside to put in the water tanks before you can do production,” he disclosed.</p>



<p>According to him, such conditions make serious industrialisation impossible.</p>



<p>“So as a nation, we cannot industrialise with this kind of situation,” he stressed.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8o9iYFErvE?si=ifA-B0no6vcr7XoI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>Beyond water shortages, he pointed to the impact of previously high interest rates on business expansion.</p>



<p>“Even before, the interest rate was so high that you know, it was not worth borrowing money to do business,” he said.</p>



<p>He explained that the high rates distorted economic incentives.</p>



<p>“It was rather more interesting to really change your money, your asset, into cash, and just go and buy treasury bills,” he noted.</p>



<p>Dr Nsiah-Poku said the combined effect of weak industrial growth and financial pressures has had consequences for employment.</p>



<p>“So unemployment has become very high because the industry is not growing, it’s rather falling,” he said.</p>



<p>Despite the grim assessment, he signalled the need for a turnaround.</p>



<p>“But we’ve come to a point where we have to reverse it, and that is what I’ve come to do,” he added.</p>



<p>His remarks highlight mounting pressure on the productive sector, as manufacturers grapple with unreliable utilities and financial constraints.</p>



<p>For an economy seeking to expand local production and create jobs, the AGI President’s warning underscores the urgency of stabilising critical infrastructure and reducing the cost of doing business.</p>



<p>Without reliable water and affordable financing, he suggests, industry cannot thrive — and jobs will remain at risk.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Sagnarigu MP, Atta Issah, has disclosed that the government intends to mobilise approximately GH₵30 billion through a syndicated domestic bond to stabilise the operations of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD).</p>



<p>The move comes amid mounting concerns about the cocoa regulator’s financial health and its urgent need for substantial working capital.</p>



<p>The issue was first highlighted at a press conference on Thursday, February 19, 2026, where the Chairman of the Finance Committee and MP for Bolgatanga Central, Isaac Adongo, stated that COCOBOD requires more than GH₵30 billion to remain operational.</p>



<p>“The scale of COCOBOD’s working capital requirement is significant, and decisive action is needed to keep the institution afloat,” he indicated.</p>



<p>Mr Issah explained that the government would shift its focus from the international financial market, which he described as currently unfavourable to Ghana, and instead raise funds domestically.</p>



<p>“We are pivoting away from the international market because conditions are not favourable. The alternative is to issue a syndicated domestic bond backed by government guarantees,” he said.</p>



<p>He noted that similar financing models have been successfully implemented in countries such as Côte d’Ivoire, Ecuador, Brazil, and Nigeria.</p>



<p>According to him, Ghana’s ongoing debt restructuring programme has strengthened the country’s balance sheet and is restoring investor confidence.</p>



<p>“Recent treasury bill issuances were oversubscribed because investors view government liabilities as largely risk-free. If we structure this well, we can raise more than the GH₵30 billion required,” Mr Issah stated.</p>



<p>The lawmaker expressed optimism that the bond issuance would not only secure the needed working capital for COCOBOD but also create a pathway for reforms within the cocoa sector.</p>



<p>“With these reforms and the necessary liquidity, COCOBOD will be better positioned to sustain operations and make the industry more sustainable,” he added in an interview with Citi FM on Thursday, February 19.</p>

<p>A fatal road accident at Kaase in the Asokwa Municipality of the Ashanti Region has claimed the life of a 55-year-old trader after a gas tanker reportedly suffered brake failure on a hill.</p>



<p>The tanker, bearing registration number GT 5560-16, was said to be climbing towards the Kuwait area when it began rolling backwards uncontrollably.</p>



<p>In its path were several vehicles that had come to a stop on the stretch, including two trotros and a Toyota Vitz.</p>



<p>The deceased, identified as Owusu and popularly known as “Wayomi,” was seated in the front of one of the trotros directly behind the tanker.</p>



<p>As the heavy vehicle reversed, it rammed into the trotro and the saloon car behind it.</p>



<p>Reports indicate that Mr Owusu attempted to escape but became trapped beneath the tanker, dying at the scene. He is survived by a wife and three children.</p>



<p>A nurse who was driving her mother in the Toyota Vitz was also caught up in the crash but survived. In total, about five vehicles were affected by the incident, leading to significant traffic disruption in the area.</p>



<p>Personnel from the Ghana Police Service and the Ghana National Fire Service responded promptly to the scene.</p>



<p>The victim’s body has since been deposited at the morgue of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, while security agencies worked to clear the wreckage and restore the free flow of traffic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A proposed Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill triggered heated exchanges in Parliament, as the government moves to restructure Ghana’s national security architecture and change the name of the National Investigations Bureau (NIB) back to Bureau of National Intelligence (BNI).</p>



<p>The bill, laid before Parliament by the Minister for the Interior, Muntaka Mohammed-Mubarak, on Thursday, February 19, seeks to address what the government describes as public confusion between the National Investigations Bureau (NIB) and the National Investment Bank, which share the same acronym.</p>



<p>Under the proposed law, the intelligence agency will revert to the name Bureau of National Intelligence (BNI), distinct from its former historical title, Bureau of National Investigation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="956" height="625" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-1.png" alt="Majority, Minority clash over bill to revert NIB name to BNI and overhaul National Security structure" class="wp-image-10032982749" title="Majority, Minority clash over bill to revert NIB name to BNI and overhaul National Security structure" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-1.png 956w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-1-300x196.png 300w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-1-768x502.png 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-1-459x300.png 459w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-1-214x140.png 214w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-1-150x98.png 150w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-1-218x143.png 218w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-1-649x424.png 649w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-1-330x216.png 330w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-1-225x147.png 225w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-1-217x142.png 217w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-1-340x222.png 340w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-1-229x150.png 229w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-1-55x36.png 55w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 956px) 100vw, 956px" /></figure>



<p>The bill also proposes a major restructuring of national security governance by scrapping the Ministry for National Security, with oversight functions to be exercised through the Presidency.</p>



<p>Presenting the bill, Mr. Mohammed-Mubarak argued that the reforms are necessary to streamline coordination and avoid institutional conflicts.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, we have a situation where you say NIB, people are wondering whether you are talking about the bank or the security agency. So one of the significant things we are trying to do is to reintroduce the name BNI… Bureau of National Intelligence,” he said.</p>



<p>He added that the new structure is intended to prevent conflict between a Minister for National Security and the National Security Coordinator, stressing that coordination should be firmly anchored under the President with ministerial oversight rather than a standalone ministry.</p>



<p>However, the proposals immediately drew strong opposition from the Minority, who described the bill as flawed, overly centralising power, and lacking safeguards.</p>



<p>Former Defence Minister, Dominic Nitiwul, questioned the policy rationale behind the reforms, warning that the changes could create instability and weaken accountability.</p>

<p>“If in four years you are no more in power, are we expecting a new government to also bring a new Act to reflect their direction?” he asked.</p>



<p>“It will be dangerous for this nation to make that office and agency so powerful without proper accountability. It’s a misplaced priority, and if you do that, you’ll suffer.”</p>



<p>Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin also rejected the bill, arguing that it is politically motivated rather than evidence-based.</p>

<p>“The memorandum before us does not provide any empirical evidence to suggest that Act 1030 has failed,” he said.</p>



<p>“So much power is being given to the coordinator, and it is not clear how his powers are going to be fettered.</p>



<p>“Without clear responsibility, accountability and oversight, this becomes problematic. When citizens’ rights are abused, it will be justified in the name of national security.”</p>



<p>He called for further consultations and amendments to incorporate concerns raised by the Minority.</p>

<p>Responding to the criticism, the Majority Leader, Mahama Ayariga, defended the bill, describing it as a correction of what he termed a “historical wrong” created by the previous administration.</p>



<p>“We decided to cut down the number of ministers, and among the ministries we guillotined was the Ministry for National Security,” he said.</p>



<p>“What you [NPP] did was to force the hand of a President to appoint a Minister for National Security. It was a wrong thing for us to have done as a Parliament, and this historical wrong has to be corrected.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President of the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), Dr Kofi Nsiah-Poku, says worsening water shortages are severely disrupting production and threatening Ghana’s industrialisation drive.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express Business Edition on Thursday, he described the situation as critical, especially for beverage manufacturers that depend heavily on water as a primary input.</p>



<p>“It is so bad in the sense that for about two weeks, water wasn’t running,” he said.</p>



<p>According to him, even when supply resumed, it has been unreliable and limited.</p>



<p>“When it started, they rationed it twice a week, and it ran for about only six hours,” he explained.</p>



<p>Dr Nsiah-Poku revealed that his own fruit juice production facility has been directly affected.</p>



<p>“I also have an industry there producing fruit juice, and they work only twice, and we have to buy water from outside to put in the water tanks before you can do production,” he said.</p>



<p>The added cost of sourcing water externally, he indicated, places additional strain on businesses already battling high operating expenses.</p>



<p>He warned that such conditions undermine Ghana’s ambition to industrialise.</p>



<p>“As a nation, we cannot industrialise with this kind of situation,” he stressed.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8o9iYFErvE?si=ifA-B0no6vcr7XoI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>Beyond the water crisis, Dr Nsiah-Poku pointed to the broader financial environment that has constrained industry growth in recent years.</p>



<p>He said high interest rates previously made borrowing unattractive for businesses.</p>



<p>“Even before, the interest rate was so high that, you know, it was not worth borrowing money to do business,” he stated.</p>



<p>Instead of investing in production, he suggested that capital flowed into safer government instruments.</p>



<p>“It was rather more interesting to really change your money, your asset, into cash, and just go and buy treasury bills,” he said.</p>



<p>The result, he noted, has been declining industrial activity and rising unemployment.</p>



<p>“So unemployment has become very high because the industry is not growing, it’s rather falling,” he said.</p>



<p>Dr Nsiah-Poku, however, believes the country has reached a turning point.</p>



<p>“We’ve come to a point where we have to reverse it, and that is what I’ve come to do,” he declared.</p>



<p>His comments highlight mounting concerns within the manufacturing sector that unreliable water supply, combined with past financial pressures, is stalling growth and limiting job creation.</p>



<p>For industries that rely on water daily, the crisis is no longer an inconvenience. It is a production threat.</p>

<p>The Office of the Ga Mantse has confirmed that King Tackie Teiko Tsuru II was involved in a vehicle accident in the Oti Region on Tuesday evening, February 17, 2026, while returning to Accra from an urgent mission.</p>



<p>In an official statement, the Palace assured the public that there were no casualties from the incident.</p>



<p>“With the grace of God, there were no casualties, and with Police assistance and the support of his aides on board the vehicles involved, everyone was successfully evacuated to Accra,” the statement said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Director of the Presidential Initiative in Agriculture and Agri-Business at the Office of the President, Peter Boamah Otokunor, has alleged that the debt burden of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) under the New Patriotic Party (NPP) government exceeded the institution’s total assets.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on Asempa FM’s Ekosii Sen, Dr. Otokunor questioned how the current administration could be expected to resolve all of COCOBOD’s challenges at once, given what he described as the scale of inherited debt.</p>



<p>“COCOBOD’s debt was greater than all its assets, so how do you expect the government to solve all its problems at once?” he asked.</p>



<p>He further raised concerns over the procurement of cocoa sacks, explaining that in 2021 imported sacks were stored in a warehouse, while additional consignments ordered in 2022, 2023, and 2024 were left uncleared at the port.</p>



<p>According to him, just four days before the general elections, letters of credit worth $48 million were issued to import yet another batch of sacks.</p>



<p>Dr. Otokunor described the situation as troubling, particularly given the economic difficulties the country was facing at the time.</p>



<p>He noted that the sacks currently in use are from earlier imports stored in warehouses.</p>



<p>He maintained that the financial and procurement decisions taken under the previous administration significantly strained COCOBOD’s operations and contributed to its current challenges.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Deputy Minister of Trade, Agribusiness and Industry has dismissed the recent protest by cocoa farmers in Sehwi Wiawso as politically orchestrated, insisting it did not reflect the concerns of the broader farming community.</p>



<p>The demonstration followed a reduction in the producer price of cocoa from GH¢3,625 to GH¢2,587 per bag, a move that sparked anger among farmers in Sefwi Wiawso, Juaboso and Bia West.</p>



<p>During the march, protesters carried placards expressing frustration over the price adjustment, with slogans accusing government of betrayal and warning against cutting farmers’ earnings.</p>



<p>One banner controversially likened former President John Dramani Mahama to a public health threat. The demonstration drew attention to growing tensions within cocoa-growing communities.</p>



<p>Government officials, however, maintain that the price determination was based on global market realities.</p>



<p>At the start of the 2025/26 cocoa season, the international price of cocoa stood at approximately $7,200 per tonne. In line with a pledge to allocate 70 per cent of the world market price to farmers, the producer price was initially fixed at $5,040 per tonne, translating to GH¢3,625 per bag.</p>



<p>Speaking on Citi FM on February 19, 2026, the Member of Parliament for Bodi, Sampson Ahi, contended that the protest was driven by a small group of opposition supporters rather than genuine farmers.</p>



<p>“The supposed demonstration that took place in Sehwi Wiawso was just some mobilisation of a few NPP guys. They even bused people from Kumasi,” he alleged.</p>



<p>Mr Ahi emphasised that government remains willing to engage with legitimate cocoa farmers who have concerns about developments in the sector.</p>



<p>He said authorities are prepared to explain the pricing structure and ongoing reforms, expressing confidence that farmers would understand the broader economic context shaping the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Majority Caucus in Parliament has accused appointees of the former Nana Akufo-Addo administration of gross mismanagement at the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), which has worsened the current challenges in the cocoa sector.</p>



<p>The remarks were made on February 19 by the Chairman of Parliament’s Finance Committee, Isaac Adongo, during a press briefing.</p>



<p>He claimed that poor logistical decisions, particularly in handling jute sacks used for cocoa packaging, had imposed unnecessary financial burdens on the state.</p>



<p>According to Mr Adongo, COCOBOD had approximately 286,000 bales of jute sacks at the ports, but cleared only 91,000, leaving a significant quantity uncleared.</p>



<p>He further alleged that shortly before leaving office, the previous administration authorised the procurement of an additional 80,000 bales at a reported cost of GH¢48 million.</p>



<p>Describing the move as imprudent, Mr Adongo argued that such decisions deprived the state of funds that could have been channelled into supporting cocoa farmers. He maintained that these actions contributed directly to the financial strain currently confronting the cocoa industry.</p>



<p>The Majority insists that accountability must follow, as government under President John Dramani Mahama rolls out reforms aimed at stabilising production and restoring financial discipline within the sector.</p>



<p>“If it were possible in the days that we were whipping people, these are the people we have to line up and tell cocoa farmers that it is the conduct of these people that denied the government of Ghana the resources to properly take care of you at this point in time.&#8221;</p>



<p>“So that we will give everybody a cane, and cocoa farmers will whip them. Then we will know who is at fault. But these are the type of people who can sing and dance better than everybody. They think that if you tell a lie many times, it becomes the truth,” he said.</p>



<p>The Caucus maintains that restoring transparency and prudent management practices is essential to rebuilding confidence in Ghana’s cocoa industry.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Trade, Agribusiness and Industry has condemned the killing of Ghanaian tomato traders in an attack at Titao in northern Burkina Faso, describing the incident as a senseless assault on innocent civilians engaged in lawful business activities.</p>



<p>In a statement issued on February 18, the Ministry confirmed that eight Ghanaian nationals lost their lives, while several others sustained injuries in the attack, which took place in a region grappling with extremist violence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ranking Member of Parliament’s Defence and Interior Committee and Member of Parliament for Assin South, Rev. John Ntim Fordjour, has criticised the state over what he describes as a preventable security lapse following the killing of eight Ghanaian traders in Burkina Faso.</p>



<p>Contributing to a statement on the floor of Parliament on February 19, 2026, Rev. Ntim Fordjour said the government failed to act proactively despite the well-known security threats in the sub-region.</p>



<p>The attack, which occurred on February 14 in a volatile area affected by extremist violence, left eight Ghanaians dead and several others injured.</p>



<p>“Mr Speaker, I want to first point out the security failure of the state because these killings are avoidable,” he stated.</p>



<p>“The geopolitics of the sub-region is a matter of public knowledge. The terrorism threats and crises within our neighbouring countries, especially Burkina Faso, are not in doubt or did not start from yesterday.”</p>



<p>He argued that authorities ought to have issued a travel advisory to caution Ghanaian traders and travellers heading to high-risk areas.</p>



<p>“For the failure of the state to even provide a travel advisory ahead of time to advise travellers to Burkina Faso, and for these traders to be led to the slaughter is most regrettable,” he said.</p>



<p>Rev. Ntim Fordjour urged government to strengthen intelligence coordination and cross-border security engagement to prevent future tragedies.</p>



<p>He maintained that timely communication and preventive measures are critical in safeguarding Ghanaian citizens operating within unstable zones in the sub-region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Majority Caucus in Parliament has pushed back against demands for an emergency bailout for cocoa farmers, insisting that Ghana’s cocoa sector cannot sustain further borrowing.</p>



<p>The Caucus attributes the financial strain facing the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) to what it describes as excessive debt accumulated under the administration of former President Nana Akufo-Addo.</p>



<p>Addressing journalists on February 19, the Chairman of Parliament’s Finance Committee, Isaac Adongo, said the sector was left in severe financial distress, making new debt-financed interventions imprudent.</p>



<p>His remarks were in response to calls from the Minority urging the government to provide liquidity support to cushion farmers against falling international cocoa prices and a 28 per cent reduction in the producer price.</p>



<p>The Minority had proposed that emergency funds be released to enable nearly one million cocoa farmers to receive timely payments and to prevent a drop of more than GH¢1,000 per bag. However, Mr Adongo argued that Ghana’s debt exposure makes additional borrowing from international capital markets unrealistic.</p>



<p>“Loans alone were GHC17.8 billion at the beginning of 2025. And if you add this to other obligations, you will realise that at this point, COCOBOD was bleeding with an exposure of over GH¢60 billion. Certainly, that vehicle could not be sustainable and needed to be addressed,” he stated. He further criticised proposals for additional loans, saying,</p>



<p>“They are advising us to add debts when we cannot even pay GHC60 billion. We’re resetting the cocoa sector.”</p>



<p>The Majority maintained that restoring fiscal discipline and restructuring the cocoa industry offer a more durable path forward than short-term bailouts.</p>



<p>According to Mr Adongo, government reforms will focus on debt restructuring, improved financial management and targeted interventions to protect farmers while securing the long-term sustainability of Ghana’s flagship agricultural sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commissioner-General of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), Anthony Kwasi Sarpong, assured the authority’s readiness to mobilise the GH¢360 billion minimum revenue target for 2028.</p>



<p>In that regard, he asked the public to insist on receiving Value Added Tax (VAT) invoices whenever they made purchases, urging all taxpayers to honour their taxes obligations, saying that tax payment remained a civic responsibility of all.</p>



<p>Mr Sarpong gave the assurance when speaking at a three-day management retreat of the Domestic Tax Revenue Division (DTRD) of the GRA, underway in Sunyani.</p>



<p>The 2026 DTRD Retreat is on the theme: “Transforming for impact and growth: Focusing on VAT performance and compliance”.</p>



<p>Mr Sarpong said tax education remained imperative if the DTRD could mobilize the targeted revenue, and called for support towards intensified education for tax payers to understand the essence of paying their taxes promptly and regularly.</p>



<p>He called on the public to support the activities of the DTRD, particularly payment of the VAT, saying that with collective efforts, the GRA could deliver its mandate to mobilize the required revenue for progressive development.</p>



<p>“The GRA must remain focused on its revenue mobilization agenda to meet the minimum of GH¢360 billion by 2028 and to support the national development agenda”, he advised.</p>



<p>Mr Sarpong said though the government tasked the GRA to raise not less than GH¢225 billion target the 2026 fiscal year target, “the management of the Authority has set to mobilize an internal target of GH¢230 billion”.</p>



<p>He said as part of efforts to achieve the target, management had tasked the DTRD to mobilize GH¢163 billion.</p>



<p>Mr Sarpong expressed concern that the global revenue support to developing countries like Ghana had dwindled and thereby making it imperative for the nation to mobilize sufficient domestic revenue to prosecute its development agenda.</p>



<p>He urged personnel of the GRA to remain focused in their weekly and monthly tax mobilization drive, urging them to cherish team work and unity of purpose.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Vice President Professor Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang on Thursday urged women not to allow themselves to be intimidated or belittled because of their gender.</p>



<p>She made the call at the First Annual National Forum on Women in Government and Media, held at the Banquet Hall of the Presidency in Accra, on the theme: “Leadership, Visibility, Public Trust”.</p>



<p>The high‑level forum brought together distinguished women leaders, policymakers and media professionals to foster strategic collaboration, enhance representation and strengthen public confidence in leadership and governance.</p>



<p>It reflected a strong national commitment to inclusive leadership, institutional credibility and the advancement of women in public service and the media.</p>



<p>“We must refuse to be belittled. We must refuse to be intimidated. We must refuse to be shaped in other people’s images,” the Vice President said.</p>



<p>“We must have faith in ourselves. We must refuse for anyone to talk us down simply because we are women. We are proud of being women.”</p>



<p>Prof Opoku-Agyemang noted that women in leadership often work under heightened pressure and scrutiny. Yet, she said, national development required women to help shape Ghana’s direction—whether in Cabinet, Parliament, boardrooms, newsrooms, production studios or communities across the country.</p>



<p>She observed that visibility helps expand opportunities and normalize women’s authority, but said this must be supported by credibility, which is sustained by public trust.</p>



<p>According to her, trust was strengthened through accountability, clear communication and competence.</p>



<p>The Vice President noted that when media reporting was contextual rather than sensational, public trust is reinforced.</p>



<p>Therefore, the relationship between women in government and women in the media “must not be accidental; it must be strategic,” she stressed, because media shapes perception and perception influences confidence.</p>



<p>She cautioned that when gender issues are reduced to clickbait or when stories about women focus on superficial matters such as appearance rather than intellect, competence and outcomes, the space for women in public life becomes limited or insignificant.</p>



<p>Prof Opoku-Agyemang said women journalists and editors carry particular responsibility—not because women were morally superior, but because their presence brings perspective.</p>



<p>Women in editorial spaces, she said, are able to question framing, challenge assumptions and insist on depth.</p>



<p>“For many, the media is a classroom for governance, economics, health, public policy and more,” she added.</p>



<p>Women in media leadership, she said, help clarify complex issues, elevate credible expertise and expose harmful practices, thereby contributing to national development.</p>



<p>She also acknowledged the challenges of the digital age, where speed and controversy tend to be rewarded more than nuance, but insisted that standards must guide editorial decisions.</p>



<p>Emphasising that inclusive leadership was a developmental imperative, the Vice President said nations that integrate women meaningfully into decision‑making build stronger institutions, foster more civil governance and promote inclusive growth. “Women are not only beneficiaries of development; we are among its drivers,” she said.</p>



<p>Prof Opoku-Agyemang stressed that expanding representation does not equate to lowering standards.</p>



<p>She encouraged women in government and public institutions to lead with integrity, communicate transparently and mentor younger women.</p>



<p>“Let’s guide them. Let’s restore trust and let them know that we have their back,” she said.</p>



<p>She added that visibility should go beyond self‑promotion to include clear explanations of one’s work, enabling citizens to judge performance on substance rather than speculation.</p>



<p>To young women entering public life and journalism, she said their work would shape public understanding of power and potential.</p>



<p>She urged them to interrogate every story and decision with clarity and open‑mindedness.</p>



<p>“Ask yourself: Whatever I’m reporting, does it clarify? Does it provoke? Does it inform? Does it inflame? And to what end?”</p>



<p>The Vice President emphasized that democratic governance depended on informed citizens, and informed citizens depended on credible journalism and credible leadership.</p>



<p>She therefore called for a deliberate relationship between women in governance and women in media to strengthen democratic accountability.</p>



<p>“Let us commit to leadership that is visible, credible and compassionate. Let us build institutions that earn trust through words and actions. Let us shape national narratives responsibly and ensure that the story of Ghana’s development is told accurately, fairly and with confidence in Ghana’s women,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) is set to implement the Physical and Electronic Devices Act this year, Mr Anthony Kwasi Sarpong, Commissioner-General of the GRA, has announced.</p>



<p>He explained that enforcement of the Act would facilitate the deployment of physical monitoring devices at retail outlets nationwide, as part of reforms being undertaken by the Authority to automate the Value Added Tax (VAT) system.</p>



<p>The automation process began in 2025 with the passage of a new VAT law, he said at the closing session of a three-day management retreat of the Domestic Tax Revenue Division (DTRD) of the GRA in Sunyani.</p>



<p>The retreat was held on the theme: “Transforming for impact and growth: Focusing on VAT performance and compliance.”</p>



<p>Mr Sarpong noted that the legal reforms were expected to support the automation of VAT collection and enhance compliance. He added that enforcement of the Act would empower the GRA to monitor transactions nationwide and significantly improve VAT performance.</p>



<p>He disclosed that current VAT performance stood at about 40 per cent, leaving a gap of approximately 60 per cent. This means that out of every 100 potential VAT opportunities, only about 40 per cent were being captured, a situation he described as unsatisfactory.</p>



<p>“We are determined to change that so that VAT becomes a key anchor in our national revenue mobilisation,” he stated, stressing that businesses remained critical partners in the tax system.</p>



<p>Mr Sarpong urged taxpayers to cooperate with the GRA and honour their VAT obligations to enable the nation to generate the revenue required for progressive and sustainable development.</p>



<p>He expressed optimism that with a strong sense of responsibility, commitment, motivation and zeal, the Authority would achieve its tax targets.</p>



<p>Mr Sarpong added that the nation had provided the necessary opportunities and resources for GRA personnel and encouraged them to work diligently.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Director of the Presidential Initiative in Agriculture and Agri-Business at the Office of the President, Peter Boamah Otokunor, has criticised the New Patriotic Party (NPP), saying the party should be the last to comment on cocoa-related matters in Ghana.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Director of the Presidential Initiative in Agriculture and Agri-Business at the Office of the President, Peter Boamah Otokunor, has criticised the New Patriotic Party (NPP), saying the party should be the last to comment on cocoa-related matters in Ghana.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on Asempa FM’s Ekosii Sen, Dr. Otokunor accused the NPP of contributing to the challenges facing the cocoa sector.</p>



<p>According to him, cocoa farmers are appreciative of steps being taken by President John Dramani Mahama to improve the industry. He argued that members of the NPP who are criticising current cocoa policies lack practical knowledge of cocoa farming.</p>



<p>“They cannot act like saints. If anyone should talk about cocoa pricing issues, it should not be the NPP. Who caused it?” he questioned.</p>



<p>Dr. Otokunor further alleged that when the NPP assumed office under former President Nana Akufo-Addo, several benefits introduced for farmers during Mahama’s previous administration were withdrawn. He claimed cocoa prices were not increased until 2021, following public backlash, despite favorable international pricing conditions at the time.</p>



<p>He also stated that farmers were receiving only 25 percent of the Free On Board (FOB) price, a situation the National Democratic Congress (NDC) opposed.</p>



<p>Dr. Otokunor maintained that the most appropriate benchmark for cocoa pricing should be based on international market prices to ensure fairness to farmers.</p>



<p>“Akuffo-Addo didn’t increase cocoa prices until 2021, even after several public backlashes. At that time, the pricing was favorable, and they could have paid cocoa farmers three times what they were paying them. They were giving the farmers only 25% of the FOB price, and that was when we, the NDC, opposed it. We are saying that the best pricing index should be the international price,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>First Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Benard Ahiafor, has urged Members of Parliament (MPs) to exercise restraint and diplomacy in their remarks following the killing of eight Ghanaian tomato traders by suspected jihadists in Burkina Faso, cautioning against partisan commentary on the tragic incident.</p>



<p>Mr Ahiafor, who is also the MP for Akatsi South, gave the advice in Parliament on Thursday while presiding over proceedings during discussions on a statement regarding the deaths of the traders.</p>



<p>He stressed that the matter should be handled with sensitivity and unity rather than political point‑scoring.</p>



<p>Earlier, Reverend John Ntim Fordjour, New Patriotic Party (NPP) MP for Assin South, criticised government for failing to issue a travel advisory to Ghanaians on the security situation in Burkina Faso before the attack, noting that the advisory was issued only after the incident.</p>



<p>In a reaction, Mr Samuel Atta Mills, National Democratic Congress (NDC) MP for Edina Eguafo Abrem, argued that the previous NPP administration had failed to utilise $12 million allocated for the construction of the Pwalugu Dam.</p>



<p>He said the dam was intended to support irrigation for tomato cultivation and would have reduced Ghanaian traders’ reliance on tomatoes from Burkina Faso.</p>



<p>Mr Atta Mills maintained that completion of the dam would have provided local traders with sufficient and quality tomatoes, thereby avoiding the risks associated with cross‑border trade.</p>



<p>Reiterating his call, Mr Ahiafor said while holding government accountable was important, partisan attacks during a national tragedy undermined collective efforts to protect citizens.</p>



<p>He urged MPs to adopt a united front in addressing security challenges and safeguarding the lives of Ghanaian traders.</p>



<p>The House expressed condolences to the bereaved families and called for enhanced collaboration to address cross‑border security concerns.</p>

<p>Gomoa Ojobi District Police Command has arrested two notorious land guards and 12 individuals posing as National Security officers for allegedly demolishing over 20 houses at Gomoa Akotsi in the Gomoa East District of the Central Region.</p>



<p>The District Police Commander, DSP Asante, stated that more than 60 houses under construction have been targeted and destroyed by the suspects during nighttime attacks.</p>



<p>Speaking to Adom News, some of the affected residents said they were working on their sites when the land guards, led by Ekow Egyir, and the 12 impostors dressed as National Security officers stormed the area, armed with guns and handcuffs, and began demolishing their buildings without any official orders.</p>



<p>According to the residents, one of the victims quickly rushed to the Gomoa Ojobi District Police Command, prompting the swift arrest of the suspects.</p>



<p>All 14 individuals are currently in custody at the Gomoa Ojobi and Millennium City Police Command for further investigations.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Nananom of Gomoa Akotsi have appealed to the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) to ensure that the arrested land guards are prosecuted and jailed to serve as a deterrent to others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The government is set to reform the country’s cocoa sector with measures to promote domestic processing, improve financial sustainability, and strengthen governance.</p>



<p>Isaac Adongo, Chairman of Parliament’s Finance Committee, announced this at a press conference dubbed “Cocoa Sector Reforms and Matters Arising,” organised by the National Democratic Congress (NDC) Majority Caucus at Parliament House on Thursday.</p>



<p>He stressed the need to promote higher levels of domestic cocoa processing to create jobs, grow Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and make cocoa a strong pillar of Ghana’s economy.</p>



<p>“We want to ensure that cocoa remains a viable and robust pillar in Ghana’s economy.</p>



<p>“Our interventions are guided by the conviction that a financially resilient and well-governed cocoa sector is essential for the prosperity of millions of Ghanaians who depend directly and indirectly on cocoa, especially farmers in rural communities,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Adongo outlined proposed legislative reforms, including a new bill to be introduced in Parliament to restrict the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) from engaging in non-core activities, improve governance, restore financial sustainability and positive equity, and strengthen investor confidence.</p>



<p>He added that the government plans to convert GH¢5.8 billion in legacy debt to restore COCOBOD’s financial health and take over cocoa road construction to free up resources.</p>



<p>Mr Adongo, who is also the National Democratic Congress (NDC) Member of Parliament for Bolgatanga Central, reiterated the government’s commitment to supporting farmers and ensuring they receive good prices for their cocoa.</p>



<p>“We are certain that farmers are still better off under this administration than they were under the previous government,” he said.</p>



<p>According to the Majority in Parliament, the reforms are expected to contribute significantly to Ghana’s economic growth and prosperity.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as part of reforms in the cocoa industry, the government has reduced the farm gate price of cocoa from GH¢3,625 to GH¢2,587 per bag.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dr Agnes Naa Momo Lartey, Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection, has revealed that some women affected by the circulation of intimate images by a Russian national have become suicidal.</p>



<p>Speaking at a joint press briefing with Mr. Samuel Nartey George, Minister of Communications, Digital Technology and Innovations, she said the Ministry had deployed clinical professionals to provide psychological and emotional support to victims, their families, relatives and children.</p>



<p>“Several of the women have formally filed complaints and are receiving support from the Ministry’s Victim Support Desk.</p>



<p>“And some have been quite suicidal about the whole issue,” she said.</p>



<p>Dr Lartey appealed for empathy and urged the public to exercise caution when discussing or sharing content related to the case.</p>



<p>She assured affected persons of strict confidentiality and encouraged those yet to reach out for help to do so for assistance on toll‑free numbers 0800 800 800, 0800 900 900, and 0800 111 222.</p>



<p>Mr George cautioned the public against sharing, downloading or redistributing intimate images allegedly recorded and circulated by the Russian national.</p>



<p>“Any individual, including Ghanaian citizens, who have shared, rebroadcast, or redistributed the illegal material are also liable for prosecution under the laws of Ghana,” he warned.</p>



<p>He explained that under Section 67 of the Cyber Security Act, 2020 (Act 1038), the non‑consensual recording, publication, or dissemination of intimate images constitutes a criminal offence.</p>



<p>“Consent to a private encounter does not amount to consent for publication,” he noted.</p>



<p>Both ministers reaffirmed the government’s commitment to protecting citizens, reducing vulnerability, and ensuring that no one who violated the rights of Ghanaian women went unpunished.</p>



<p>They assured the public that the government remained resolute in safeguarding victims and pursuing accountability through all lawful channels.</p>

<p>Dr Samuel Kaba Akoriyea, the Director-General of the Ghana Health Service (GHS), has directed directors at the headquarters, regional and district levels, and all departmental heads, to enforce the wearing of approved uniforms and visible name tags by health workers in public health facilities nationwide.</p>



<p>The directive, issued during a working visit to the Catholic Hospital at Battor, aims to strengthen professionalism, accountability, and patient safety across the health sector.</p>



<p>Dr Kaba was at the facility to assess operations at its Cervical Cancer Treatment and Training Centre.</p>



<p>He explained that the measure was necessary to prevent impersonation and safeguard both patients and health workers.</p>



<p>The move follows a recent incident at the Mambrobi Polyclinic in Accra, where a woman allegedly disguised herself as a nurse and stole a baby after pretending to administer medication.</p>



<p>Dr Kaba said proper identification would help avert such incidents and rebuild public trust in the health system.</p>



<p>He noted that visible name tags also improve service delivery, as patients could easily identify health professionals, promoting transparency and professional conduct.</p>



<p>“When patients know your name and you are aware that they know you, you are more likely to be professional in your service delivery,” he said.</p>



<p>“This is an international standard. In hospitals abroad, nurses and doctors are properly dressed with visible name tags, and those in specialised units wear scrubs with identification. We must adopt the same standards.”</p>



<p>He added that identification protects health workers by deterring impersonators and enhancing security within facilities.</p>



<p>He also encouraged staff to wear GHS-branded attire when travelling for official duties, saying proper identification commands respect and recognition.</p>



<p>“Our uniform identifies us, gives us privilege, and protects us. We must take pride in our profession and safeguard its integrity,” Dr Kaba stated.</p>



<p>Dr Atsu Dodor, Volta Regional Director of Health Services, welcomed the directive and pledged his support to ensure full compliance across all health facilities in the region.</p>

<p>Dr Godfred Seidu Jasaw, the Chairman of the Agric and Cocoa Affairs Committee of Parliament, has assured tree crop plantation investors that Ghana’s legal framework is amenable to changes that would safeguard investments.</p>



<p>He explained that protection of smallholder farmers, local businesses and foreign investors was central to government’s agenda of growing the tree crop sector through plantation development and local value addition.</p>



<p>“Be assured that as we police the process, as we go with the management in every step of the process, as we go along with stakeholders and businesses in every step of the process, we’ll be amenable to reorient our legal regulations, our platforms for laws in this country regarding your investment,” he said.</p>



<p>Dr Jasaw, also the Member of Parliament (MP) for Wa East, was speaking at an investment forum at the 2026 Ghana Tree Crops Summit and Exhibition in Accra.</p>



<p>Mrs Patience Baffoe-Bonnie, the Director-General of Ghana Prisons Service, in a statement read on her behalf, said the service contributed significantly to the growth of the tree crop sector.</p>



<p>She revealed that currently, the service managed 688.5 acres of palm plantation and 10 acres of mango scattered across prison establishments in the country.</p>



<p>“These plantations contribute to internal food security, income generation and national efforts at expanding tree crop acreage,” Mrs Baffoe-Bonnie said.</p>



<p>She noted that the Service had prioritised mechanised agriculture and industrialisation and was in the process of securing land banks at strategic locations across the country for large scale farming.</p>



<p>Mrs Baffoe-Bonnie said departments had been created to leverage on government interventions and policies under the 24-hour economy programme.</p>



<p>With its vast land resources across the country, she said the Service, when properly supported with investments, mechanisation, improved planting materials, and modern farm management practices, could support Ghana’s green economy agenda.</p>



<p>Dr Vida Korang, a Senior Lecturer at the Catholic University of Ghana, called for more attention to be paid to the contribution of women in the tree crop sector.</p>



<p>She observed that women played indispensable roles in the sector, yet were often undervalued to being primary cultivators, farm labourers, processors and aggregators.</p>



<p>“We are the traders, exporters, and micro-entrepreneurs and the custodians of indigenous knowledge and sustainable practices,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Majority Caucus in Parliament has expressed alarm over the financial health of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD).</p>



<p>It cautions that the institution requires substantial working capital to remain functional. The concerns were raised during a press briefing on February 19, 2026.</p>



<p>Chairman of Parliament’s Finance Committee and Member of Parliament for Bolgatanga Central, Isaac Adongo, disclosed that COCOBOD faces a significant liquidity gap.</p>



<p>“COCOBOD requires over GH¢30 billion in working capital for it to survive, not the GH¢60 billion left behind. If you look at the accounts, you realise that there is a big hole in there,” he stated, underscoring the scale of the financial challenge.</p>



<p>In response to financial strain, COCOBOD has announced cost-cutting measures, including salary reductions for its executive management and senior staff.</p>



<p>Executives are taking a 20 per cent pay cut, while senior staff will forgo 10 per cent of their salaries. The reductions have already taken effect and will remain in place for the rest of the 2025/26 crop season, with the Board estimating savings of about GH¢5 million each month.</p>



<p>Government is also pursuing structural reforms aimed at stabilising the Board’s balance sheet. Parliamentary approval is being sought to convert a GH¢5.8 billion legacy debt owed to the Bank of Ghana and the Ministry of Finance into long-term instruments.</p>



<p>Additionally, road-related liabilities amounting to GH¢4.35 billion are expected to be transferred to the Ministry of Roads and Highways and the Ministry of Finance.</p>



<p>The measures come at a time of heightened pressure within the cocoa sector, marked by rising operational costs, funding constraints, farmer welfare concerns and increased public scrutiny over cocoa pricing and COCOBOD’s financial management.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian President Bola Tinubu and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz discussed deepening cooperation on security, power and infrastructure in a phone call, Tinubu&#8217;s office said on Thursday.</p>



<p>In a nine-minute call on Wednesday, the two leaders discussed reviving a stalled presidential electricity project in Nigeria involving the German conglomerate Siemens and Nigeria&#8217;s purchase of used German helicopters.</p>



<p>Tinubu told Merz that Nigeria needed help upgrading its power transmission network, the president&#8217;s office said.</p>



<p>A 2019&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerias-power-generation-rises-30-grid-overhaul-progresses-2025-03-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreement</a>&nbsp;with Siemens to rehabilitate transmission lines and power distribution substations, funded by German banks, aimed to achieve 7,000 MW of reliable power by 2021 and 11,000 MW by 2023. However, it has faced regulatory, logistical and financing challenges.</p>



<p>Merz said Siemens would deliver the work and that Deutsche Bank&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/DBKGn.DE" rel="noreferrer noopener">(DBKGn.DE), opens new tab</a>&nbsp;was ready to finance it, Tinubu&#8217;s office said in a statement.</p>



<p>Tinubu also asked Germany to supply used helicopters to boost reconnaissance and intelligence operations in the Sahel, where worsening insecurity is pushing south toward coastal West Africa.</p>



<p>Nigeria and Germany have had diplomatic ties for 65 years.</p>



<p>The two leaders also agreed to broaden cooperation on rail transport, creative industries and skills development. Merz backed plans for a Museum of African arts, the statement said, without giving more details.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A Tunisian court on Thursday sentenced lawmaker Ahmed Saidani to eight months in prison over social media posts mocking President Kais Saied, a ruling that opponents say signals an intensifying crackdown on critics.</p>



<p>Once a supporter of Saied’s policies against political opponents, Saidani has become a vocal critic, accusing the president of seeking to monopolise all decision-making while leaving others to bear the blame for problems.</p>



<p>The Reuters Inside Track newsletter is your essential guide to the biggest events in global sport.&nbsp;Sign up&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/newsletters/inside-track/?location=article-paragraph&amp;redirectUrl=%2Fworld%2Fafrica%2Ftunisia-jails-lawmaker-eight-months-mocking-president-2026-02-19%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>



<p>The member of parliament was jailed on charges of insulting others through communication networks, a judicial official said.</p>



<p>Saidani was arrested this month after he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/tunisian-police-arrest-member-parliament-who-mocked-president-two-lawmakers-say-2026-02-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mocked the president in a Facebook post</a>, describing him as the &#8220;supreme commander of sewage and rainwater drainage&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a violation of the law and an attack on institutions. How can parliament hold the executive authority to account if it carries out an unlawful arrest over critical views&#8221;, Bilel Mechri, a colleague of Saidani, told Reuters.</p>



<p>Saidani was elected as a lawmaker at the end of 2022 in a parliamentary election with very low voter turnout, following Saied&#8217;s dissolution of the previous parliament and dismissal of the government in 2021.</p>



<p>Saied has since ruled by decree, moves the opposition has described as a coup.</p>



<p>Most opposition leaders, some journalists and critics of Saied have been imprisoned since he seized control of most powers.</p>



<p>Human rights groups say Saied has cemented his one‑man rule and turned Tunisia into an &#8220;open‑air prison&#8221; in an effort to suppress his opponents.</p>



<p>Saied says he is enforcing the law and seeking to &#8220;cleanse&#8221; the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President of the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), Dr Kofi Nsiah-Poku, says the recent appreciation of the cedi is not enough to trigger immediate price reductions, as manufacturers are still recovering from heavy losses incurred during the period of a weak currency.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express Business Edition on Thursday, he explained that when the dollar surged, many manufacturers absorbed significant losses.</p>



<p>“At the time that the dollar was very high, I was making losses. Now that the dollar price is low, I have to recover the loss,” he said.</p>



<p>He stressed that the stronger cedi is only one factor in pricing decisions. “Some of the reasons why prices are not dropping as expected, even though the dollar has become very steep, is one of the reasons, but not the only reason,” he noted.</p>



<p>Dr Nsiah-Poku pointed to uncertainty about the durability of the cedi’s gains. According to him, industry players are not yet convinced that the economy is strong enough to sustain the currency’s current position.</p>



<p>“Industry still does not think that the economy is so robust,” he said.</p>



<p>He explained that Ghana operates largely as a credit economy, which complicates pricing decisions. Manufacturers often supply goods on credit and receive payment months later.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6OW8mOIRQKw?si=_kZLrZlnzDAbe08v" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“This is a credit economy. If I manufacture and give it to my customers on credit, and they pay me in two, three, or four months, and by that time, if the gain has reversed, what do I do?” he asked.</p>



<p>That risk, he said, makes manufacturers cautious about reducing prices too quickly.</p>



<p>“So we are very careful in trying to reduce the prices,” he added.</p>



<p>Beyond exchange rate movements, Dr Nsiah-Poku also raised concerns about high utility costs, which continue to weigh heavily on production.</p>



<p>“The cost of utilities is even high, even when the dollar is going down,” he said.</p>



<p>He argued that utility tariffs should reflect the stronger cedi, especially when costs are linked to foreign-exchange inputs.</p>



<p>“If the dollar is going down, we expect that utility cost should also be down, because we now have a higher cost, which is balancing the gain in the exchange rate,” he stated.</p>



<p>His comments highlight the delicate balance manufacturers face as they navigate currency volatility, credit risk, and rising operational costs.</p>



<p>While the cedi’s performance may signal macroeconomic improvement, Dr Nsiah-Poku’s assessment suggests that for industry, the recovery process is still underway.</p>



<p>For now, he insists, stability and sustainability matter more than short-term currency gains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The strengthening cedi alone cannot bring prices down, President of the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), Dr Kofi Nsiah-Poku, has said.</p>



<p>He insists that businesses are still grappling with past losses, high utility costs and fragile economic confidence.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express Business Edition on Thursday, Dr Nsiah-Poku explained that manufacturers who suffered when the dollar surged are now trying to stabilise their books.</p>



<p>“At the time that the dollar was very high, I was making losses. Now that the dollar price is low, I have to recover the loss,” he said.</p>



<p>He noted that many consumers expect immediate price reductions because the exchange rate has improved, but the reality for industry is more complex.</p>



<p>“Some of the reasons why prices are not dropping as expected, even though the dollar has become very steep, is one of the reasons, but not the only reason,” he stated.</p>



<p>Beyond exchange rate movements, he pointed to concerns about sustainability. According to him, industry players are not fully convinced that the current economic gains are durable.</p>



<p>“Industry still does not think that the economy is so robust. And this is a credit economy,” he said.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6OW8mOIRQKw?si=_kZLrZlnzDAbe08v" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>Dr Nsiah-Poku explained that manufacturers often supply goods on credit and may not receive payment for months. That delay creates uncertainty.</p>



<p>“If I manufacture and give it to my customers on credit, and they pay me in two, three months, four months, and by that time, if the gain has reversed, what do I do?” he asked.</p>



<p>That risk, he said, forces businesses to act cautiously when adjusting prices.</p>



<p>“So we are very careful in trying to reduce the prices,” he added.</p>



<p>He also highlighted utility costs as a major factor keeping prices elevated. According to him, the cost of power and other services remains high, offsetting the gains from a stronger cedi.</p>



<p>“And also the cost of utilities is even high, even when the dollar is going down,” he said.</p>



<p>Dr Nsiah-Poku argued that if the exchange rate improves, utility costs should reflect that shift.</p>



<p>“If the dollar is going down, we expect that utility cost should also be down, because we now have a higher cost, which is balancing the gain in the exchange rate,” he explained.</p>



<p>His comments come at a time when many consumers are demanding price relief following the recent appreciation of the cedi.</p>



<p>But for industry, the equation is not straightforward. Past exchange rate losses, uncertainty about the durability of economic gains, and persistently high utility bills are combining to slow the pace of price reductions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested at about 08:00 on Thursday, it had nothing to do with Virginia Giuffre, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse.</p>



<p>What led to him being arrested started with information that came out in the massive Epstein file release in January, around activities while he was a trade envoy for the British government. But it will not have stopped there.</p>



<p>It was emails in those files that seem to be between Andrew and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that led to Thames Valley Police getting involved.</p>



<p>One email in particular stood out. In November 2010, after Andrew had returned from a UK government-funded trip to Asia, he was sent a series of country reports relating to his trip.</p>



<p>Within five minutes of receiving them<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c99j01p1yjro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;he seems to have forwarded them to Epstein</a>, who had by this point already been convicted and spent time in prison for sex offences.</p>



<p>There were further email revelations from the files.</p>



<p>A month later, on Christmas Eve, Andrew appeared to email Epstein a confidential briefing on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand Province, Afghanistan, which was overseen at the time by British armed forces and funded by UK government money.</p>



<p>In a further email dated 9 February 2011, Andrew seems to suggest Epstein invest in a private equity firm he had visited a week before.</p>



<p>These will have formed the beginning of what today turned into a full investigation by Thames Valley Police. But detectives will have not relied only on the emails that we have seen.</p>



<p>In order to build a case they will have gone to the government and to the palace asking for emails that might explain what was going on. The palace said last Monday that it would &#8220;support&#8221; Thames Valley Police.</p>



<p>Detectives will also have done their own trawl of the three million documents in the Epstein files, and they will have asked for unredacted copies from the FBI or the US Department of Justice. The National Crime Agency is helping UK police forces with those requests.</p>



<p>So far we have seen only the tip of the iceberg, but detectives may have seen more of what lies under the surface</p>



<p>It is highly unlikely that the police arrested Andrew on Thursday on the basis of just a couple of emails people have seen within the Epstein files.</p>



<p>At this stage, Andrew has only been arrested. He has not been charged. He has always denied any wrongdoing arising from his relationship with Epstein and has not responded to specific BBC questions about the files released in January.</p>



<p>And a reminder, this arrest has nothing to do with allegations Andrew has previously faced from Giuffre, who said she was made to have sex with Andrew on a number of occasions in the early 2000s. An out-of-court financial settlement was reached between Andrew and Giuffre in 2022, which made no admission of wrongdoing on Andrew&#8217;s part.</p>



<p>The police released Andrew under investigation on Thursday evening. Typically with arrests relating to white collar crime, people are held for a few hours to allow for searches and initial questioning. Being released under investigation does not rule out further questioning at a later date.</p>



<p>Nowdetectives will have a big decision to make. This could take weeks.</p>



<p>Police officers with a crown on their cap badges will sit down with lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service and decide if there is sufficient evidence to charge the King&#8217;s brother.</p>



<p>If they decide to take the case to court, it will be called R v Mountbatten-Windsor, or in layman&#8217;s terms, the King against the King&#8217;s brother.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nollywood actress, Rosy Meurer, has reacted to backlash over her inconsistent claims about Tonto Dikeh’s failed marriage to Olakunle Churchill.</p>



<p>This comes a few hours after she denied ever knowing, meeting, or having any personal relationship with Tonto Dikeh when she was still married to Churchill.</p>



<p>The ex-couple divorced in 2017 over Churchill’s alleged extramarital affair with Meurer, who was alleged to be Tonto’s best friend.</p>



<p>Denying the allegation, Meurer, in a video, said she was the couple’s family friend.</p>



<p>‘”He (Churchill) and his wife remain family to me. We once hang out together before,” Meurer said at the time.</p>



<p>Four years after the couple’s divorce, Meurer got married to Churchill.</p>



<p>The news of their marriage generated controversy with people on social media accusing her of snatching her best friend’s husband.</p>



<p>Finally addressing the five-year controversy about her marriage on Wednesday, Meurer, in a new video on Instagram, <a href="https://dailypost.ng/2026/02/18/i-never-met-her-rosy-meurer-denies-knowing-tonto-dikeh-in-new-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denied ever having any relationship with Tonto Dikeh</a> in the past.</p>



<p>Following her new claim, Meurer faced backlash for not being consistent.</p>



<p>Speaking amid the backlash, Meurer in a lengthy Instagram post, attributed the previous video, in which she described Churchill and Tonto as “family friends”, to pressure from her management.</p>



<p>While claiming that she was forced to lie, she said, “You want me to hang on to the nonsense old video I made in fear due to the fact that I was so young and innocent.</p>



<p>“I was dragged into violence by force. With all the pressure then, PR team will make you say many things even if you don’t feel it is right. Right now whatever I say is THE REAL TRUTH. I am now older and wiser. No PR team can force me to say what they believed is better than my truth. If you like, bring videos of 1000 years ago. It does not change my reality.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nollywood actress Rosy Meurer has publicly denied knowing Tonto Dikeh before she married Olakunle Churchill.</p>



<p>Rosy Meurer stated this while addressing the viral report that she was Tonto Dikeh’s best friend.</p>



<p>It was reported on social media that Rosy Meurer snatched Olakunle Churchill, from her best friend, Tonto Dikeh.</p>



<p>In 2017, Olakunle was accused of cheating on his then wife, Tonto with Meurer, who was allegedly a close friend to the family.</p>



<p>In response to the allegation, Meurer who denied having sexual relationships with Churchill, stated that the couple were like family to her.</p>



<p>In the old video, Meurer said “I remain under big church foundation and he (Olakunle) remains family to me. His wife (Tonto Dikeh) remains family to me. We’ve hung out together before and I don’t see a big deal there. People should stop saying things that they do not know.”</p>



<p>Three years after the couple divorced, Rosy Meurer got married to Olakunle Churchill in 2021. Their marriage sparked controversy with netizens digging up the old allegations.</p>



<p>However, contradicting herself in a new Instagram video on Wednesday, Meurer who has been keeping mum since she married Churchill, denied ever being friends with Tonto Dikeh, stating that she has never met her before.</p>



<p>“These bloggers feed off lies. I can’t really blame them, but I blame all these gullible followers who just choose to believe lies and everything they see online. But today, I just want to tell you guys one thing, just this one time, so it can be on record.</p>



<p>“I was never my husband’s ex’s friend, not to talk of best friend. I have never met her. I have never seen her; she doesn’t have my number, I don’t have her number, and she’s like 8 to 9, 10 years older than I am. And I have read comments that I was her best friend or that she introduced me to her husband, and I snatched him, but it’s not true. If anyone has the proof otherwise, I dare you to bring it out.</p>



<p>“I was never friends with anyone. I don’t even know her. I met my husband separately from that other life that he has”, she said</p>



<p>Tonto tied the knot with Churchill in August 2015 and gave birth to their son, King Andre, in February 2016 before their messy divorce in July 2017 over alleged domestic violence and infidelity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Fresh controversy has emerged in the ongoing custody dispute involving Afrobeats star, Davido and his daughter, Imade, following the singer’s decision to withdraw from the case and subsequent public reactions that drew a formal response from the law firm representing the child’s mother.</p>



<p>Davido, whose real name is David Adeleke, announced late Friday that he had opted to discontinue the custody proceedings, insisting that he never sought sole custody of his daughter but only requested joint custody.</p>



<p>He maintained that no party emerged victorious from the case, describing the situation as a loss for the child involved.</p>



<p>“I never asked for full custody … I asked for joint custody. Nobody won, nobody lost but Imade … so I don’t know why some pple r celebrating. There’s nothing to celebrate,” the singer wrote on X.</p>



<p>Explaining his decision to withdraw, Davido alleged that events during court proceedings took an unacceptable turn, claiming that references were made to his late son, an experience he described as deeply distressing.</p>



<p>“I’ve decided to drop the case because … until she brought out her last card! MY DECEASED SON! THAT’S A NO NO! Lowest blow!” He stated.</p>



<p>The artiste added that his actions were driven by love and responsibility toward his daughter, expressing confidence that his efforts would be understood in the future.</p>



<p>“My daughter will grow up knowing I fought for her … let’s move on. One love!” he wrote.</p>



<p>Davido also took to his Instagram story to criticise the opposing legal team, alleging unprofessional conduct during the proceedings.</p>



<p>“I disgraced you in the courtroom … I was teaching you your work … and then went on to mention my son. Like I said in the courtroom, I pray you never go through what me and my wife have gone through ever,” he posted.</p>



<p>The online outburst followed earlier social media commentary by a Lagos-based legal practitioner, Maruf Muhammed, who had drawn public attention to tense moments during proceedings at the Lagos State High Court, Yaba.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="900" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937.png" alt="Lawyer fires back at Davido over social media harassment after custody case" class="wp-image-10032982645" title="Lawyer fires back at Davido over social media harassment after custody case" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937.png 720w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937-240x300.png 240w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937-112x140.png 112w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937-100x125.png 100w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937-200x250.png 200w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937-120x150.png 120w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937-339x424.png 339w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937-40x50.png 40w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure>



<p>“Davido in High Court, Yaba now! Come and see drama in court. The lawyer made 001 lose his patience during cross-examination o! Be you never so high, the law is above you,” Muhammed wrote, later clarifying that the matter before the court related to the custody of Davido’s daughter, Imade.</p>



<p>In response to the public commentary and what it described as harassment directed at its partner, the law firm representing Imade’s mother, Sophia, issued a strongly worded statement defending its conduct and warning against intimidation of legal practitioners.</p>



<p>In the statement dated February 16, 2026, the firm said its attention had been drawn to inflammatory public statements, allegedly orchestrated by a Nigerian Afrobeats artiste on social media, concerning a custody matter currently before a court of competent jurisdiction in Lagos State.</p>



<p>“That matter is sub judice. It will be decided by the court alone, on evidence and law, and no amount of media commentary will sway that process or our approach to the case,” the firm stated.</p>



<p>It stressed that it would not comment on the substance of the case, citing adherence to the highest standards of professional conduct, but warned that threats, intimidation or harassment of counsel outside the courtroom pose a serious threat to the administration of justice.</p>



<p>“However, if legal practitioners are to be threatened, intimidated, or exposed to harassment outside the courtroom for asking questions, testing evidence, or discharging their professional duty to their clients, then the very foundation of justice is imperilled,” the statement said.</p>



<p>The firm added that fearless advocacy remained essential to the justice system, warning that when lawyers were forced to weigh personal safety against professional duty, the rule of law was weakened.</p>



<p>“It will not begin with us,” the firm declared, noting that it would deploy every lawful measure available to resist any attempt to intimidate counsel or undermine judicial proceedings.</p>



<p>It further called on the Nigerian Bar Association and lawyers globally to condemn what it described as an aberration and a gross violation of the legal profession.</p>



<p>The statement was jointly signed by the firm&#8217;s Management and Board of Partners.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the custody dispute continues to attract public attention, with fans and observers calling for peaceful co-parenting, even as both sides maintain their positions amid heightened public scrutiny.</p>

<p>Afrobeats singer, Simisola Kosoko, popularly known as Simi, has sparked controversy after calling for capital punishment for rapists.</p>



<p>Nigeria is currently in a sexual assault crisis, with multiple rape allegations being reported in different parts of the country in recent weeks.</p>



<p>Reacting on Tuesday night, Simi passionately appealed to citizens and the authorities to put an end to sexual assault against women.</p>



<p>“I’m sickkk of this. Stop raping women. They need to castrate rapists and burn them,” she wrote in a fierce X post.</p>



<p>However, her suggestion of capital punishment for rapists sparked a debate, with many arguing that the same should be given to false rape accusers.</p>



<p>Simi maintained that she was advocating for rape victims and not victims of false rape accusations, which further escalated the controversy.</p>



<p>Shunning the outrage from her male fans, the singer explained that she was advocating for rape victims because almost all the women she knew had been “sexually assaulted at some point in their lives.”</p>



<p>She argued that it isn’t right to stop people from speaking against sexual assault just because of false rape accusers.</p>



<p>“How many of your friends have actually assaulted women as vibes?? Women are terrified to go out. Women in their homes are not safe either. </p>



<p>&#8220;Ask your sisters. Ask your female friends and your girlfriends. Ask your wives. We’re not all crazy. Stop raping women,” she added.</p>



<p>Simi also urged men to hold their fellow men accountable, claiming that men create the enabling environment for rapists due to their failure to hold others accountable.</p>

<p>The Africa Prosperity Network (APN) and Air Algérie Group have signed a Co-operation Framework Agreement in Addis Ababa, deepening collaboration to promote the “Make Africa Borderless Now!” movement and accelerate Africa’s economic integration.</p>



<p>The agreement reinforces the shared commitment of both institutions to champion the free movement of people, goods and services across the continent, a key pillar for the effective implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).</p>



<p>Recognising air connectivity as a critical enabler of integration, the partnership will support initiatives aimed at enhancing intra-African mobility and strengthening trade and cargo flows across Africa.</p>



<p>Under the framework, the two parties will collaborate to facilitate participation in the Africa Prosperity Dialogues (APD) and other high-level convening platforms designed to drive policy alignment and economic cooperation. The agreement also provides a platform for structured policy dialogue, capacity building and advocacy efforts focused on dismantling barriers to trade, travel and economic activity.</p>



<p>The signing signals growing institutional backing for the Make Africa Borderless Now! movement, which is pushing for the practical implementation of existing continental integration agreements.</p>



<p>Organisers say the movement is aimed at unlocking Africa’s full economic potential by eliminating restrictions that limit intra-African trade and mobility, ultimately improving livelihoods across the continent and within the diaspora.</p>



<p>Members of the public are encouraged to support the campaign by signing the “Make Africa Borderless Now!” petition and adding their voices to the call for a more integrated and borderless Africa.</p>



<p>The Africa Prosperity Network is a Pan-African organisation focused on advancing economic integration, sustainable development and shared prosperity through strategic partnerships and policy advocacy initiatives across the continent.</p>

<p>The Africa Prosperity Network (APN) and Ethiopian Airlines have opened discussions on a strategic collaboration aimed at accelerating the “Make Africa Borderless Now!” agenda, a continental campaign pushing for the full implementation of Africa’s economic integration agreements.</p>



<p>The meeting, held at the airline’s headquarters in Addis Ababa on Monday, focused on promoting the free movement of people, goods and services across Africa, with air transport identified as a critical driver of integration and intra-African trade.</p>



<p>The campaign seeks to persuade African governments to implement key protocols already adopted, including the Free Movement of Persons, Right of Residence and Right of Establishment Protocol, and the Single Africa Air Transport Market (SAATM), both adopted in 2018 but yet to be fully operationalised across the continent.</p>



<p>APN used the meeting to invite Africa’s largest airline to become a major partner in the movement, which was launched in Accra earlier this month. The initiative aims to mobilise 10 million signatures to demand visa-free travel for Africans within Africa, implementation of the AfCFTA Digital Trade Protocol, and the broader removal of trade and travel barriers.</p>



<p>Group CEO of Ethiopian Airlines, Mesfin, expressed strong support for the initiative.</p>



<p>“We would like to be part of this initiative,” he said, acknowledging that visa restrictions remain a major obstacle to travel across the continent.</p>



<p>“Visa is an obstacle to travel. But the primary reason for visa restrictions across Africa is security, however, security should be ensured in a different way than limiting people from free movement. Because whenever people move, they do so with money for tourism, money for investments, or money to buy goods and services,” he stated.</p>



<p>While noting that a fully borderless Africa may not happen overnight, he stressed that progress could be accelerated through deliberate collaboration. He added that greater freedom of movement would significantly boost intra-African trade and air cargo volumes.</p>



<p>Executive Chairman and Founder of APN, Gabby Asare Otchere-Darko, emphasised the need for African central banks and regulators to enable continent-wide mobile money interoperability. This, he said, would allow Africans to transact seamlessly across borders using their mobile money wallets.</p>



<p>Addressing concerns about security under a visa-free regime, he pointed to the example of ECOWAS, which operates a biometric passport system enabling member states to track movement within the bloc.</p>



<p>“So even if it is visa-free, as long as there is a biometric ID, you can track people. ECOWAS has that, and the long-awaited AU passport can do that too,” he said, adding that Rwanda’s visa-free policy for Africans demonstrates that security concerns can be managed without restricting movement.</p>



<p>He also raised concerns about the slow pace of ratifying the Free Movement Protocol, noting that only four countries have signed on so far, short of the 15 required for it to come into force.</p>



<p>“It is not right that people from outside the continent have more access to Africa and African economic opportunities than Africans,” he said, stressing that more Africans currently travel by air outside the continent than within it.</p>



<p>The engagement signals growing momentum behind the Make Africa Borderless Now! movement, as stakeholders push to translate Africa’s integration ambitions into practical outcomes. Both parties indicated that further meetings will be held to define the scope of the potential partnership.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Several countries which have signed up to Donald Trump&#8217;s Board of Peace have contributed more than $7bn (£5.2bn) towards a Gaza &#8220;relief package&#8221;, the US president has said.</p>



<p>Trump made the announcement during the first meeting of the organisation that many of US&#8217;s Western allies have refused to join, fearing the body originally meant to help end the war between Israel and Hamas may be intended to replace the UN.</p>



<p>The second phase of a US-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan includes the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza.</p>



<p>It &#8220;looks like&#8221; Hamas would disarm, Trump told participants. However, there are few signs of the Palestinian group disarming. Gazans say it is extending its control over the Strip.</p>



<p>Speaking as the Board of Peace convened on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had &#8220;agreed with our ally the US there will be no reconstruction of Gaza before the demilitarisation of Gaza&#8221;.</p>



<p>The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p>



<p>Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 72,000 people have been killed, according to the territory&#8217;s Hamas-run health ministry.</p>



<p>The enclave&#8217;s economy is in ruins, with its buildings and infrastructure largely destroyed. The UN estimates the cost of damage at $70bn.</p>



<p>Countries including the UK, Canada, France and Germany have refused to join the Board of Peace that came into being last month.</p>



<p>In an effort to address concerns that the organisation was meant as a way of sidelining the UN, Trump told the board&#8217;s first meeting in Washington that &#8220;we&#8217;re going to be working with the United Nations very closely, we&#8217;re going to bring them back&#8221;.</p>



<p>Gaza, the US president said, was &#8220;no longer a hotbed of radicalism and terror&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;And to end that, we have today, and I&#8217;m pleased to announce that Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait have all contributed more than $7bn toward the relief package&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every dollar spent is an investment in stability,&#8221; he said, adding that the UN would contribute $2bn for humanitarian assistance, while football body Fifa would raise $75m for soccer-related projects in the Strip.</p>



<p>Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician who has been given the title of high representative for Gaza as part of the board, said the process of recruiting a new transitional Palestinian police force had begun and &#8220;just in the first few hours we have 2,000 people who have applied&#8221;.</p>



<p>But both Israel and the US have insisted that the force is not drawn from the existing Hamas-controlled police without stringent vetting, nor do they want it simply made up of the security forces of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.</p>



<p>That means starting from scratch, and the task is daunting.</p>



<p>Mladenov has previously said the Palestinian police force must by the primary security agency in Gaza, assisted by the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), and not vice-versa.</p>



<p>According to the US plan, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas.</p>



<p>But Mladenov said there is little evidence such a force could yet oversee the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian factions.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, there was no indication at the meeting that Hamas was prepared to hand over its weapons, despite Trump&#8217;s combination of optimism and threat on this point.</p>



<p>So far, Hamas has publicly appeared to make handing over weapons contingent on &#8211; at least &#8211; Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p>



<p>Progress on this issue is critical because none of Trump&#8217;s proposals for reconstruction and governance can take place without a security force on the ground that has broad backing of the Palestinian population, given its role includes assuming a monopoly of force within Gaza.</p>



<p>The Washington meeting itself was characteristic of Trump&#8217;s approach to Israeli-Palestinian peace-making over his two terms &#8211; involving a future for Palestinians seen often through the lens of real-estate development and wealthy investor funding.</p>



<p>Meanwhile Israel&#8217;s leadership has been wary about some of Trump&#8217;s efforts, particularly the invitations to his board for Turkey and Qatar, whom Israel does not want to see take a prominent role in decisions on the future of Gaza.</p>



<p>Trump and his team have defended his unconventional approach saying it amounts to &#8220;new thinking&#8221; to try to solve the conflict.</p>



<p>However, Mladenov has warned that without rapid progress, Gaza will remain split into two territories, one under continuing Israeli occupation and the other under Hamas control &#8211; and also split from the West Bank, making a future independent state unviable and failing to secure either Palestinians or Israelis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Bono Regional Police Command has recovered five assorted firearms and shot dead a suspected robber during an intelligence-led operation in the Region.  </p>



<p>A press release issued by Chief Inspector Thomas Akeelah, Public Relations Officer of the Command, and copied to the Ghana News Agency, said police intelligence gathered on February 11, 2026,&nbsp;indicated&nbsp;that a gang had planned to attack traders travelling along the&nbsp;Dormaa-Gonokrom&nbsp;highway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;It said surveillance teams were&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;deployed to thwart the planned robbery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“In the early hours of February 12, 2026, officers advancing near a parked motorbike came under gunfire from nearby bushes. Police returned fire and, at daybreak, found one male suspect dead with an AK47 rifle beside him,” the release said.&nbsp;</p>



<p> The release said a further search led to the recovery of a sack containing additional weapons and ammunition, including two Baikal single-barrelled guns, a pump-action gun, and one Beretta pistol loaded with three 9mm rounds and 34 9mm rounds. </p>



<p> Police also recovered one AK-47 rifle loaded with 11 rounds of ammunition and 10 additional rounds, 39 rounds of BB cartridges, one dagger, a mobile phone, a Honda motorbike, a black mask and a set of talismans. </p>



<p>&nbsp;“The body of the deceased has been deposited at the Police Hospital morgue for preservation, identification and autopsy,” the release said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The Command assured the public that efforts were underway to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;and arrest the remaining gang members to face justice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;It appealed to the public to provide credible information to support ongoing efforts to enhance safety and security in the Region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Adabraka District Court has fined a driver 50 penalty units, equivalent to GH¢600, for careless and inconsiderate driving that resulted in the injury of a passenger. </p>



<p>Evans Amankwa admitted that&nbsp;he drove&nbsp;carelessly&nbsp;and negligently,&nbsp;causing&nbsp;harm to Edmund Wisdom Azumah Kwaku, the passenger.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Giving the facts, Inspector Irene Sackey said that on February 2, 2026, at about 2207 hours, Amankwa was in charge of a Daewoo Matiz Saloon car with registration number GW 920-20, travelling from Lapaz towards Kasoa.  </p>



<p>On reaching a section of the road at the McCarthy Hill Traffic Light whilst moving from the service lane to link the highway, he did not exercise due care and, in the process, entered the middle lane.  </p>



<p>As a result, an articulated truck from the Odorkor direction ran into the rear of the car. The impact pushed the vehicle into the opposite lane and crushed it into a trailer from the Kasoa direction, the court heard.  </p>



<p>The driver and the passenger&nbsp;of the Daewoo Matiz&nbsp;sustained injuries and were rushed to the Weija-Gbawe&nbsp;Municipal&nbsp;Hospital for treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the investigation, he was charged with the offences to appear before court, Inspector Sackey said, adding that he paid for the medical expenses of the passenger. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Kumawu District Police have arrested Kofi Dougan, a pharmacist at the Kumawu Government Hospital in the Ashanti Region, for allegedly assaulting a medical officer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dougan, who was detained overnight, had been granted bail after allegedly assaulting Dr Fred Twene Amankwaa at the Emergency Unit of the Hospital. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A source at the Kumawu Police Command said on February 15, 2026, Dr Amankwaa reported to the station and lodged an assault case against the pharmacist, Kofi Dougan.  </p>



<p>Wearing a torn uniform and with bruises on his face, Dr Amankwaa said he was abused by Dougan when he visited the pharmacy to pick up a prescription on behalf of a patient.   </p>



<p>He said being in-charge of the emergency unit, he attended to a patient on admission, but due to the seriousness of the case he decided to personally visit the pharmacy to pick the prescription. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complainant said Dougan claimed he (Dr Amankwaa) had no business picking the prescription.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The source said that led to a misunderstanding between the two, during which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dougan allegedly assaulted Dr Amankwaa, leaving him with a torn dress and bruises.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The pharmacist, according to the complainant,  was demanding outright payment for the services, contrary to management’s policy, even if the patient is not NHIS accredited, ” the source said.  </p>



<p>During the incident, some staff members of the hospital intervened.  </p>



<p>&nbsp;Dr Amankwaa was subsequently  issued with a police medical report form while the suspect was arrested and detained.  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dougan confirmed the incident but denied assaulting Dr Amankwaa.  </p>



<p>The Police are expected to put him before court after investigations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Samuel Nartey George, the Minister of Communications, Digital Technology and Innovations, has clarified that not all the women whose images were circulated by the Russian national had intimate encounters with him.</p>



<p>“Not all the women he publicised were engaged in any intimate encounter with him. In some cases, he barely met them at malls, said ‘hi’ and engaged them briefly,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr George was speaking at a joint press briefing in Accra on Wednesday with Dr Agnes Naa Momo Lartey, the Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection, to provide updates on investigations into the unlawful publication of intimate images.</p>



<p>He described the suspect’s actions as “evil” and said preliminary investigations by the Cyber Security Authority had found that, in several instances, there was no evidence of any intimate relationship beyond brief public interactions.</p>



<p>“In some cases, there is actually no video evidence beyond the mall encounters. However, he published their images as though he had intimate encounters with all of them,” he stated.</p>



<p>Mr George said the misrepresentation had caused serious harm and stressed that the suspect must face the full rigour of the law.</p>



<p>He noted that although Ghana did not have a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with Russia, the Government was activating international law enforcement mechanisms, including INTERPOL, to secure an international arrest warrant.</p>



<p>He explained that while the Russian Constitution did not permit the extradition of its citizens, an international arrest warrant would restrict the suspect’s movement outside Russia.</p>



<p>“As soon as he steps outside Russia into any other country, he will be arrested to serve his sentence. Our proactive action has helped protect potential future victims,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr George rejected calls for inaction, stressing that failure to act would encourage similar offences.</p>



<p>“As a government, we have a responsibility to protect our citizens and ensure that anyone who violates our privacy laws under the Cybersecurity Act faces the full consequences,” he added.</p>



<p>Dr Lartey, on her part, said the incident had caused severe emotional and psychological trauma to the affected women, some of whom had no intimate contact with the suspect.</p>



<p>She urged the public to exercise restraint and empathy in discussing the matter, warning that insensitive commentary could further traumatise the victims.</p>



<p>Dr Lartey assured the victims of government’s support, including professional psychosocial services for them and their families.</p>



<p>She encouraged affected persons to contact the Ministry, with a guarantee of strict confidentiality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Government has initiated legal processes to prosecute a Russian national accused of non-consensually recording and disseminating intimate images of Ghanaian women, even if he is not extradited to Ghana.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Samuel Nartey George, the Minister of Communications, Digital Technology and Innovations, disclosed this at a joint press briefing with Dr Agnes Naa Momo Lartey, Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection, on Wednesday. </p>



<p>He said investigations by the Cyber Security Authority and law enforcement agencies indicated that the suspect allegedly recorded private encounters without consent for publication and&nbsp;monetised&nbsp;the content online, charging fees and receiving payments through cryptocurrency channels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr George said the Cyber Security Authority was preparing a docket through the Ghana Police Service and the Attorney-General’s Department for prosecution in absentia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are also preparing through the Cyber Security Authority to present a docket through the Police Service and Attorney-General for prosecution in absentia in our courts,”&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He noted that in view of the transnational nature of the case, the two ministries had formally briefed the Russian Ambassador to Ghana, Sergei&nbsp;Berdnikov, and submitted a detailed report through diplomatic channels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr George said the Ambassador acknowledged receipt of the briefing and confirmed that the information received would be transmitted to the appropriate authorities in Moscow for further consideration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although there was no extradition treaty between Ghana and the Russian Federation, the Ambassador said the alleged conduct constituted a criminal&nbsp;offence&nbsp;under Russian law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr George said the Government was working with INTERPOL to activate international arrest warrant protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He explained that even if the suspect was not extradited due to provisions of the Russian Constitution, an international arrest warrant would restrict his movement beyond Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As soon as he steps outside of Russia into any other country, he will be picked up to serve the sentence,”&nbsp;he stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Lartey, on her part, reiterated government’s determination to pursue the matter to its logical legal conclusion to ensure justice for the affected women. </p>



<p>“The assurance we are giving all Ghanaians is that nobody will violate any Ghanaian citizen and go scot-free,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are going to pursue it. And that is the charge John Dramani Mahama has given us.” </p>

<p>The first detailed genetic map of cancer in pet cats reveals striking similarities with human cancers, potentially helping identify new ways to treat both.</p>



<p>Scientists analysed tumour DNA from almost 500 domestic cats, uncovering key genetic mutations linked with the condition.</p>



<p>Cancer is one of the main causes of illness and death in cats; however, very little is known about how it develops.</p>



<p>&#8220;Cat cancer genetics has totally been a black box up until now,&#8221; said lead researcher, Dr Louise Van der Wayden. &#8220;The more we can understand about cancer in any species, the more beneficial it is for everybody.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6670/live/f1568790-0da9-11f1-9fe5-57999fe11004.jpg.webp" alt="Getty A cat with a plastic collar rests on a wooden floor. The cat has chocolate fur and big blue eyes." style="width:840px;height:auto" title="Cats may hold clues for human cancer treatment"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Understanding the genetic basis of cancer in cats can lead to better treatments</figcaption></figure>



<p>The international team led by the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge&nbsp;</a>examined around 1,000 genes linked to 13 types of feline cancer.</p>



<p>They found many of the genes driving cat cancers are mirrored in humans, suggesting the two species share key biological processes that allow tumours to grow and spread.</p>



<p>The scientists say the household cat could hold the key to understanding certain types of breast cancer, such as triple negative breast cancer. Around 15 out of 100 breast cancers are of this type.</p>



<p>Cats develop this subtype more often than humans, giving scientists access to samples and offering clues to new medicines that might help in treatment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/36cc/live/647acf80-0d9e-11f1-8168-03d32f3820eb.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images A vet in blue scrubs holds a tortoiseshell and white kitten in their arms. The kitten looks directly at the camera." style="width:840px;height:auto" title="Cats may hold clues for human cancer treatment"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cancer is one of the leading causes of illness in cats</figcaption></figure>



<p>Almost a quarter of UK households own at least one cat, making the animal almost as popular as dogs as a trusted companion.</p>



<p>But while cancer studies have been carried out extensively in dogs, cats have remained unexplored.</p>



<p>The scientists say both household pets could give clues to environmental factors involved in some types of cancer.</p>



<p>They share the same spaces as us, meaning that they are also exposed to the same environmental factors that we are.</p>



<p>&#8220;This can help us understand more about why cancer develops in cats and humans, how the world around us influences cancer risk, and possibly find new ways to prevent and treat it,&#8221; said Prof Geoffrey Wood of the Ontario Veterinary College, Canada.</p>



<p>The research is published in the journal <a href="https://www.science.org/journal/science" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Science</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m always surprised watching children grow. Watching my own children grow is a constant astonishment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m always surprised watching children grow. Watching my own children grow is a constant astonishment.</p>



<p>Every day, I find myself overwhelmed by the simple, miraculous passage of their lives, from one stage to the next.</p>



<p>I wonder endlessly: what do children think about? What is happening in those little minds when they reach out, when they smile? What does it mean to them? Even observing the smallest milestones—the moment they lift their necks, the first hesitant reach of their hands, the way they sit up, steadying themselves, learning balance—I am reminded that life itself is extraordinary.</p>



<p>Then comes crawling—the first shuddering push of legs and arms, the little gasp when they realise they can actually move toward something—they erupt with discovery.</p>



<p>Every tumble, every hesitant reach, is an announcement: “I can do this. I am learning.” And then standing with support, holding onto furniture or your hands, rocking back and forth as if rehearsing the world, testing their balance.</p>



<p>And then—oh, the first step. That one moment is not to be missed. The sort of joy it brings, the laughter, the applause, the tears that threaten to fall—it’s pure elation. One tiny foot in front of the other, wobbling, unsure, and yet determined.</p>



<p>In that instant, the world feels impossibly vast and full of possibility, and you are there, helpless and amazed, watching your child take it all in.</p>



<p>Not forgetting those early babbles, the tentative sounds before the first words tumble out—it’s as though the world itself is teaching them how to speak, how to be, how to claim their place in it. Every new word is a revelation. Every laugh, every cry, every curious glance, is a glimpse into a universe I will never fully understand.</p>



<p>I watch my children, and I think: God is truly amazing. Because to witness the emergence of thought, the unfolding of personality, the raw, unfiltered wonder in a child’s eyes—there is nothing else quite like it.</p>



<p>It’s a reminder that growth, however small or slow it seems, is sacred. And that in the ordinary moments, the miraculous is quietly, insistently happening.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Founder and CEO of Jacob West Limited, Michael Kyei-Ayensu, has candidly detailed the unexpected hurdles he faced after relocating from the United Kingdom to establish his business in Ghana, revealing that adapting to the local business environment proved far more complex than anticipated.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Founder and CEO of Jacob West Limited, Michael Kyei-Ayensu, has candidly detailed the unexpected hurdles he faced after relocating from the United Kingdom to establish his business in Ghana, revealing that adapting to the local business environment proved far more complex than anticipated.</p>



<p>Speaking on <em><strong>Personality Profile with Lexis Bill on Joy FM</strong></em>, the diaspora entrepreneur said his early years in Ghana were marked by difficult adjustments, despite his prior success in the UK property and finance space.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0YUqqhpocRU?si=AJ3ZfL9dOksYhHcr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p><strong>High expectations meet harsh reality</strong></p>



<p>Reflecting on the transition period, Mr Kyei-Ayensu, who was a guest on the show on Thursday, February 19, admitted he initially underestimated the depth of structural and cultural differences between the two business environments.</p>



<p>“At the beginning stages…I didn&#8217;t expect this,” he said during the interview.</p>



<p>Pressed on what exactly surprised him, the Jacob West boss explained that Ghana’s business ecosystem operates very differently from the systems-driven model he was used to in Britain.</p>



<p>&#8220;It runs on emotions and culture, rather than systems and processes. And I didn&#8217;t understand that at the beginning stages.”</p>



<p><strong>UK playbook didn’t translate easily</strong></p>



<p>Before relocating, Mr Kyei-Ayensu and his brother had built a business in the UK, where structured financing, predictable regulations, and data-driven decision-making shaped operations. That experience led him to believe the same formula could be replicated locally.</p>



<p>“And I felt as though, as long as I implement what I&#8217;ve learned in the UK, in Ghana, I&#8217;ll be fine. Right?” he recounted.</p>



<p>However, he quickly discovered that success in Ghana required a different strategic approach, one that blended formal systems with relationship management and deep cultural understanding.</p>



<p><strong>Starting from scratch again</strong></p>



<p>Mr Kyei-Ayensu noted that one of the biggest shocks was entering a market where he lacked the institutional knowledge and networks that had supported his earlier ventures abroad.</p>



<p>“In the UK, we set up business with zero. There was no investment. It was ideas. And it became a business,” he explained.</p>



<p>Confident from that experience, he initially believed the Ghana move would follow a similar trajectory.</p>



<p>“So I said, &#8216;I can do this&#8217;. But then we understood the system [in the UK], and we knew where, if we started, we could navigate ourselves to get to where we needed to get to.”</p>



<p>That confidence, he admitted, met its toughest test upon arrival in Ghana.</p>



<p>“But in Ghana, we didn&#8217;t know the system. We didn&#8217;t understand the process.”</p>



<p><strong>Building Jacob West against the odds</strong></p>



<p>Despite the early turbulence, Mr Kyei-Ayensu has since grown Jacob West into a recognised Ghanaian real estate and property advisory firm, known for mortgage brokerage, property investment guidance and diaspora-focused housing solutions.</p>



<p>Industry observers credit the company with helping bridge financing gaps for many first-time homeowners and diaspora investors seeking property opportunities in Ghana.</p>



<p>Business analysts say his journey mirrors a common diaspora challenge, where the assumption is that technical expertise alone guarantees success back home.</p>



<p><strong>Lessons for returning diaspora entrepreneurs</strong></p>



<p>Mr Kyei-Ayensu stressed that, beyond capital and technical knowledge, returning entrepreneurs must invest time in understanding local business culture and regulatory pathways.</p>



<p>His experience underscores a broader policy conversation about improving ease of doing business and formalising systems within Ghana’s private sector environment.</p>



<p>Today, he says the early setbacks have become valuable learning tools that shaped Jacob West’s growth strategy and resilience.</p>



<p>For many diaspora professionals eyeing a return home, his story serves both as inspiration and caution: global experience is valuable, but local intelligence is indispensable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Abdul-Aziz Iddrisu, also known as Baaluuse, the alleged killer of General Constable Seth Oppong-Damoah, has been re-arrested.</p>



<p>A police brief issued on Tuesday said that at about 1230 hours, personnel from the National Police Intelligence Directorate (NPID), Accra, in collaboration with their counterparts in the Upper East Region, apprehended the 33-year-old suspect during a joint intelligence-led operation.</p>



<p>He was arrested at his hideout at Polego, a suburb of Bolgatanga.</p>



<p>The brief said the suspect and his accomplices, who were yet to be arrested, had been on the police wanted list for allegedly attacking officers at the Kariminga Police Barrier.</p>



<p>During the incident, General Constable Seth Oppong-Damoah was shot dead, while General Corporals Nyanku Charles and Abu Moro sustained fatal injuries.</p>



<p>The brief said Abdul-Aziz had been identified as a warrior for one of the feuding factions in the Bawku conflict.</p>



<p>A search conducted on three mobile phones retrieved from the suspect suggested that he and others, still at large, had actively participated in the protracted Bawku conflict and were allegedly involved in multiple killings.</p>



<p>Further examination of the phones reportedly revealed that Abdul-Aziz belonged to a WhatsApp group named: “Trusted Friends,” which displayed the image of Alhaji Seidu Abagri, a rival chief in the Bawku chieftaincy dispute, as its profile picture.</p>



<p>The group was said to be mainly patronised by members of the Mamprusi and Moshie communities.</p>



<p>Police said the suspect was seen in a video displaying a number of AK-47 assault rifles in a sack and pistols at a location believed to be in Bawku.</p>



<p>He was also captured in an audio message allegedly requesting more arms and ammunition to enable the Mamprusis defeat the Kusaasis in the ongoing conflict.</p>



<p>Information available to the police further indicated that the suspect and another individual, identified only as Mark, currently at large, were believed to be behind the importation of weapons and ammunition into Bawku.</p>



<p>The brief added that on December 29, 2025, the suspect and his accomplices allegedly planned and launched the attack on officers performing their lawful duties at the Kariminga Barrier.</p>



<p>Police said Abdul-Aziz went into hiding after the incident but was later traced to his hideout and arrested.</p>

<p>A 24-year-old&nbsp;motor rider&nbsp;has been remanded into prison custody by the&nbsp;Toase&nbsp;District Court in the&nbsp;Atwima&nbsp;Nwabiagya&nbsp;South Municipality of the Ashanti region,&nbsp;for&nbsp;allegedly&nbsp;killing&nbsp;an&nbsp;illegal&nbsp;miner at&nbsp;Manso-Moseaso.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plea of Benjamin Kwakye&nbsp;was&nbsp;not&nbsp;taken,&nbsp;and he will be brought&nbsp;back&nbsp;before the court on&nbsp;March&nbsp;03, 2026,&nbsp;as prosecution awaits&nbsp;advice from the Attorney General’s&nbsp;Office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Police Inspector Kwaku Frimpong, prosecuting, told the court presided over by Mr Robert Addo that the complainant in the case was a 52-year-old father of Prince Amankwaa Tagoe, the deceased. </p>



<p>He said the&nbsp;suspect&nbsp;and&nbsp;his brother,&nbsp;Paa&nbsp;Kwasi,&nbsp;together with&nbsp;the deceased,&nbsp;who was&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend,&nbsp;resided&nbsp;in the same house&nbsp;at&nbsp;Manso-Moseaso&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Amansie&nbsp;West District.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On March 03, 2025, Paa Kwasi’s money went missing, and he suspected that the suspect and his friend, the deceased, had conspired and stolen it, so he sacked the deceased from the house. </p>



<p>The deceased questioned&nbsp;the&nbsp;suspect&nbsp;about the whereabouts&nbsp;of the money,&nbsp;but&nbsp;this generated a&nbsp;quarrel&nbsp;resulting&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;physical&nbsp;fight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On August 05, 2025, the two met at a chop bar and fought again, and this time, the deceased threatened to kill the suspect. </p>



<p>However, the suspect took an axe and threw it at the deceased’s head, so he fell unconscious and bled profusely. </p>



<p>The&nbsp;suspect then&nbsp;fled into&nbsp;hiding,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;deceased was rushed to the&nbsp;Asuowin&nbsp;Health Centre,&nbsp;where he was pronounced dead upon arrival.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A report was made to the Asuowin police, and on February 13, this year, Kwakye was arrested from his hideout at Dadiesoaba in the Ahafo region. </p>



<p>In his caution statement, he admitted the offence, and after further investigations, he was charged and brought before the court. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Jacob West Ltd, Michael Kyei-Ayensu, has revealed that the devastating 2008 global financial crisis forced him to abandon a UK business and return to Ghana to rebuild from scratch.</p>



<p>Speaking on <strong>Personality Profile</strong> with <strong>Lexis Bill</strong> on <strong>Joy FM</strong>, the Ghanaian entrepreneur recounted how the credit crunch wiped out much of the progress he and his brother had made in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p><strong>UK success derailed by global recession</strong></p>



<p>Mr Kyei-Ayensu, who was a guest on the show on Thursday, February 19, said his UK-based property and financial services business was performing strongly until the global downturn struck.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0YUqqhpocRU?si=AJ3ZfL9dOksYhHcr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“Although we were doing very well in the UK… the latter part of 2007, 2008, there was this beast of a credit crunch, like the whole world,” he explained.</p>



<p>According to him, the downturn was swift and brutal, collapsing deal flow almost overnight.</p>



<p>“It was crazy. Like what we were achieving became less than 1% of what we were achieving,” he said.</p>



<p>He noted that while more experienced entrepreneurs had seen similar cycles before, he and his brother were unprepared for the scale of the disruption.</p>



<p>“But for us, we had no clue. We didn&#8217;t have any idea how we&#8217;re going to navigate this issue.”</p>



<p><strong>Heavy losses and business collapse</strong></p>



<p>The impact was severe. Mr Kyei-Ayensu disclosed that the crisis forced them to surrender multiple properties and lose significant equity.</p>



<p>“We lost quite a few properties,” he told the programme.</p>



<p>Pressed on the extent of the damage, he added, &#8220;Down in terms of losing properties, three to four properties with all equity.”</p>



<p>The operational slowdown was equally dramatic. Weekly business volumes plunged from about 20 transactions to just one.</p>



<p>“Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re doing 20 cases a week. It became one case a week. That&#8217;s how bad it was,” he revealed.</p>



<p>He attributed the collapse largely to tightening credit conditions in the UK banking sector.</p>



<p>“Literally, banks were pulling financial products from the market, which doesn&#8217;t allow us to brokerage.”</p>



<p><strong>Decision to return to Ghana</strong></p>



<p>Faced with shrinking opportunities and mounting losses, Mr Kyei-Ayensu said he and his brother made a decisive strategic pivot.</p>



<p>“It was literally from hero to zero. And it was tough. And then from that point on, our minds were like, let&#8217;s get out of here.”</p>



<p>Their conclusion was clear and immediate: “Let&#8217;s get out of here. Let&#8217;s try Ghana. Let&#8217;s try Ghana.”</p>



<p>The move marked the beginning of what would later become one of Ghana’s emerging indigenous real estate and property advisory brands.</p>



<p><strong>Building Jacob West in Ghana</strong></p>



<p>Since relocating, Mr Kyei-Ayensu has focused on building Jacob West Ltd into a player in Ghana’s real estate brokerage and property services space.</p>



<p>Industry observers note that his return coincided with Ghana’s post-2008 property expansion, driven by urbanisation, diaspora investment and rising demand for formal housing in Accra and other major cities.</p>



<p>Under his leadership, the company has positioned itself around:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Property brokerage</li>



<li>Real estate advisory</li>



<li>Investment support services</li>



<li>Market intelligence for property buyers</li>
</ul>



<p>Mr Kyei-Ayensu is widely regarded within Ghana’s property circles as part of a new generation of returnee entrepreneurs who brought diaspora experience back home following the global financial crisis.</p>



<p>Reflecting on the experience, the Jacob West CEO suggested the UK setback ultimately reshaped his entrepreneurial outlook and risk appetite.</p>



<p>The crisis, he implied, forced a strategic rethink about geography, resilience and long-term opportunity, lessons that continue to inform his business philosophy in Ghana’s evolving real estate market.</p>



<p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Lion DNA has been used to successfully prosecute poachers for the first time in the world, it has emerged.</p>



<p>Wildlife crime experts have only just revealed how they identified the individual animal from body parts found in a suspect&#8217;s village: they matched a profile in Zimbabwe&#8217;s lion database.</p>



<p>A blood sample had previously been taken from the male lion, which was being tracked by authorities in Hwange National Park, using a radio collar.</p>



<p>Two poachers were convicted for the 2024 incident and sent to prison in what is thought to be the first prosecution of its kind.</p>



<p>The details of the convictions and the role the DNA database played have been previously unknown.</p>



<p>Non-governmental organisation (NGO) Traffic, which works to combat the illegal trade in wildlife, has shared the details with us.</p>



<p>In May 2024, authorities in Hwange National Park became suspicious after a radio collar worn by a male lion stopped working.</p>



<p>Investigators and police traced its last known location and found a snare with lion fur attached.</p>



<p>After collecting forensic evidence, they questioned two men in a nearby village and discovered three sacks of meat, 16 lion claws and four teeth. These body parts would later be tested against the database, with the DNA from all of them matching the profile of the missing lion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d703/live/20c11050-fc42-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp" alt="TRACE, Simon Dures A man wearing blue rubber gloves, with his arms in a special air filtration cabinet is holding a white, liquid sampling device.  He is transferring samples from one set of clear plastic containers to another group which all have numbers written on them." style="width:840px;height:auto" title="Lion DNA helps convict poachers for first time"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A lab in Zimbabwe created a DNA database of all lions in the country</figcaption></figure>



<p>But possessing lion parts is not necessarily a crime in Zimbabwe.</p>



<p>Having them can be explained away as old, traditional ornaments or as coming from an animal that died of natural causes.</p>



<p>This has been an obstacle to prosecutions in the past.</p>



<p>But thanks to a breakthrough in DNA profiling, that&#8217;s now changed.</p>



<p>The lab generated a DNA profile from the recovered body parts and compared this to the profile previously generated from a blood sample of the lion with the radio collar.</p>



<p>The two profiles matched and scientists were able to identify the specific missing animal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/39bc/live/37c0d520-fc46-11f0-a8b8-bdd2c5f9bcad.jpg.webp" alt="TRACE, Simon Dures A man in a white coat stands to the right of the picture with his back to the camera.  He is in a dark corner of a room with walls painted in a light yellow colour.  The room has a noticeboard on the wall to his left beyond a door.  At the top of the noticeboard a sign reads &quot;Lab actions and Projects&quot;." style="width:840px;height:auto" title="Lion DNA helps convict poachers for first time"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The scientist was able to match the two DNA profiles</figcaption></figure>



<p>Over the last eight years, the Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust (VFWT) has received about £250,000 from the People&#8217;s Postcode Lottery in the UK to build up the DNA database of lions in Zimbabwe.</p>



<p>The scientist at the trust, who made the discovery, asked to remain anonymous for his own safety, but said:</p>



<p>&#8220;Before we had access to this technology, we were only able to do species identification, but sometimes that&#8217;s not enough.</p>



<p>&#8220;We can essentially match those claws or those products to the lion of interest that we are looking for.&#8221;</p>



<p>Within 10 days of the killing, the DNA evidence was presented in court.</p>



<p>Two men pleaded guilty and were given 24-month prison sentences.</p>



<p>The hearing was told the lion&#8217;s value was about $20,000.</p>



<p>Richard Scobey, Traffic&#8217;s executive director, said, &#8220;Countries now have the forensic capability to bring solid science-based evidence to court,&#8221; and that it will have a global impact.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/275d/live/fc23fb60-fc5d-11f0-9972-d3f265c101c6.jpg.webp" alt="TRAFFIC, Viv Williams On the left hand side of the image is a clear plastic bag which is full of lion bones and bone fragments.  On the right a display case contains lion teeth and claws with silver fittings for use as jewellery." style="width:840px;height:auto" title="Lion DNA helps convict poachers for first time"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lion bones are sold for use in traditional Chinese medicine. Teeth and claws are bought as jewellery</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is understood to be the first time that DNA from an individual lion has been identified and used to prosecute poachers.</p>



<p>Professor Rob Ogden has been closely involved in setting up the project and is co- founder of the organisation Trace, which promotes the use of forensic science in wildlife law enforcement.</p>



<p>He says the prosecution gives &#8220;a message of hope&#8221; and shows what can be done using a combination of training, research and development and forensic casework.</p>



<p>Recent figures suggest an increase in the number of lions being killed for their body parts which are then sold both as cultural objects in Africa and for traditional Chinese medicine.</p>



<p>It is thought the rise may be down to organised crime gangs also involved in the illegal trade in Rhino horn and ivory trafficking.</p>



<p>In Mozambique between 2010 and 2023, 426 lions were killed as a result of contact with humans with a quarter linked to deliberate poaching.</p>



<p>A measure of the scale of the trade is also the number of seizures by the authorities in recent years.</p>



<p>That includes 17 lion skulls found in Lusaka in 2021, reportedly en route from South Africa, and a 2023 seizure in Maputo of more than 300kg of lion body parts.</p>



<p>This breakthrough in DNA identification is seen as sending an important message to would-be poachers.</p>
