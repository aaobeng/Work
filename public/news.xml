										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ghana Accountability Forum (GAF) called for a forensic audit into the finances of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), as the nation’s cocoa sector undergoes structural reforms.</p>



<p>In that regard, the forum called on the government to set up an independent committee that would publish its findings to strengthen public sector transparency and accountability.</p>



<p>The GAF is a non-partisan platform that brings together civil society organizations (CSOs), anti-corruption advocates, media practitioners, youth activists, and concerned citizens to collectively demand accountability in public life.</p>



<p>It serves as a safe and credible space for dialogue, advocacy, research, and citizen engagement focusing on anti-corruption advocacy, public financial accountability, social accountability, access to information, media freedom, and whistleblower protection.</p>



<p>A statement issued and signed by Mr Raphael Godlove Ahenu, the Interim Chairman of the GAF said parliamentary oversight over the management of the COCOBOD ought to be strengthened too.</p>



<p>“In fact, accountability should not be politicized but rather seen as a national responsibility to safeguard Ghana’s most iconic agricultural sector,” a copy of the statement made available to the Ghana News Agency (GNA) stated.</p>



<p>It observed that a comprehensive investigation into the operations of the COCOBOD was required to hold authorities accountable, as the nation reformed her cocoa sector.</p>



<p>The statement indicated that: “The scale of financial strain, declining cocoa output, and growing concerns among farmers demand urgent scrutiny of management decisions, financial commitments, and governance practices within COCOBOD”.</p>



<p>It said “The current situation within the cocoa sector raises serious questions about oversight, accountability, and long-term sustainability.</p>



<p>A thorough investigation is necessary to establish the facts and protect the national interest”, saying that: “Reports suggest that the COCOBOD’s debt burden has increased significantly”.</p>



<p>It said the sharp decline in the nation’s annual cocoa production could have far-reaching consequences on rural livelihoods and the broader economy, citing factors like illegal mining, ageing cocoa farms, plant diseases, and inadequate support systems for farmers as major contributors.</p>



<p>The statement added that: “Cocoa is central to Ghana’s economy and identity and that calls for courage, transparency, and reforms, placing accountability at the heart of the sector governance structure.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Africa’s Global Bank, United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc, has unveiled a diaspora banking and investment platform designed to serve Africans living and working across the world and within the continent.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Africa’s Global Bank, United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc, has unveiled a diaspora banking and investment platform designed to serve Africans living and working across the world and within the continent.</p>



<p>The platform, launched in collaboration with leading ecosystem partners including United Capital, Africa Prudential, UBA Pensions, Afriland Properties, Heirs Insurance Group, and Avon Healthcare Limited, represents a major step in redefining diaspora banking beyond remittances toward structured wealth creation and long-term investment.</p>



<p>At the unveiling, which took place at UBA’s global headquarters in Lagos under the theme: “Beyond Banking: Powering the Global African Lifestyle, all the company representatives were on hand to showcase a seamless platform that goes beyond remittances, wealth creation, protection, and long-term prosperity.</p>



<p>Speaking at the event, UBA’s Head of Diaspora Banking, Anant Rao, described the initiative as a strategic shift in how Africa engages its global citizens.</p>



<p>“For decades, Africa’s engagement with its diaspora has focused largely on remittances. Today, we are moving beyond that. This platform represents a transition from simple money transfers to a financial ecosystem where Africans globally can bank, make payments, invest, protect their families, and build long-term wealth seamlessly,” he said.</p>

<p>Rao noted that African diaspora remittance flows exceed $100 billion annually, making them one of the most resilient and consistent sources of capital into the continent.</p>



<p>“Diaspora capital is not just a flow of funds — it is a strategic growth partner for Africa.<br>Our role is to provide a trusted platform that converts capital into structured investment and shared prosperity across the continent.”</p>



<p>The objective is to provide a platform that brings together offerings to address the diverse needs of the Global African, including Banking and payments, Investments, securities services, asset management, Insurance, Pensions, and real estate.</p>



<p>Through this coordinated ecosystem, diaspora customers can access financial solutions across multiple sectors through a single trusted platform, enabling them to manage their financial lives and family commitments across borders with ease and transparency.</p>



<p>UBA’s Group Head, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Alero Ladipo, emphasised the importance of collaboration in delivering a seamless diaspora experience.</p>



<p>“The modern African is a global citizen — mobile, ambitious, and deeply connected to home. Whether living in Africa, Europe, the Americas, or the Middle East, there must be a structured and secure financial connection to your home country. </p>



<p>&#8220;This platform ensures that Africans everywhere can remain economically connected to the continent with confidence and transparency.”</p>



<p>Partners within the ecosystem highlighted growing demand among diaspora Africans for structured investment opportunities, secure property ownership, insurance protection, and long-term financial planning.</p>



<p>United Capital showcased globally accessible investment products designed to deliver professionally managed, transparent wealth-creation opportunities.</p>



<p>Afriland Properties emphasised structured and well-governed real estate investment pathways for diaspora clients.</p>



<p>Heirs Insurance highlighted protection solutions for life and assets, while Avon Healthcare Limited demonstrated healthcare access and cross-border insurance solutions for families.</p>



<p>Africa Prudential and UBA Pension reinforced digital investment management and long-term pension savings solutions designed to support diaspora participation in African capital markets.</p>



<p>Together, the partners underscored a shared commitment to providing diaspora Africans with credible, transparent, and professionally managed financial pathways.</p>

<p>Rao also reiterated the guiding philosophy of Africapitalism, championed by UBA’s Founder and Chairman, Tony O. Elumelu, CFR.</p>



<p>He explained that Africapitalism is the belief that Africa’s private sector must play a leading role in the continent’s development by making long-term investments that generate both economic returns and social impact.</p>



<p>As Africa continues to position itself as one of the world’s most dynamic growth frontiers, UBA believes mobilising diaspora capital through trusted financial institutions will be central to shaping the continent’s next phase of development.</p>



<p>“Africa will increasingly be financed by Africans themselves, including Africans abroad,” Rao added.<br>“Our responsibility is to build the trusted financial infrastructure that makes this possible.”</p>



<p>“When Africa’s global citizens invest back into Africa, growth becomes inevitable,” he concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last week, eight Ghanaian traders were gruesomely killed and several others wounded when insurgents ambushed a community in Burkina Faso where they had travelled to buy tomatoes and other foodstuffs.</p>



<p>Ghana and Burkina Faso share a border and those of us from the Upper East know how closely knitted the border communities are. Citizens of both countries cross over on a daily basis for both business and family issues.</p>



<p>The traders’ trip there last week was, therefore, one of a routine governed by the decades-old trade relations between two African neighbours. In this case, it was simply to cross the border, access produce that Ghana does not currently have and return to sustain their livelihoods and feed the market back home.</p>



<p>But as fate would have it, that journey ended in blood, depriving families of loved ones and breadwinners. Indeed, similar journeys have resulted in deaths, but mostly from road crashes.</p>



<p>Rather than limit it to the typical Sahelian insurgency that it has always been, we must see this incident as a mirror held up to us, Ghanaians. When properly examined, the incident reveals the deeper consequences of our failure to deliver on the very policies that were supposed to make such journeys unnecessary.</p>



<p>While we do not know the details, the media reports from government officials showed that our compatriots, the food traders, risked their lives in conflict zones to cart foodstuffs, including tomatoes, which the nation lacks now.</p>



<p>This begs the question: what has become of the myriads of agricultural promises and investments that were announced and implemented in recent years?</p>



<p><strong>Human cost of failed agric policies</strong></p>



<p>Every November, Ghana’s dry season arrives with its annual certainty, starting with extreme cold and dryness before graduating to unbearable heat and dust. But unlike other countries that plan for such predictable cycles, we enter this period with agricultural scarcity that forces traders to look beyond our borders. It has been so since I was a child, growing up in the dusty footpaths of Bongo in the Upper East Region.</p>



<p>And while that happened, Ghana implemented a series of agricultural policies, which we proudly announced, funded, launched with fanfare but later abandoned.</p>



<p>Now, as we mourn our mothers, sisters and loved ones, it refreshes the painful question: What became of the many laudable initiatives designed to guarantee food security, especially in the dry season?</p>



<p>This brings back memories of the famous One Village, One Dam and the Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) policies and the nearly $1 billion Pwalugu Multipurpose Dam project that were once touted as game changers only to fizzle out, leaving behind scars of debts for the country.</p>



<p>In the case of the One Village, One Dam, it was touted as the solution to northern Ghana’s water and irrigation challenges. For those aware of the agricultural potential of the north, this sounded like the final solution but as is now common knowledge, the policy produced many dams that turned out to be dugouts, incapable of supporting even backyard farming during the harsh perennial harmattan.</p>



<p>Multiple media reports showed that in many communities, the dams dried up before the dry season even peaked.</p>



<p>Billions of cedis were also pumped into PFJ across the two phases, yet the structure of the programme, which was heavy on subsidies but weak on irrigation, mechanisation and market linkages, meant that the country remains vulnerable to seasonal shortages. Reported bumper harvests in plantain and other produce were not sustained, pushing us back on the cycle of scarcity.</p>



<p>Today, despite PFJ’s massive expenditure, Ghana cannot produce tomatoes consistently year-round, resulting in our traders continuing the perilous journey to Burkina Faso, leading to the deadly ambush.</p>



<p>Then comes the Pwalugu Dam. It was branded as the “game changer” and envisioned to provide irrigation for thousands of hectares, stabilise northern sector’s power supply, and unlock agro-industrial potential.</p>



<p>Years later, the site remains untouched by meaningful progress. There is no reservoir, no turbines, no irrigation canals and so no impact yet a huge debt has been incurred and borne by Mother Ghana.</p>



<p>Beyond these, numerous pilot projects, demonstration farms, mechanisation centres and irrigation schemes consumed resources and headlines but delivered little in sustained agricultural transformation, confirming our challenges with execution.</p>



<p>The painful truth</p>



<p>Analysing these lead to one painful conclusion – if these policies were properly executed to success, these perilous journeys would have been needless and our mothers might have just been saved.</p>



<p>If One Village, One Dam had delivered functional irrigation, farmers in Northern Ghana could be producing tomatoes now. If PFJ had strengthened irrigation and agro-processing value chains instead of focusing narrowly on input distribution, we could have a stable year-round supply. If the Pwalugu Dam existed today, Ghana would be exporting vegetables, not importing from conflict zones.</p>



<p>Indeed, our traders were in Burkina Faso because domestic systems failed their customers and they had to go through conflict zones in search of foodstuffs.</p>



<p>This is why we must now embrace this painful moment as a rallying point to not repeat our mistakes. Ghana doesn’t need dugouts nor rhetoric.</p>



<p>The country’s farmers need professionally engineered, climate resilient irrigation systems capable of supporting commercial agriculture.</p>



<p>The Pwalugu Dam cannot be left as a phantom project. Every abandoned or underperforming agricultural initiative must be audited, explained, and either revived or reprogrammed.</p>



<p>Food security is a national priority. When people must travel to conflict zones for tomatoes, it raises genuine questions about the state of the country’s food supply, and national security must be involved.</p>



<p>I am particularly happy that the matter has gotten the attention of President John Mahama and I am hopeful that he will ride on it to execute impactful policies.</p>



<p>There is no belabouring the point that the future lies in empowering commercial farmers, of which the president is one. Agri-processors, and investors need support, not solely from government-run programmes but also the private-sector and development institutions, including the World Bank and the African Development Bank.</p>



<p>We must create the environment for sustainable private-sector driven irrigation, mechanisation, and value chain growth.</p>



<p>Thus, while we mourn the deceased, I am hopeful that we will honour them by refusing to repeat the cycle of policies without implementation, by demanding seriousness in agricultural planning, by insisting that food security is a national non-negotiable.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Ghana has the capacity, the land, the people, and the ideas. And we have a President who has shown that he can mobilise the country’s resources to achieve the best for its today and tomorrow.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Plan International Ghana has urged journalists to move beyond sensational headlines and political propaganda and embrace responsible, rights-based reporting on children, girls and vulnerable communities.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Plan International Ghana has urged journalists to move beyond sensational headlines and political propaganda and embrace responsible, rights-based reporting on children, girls and vulnerable communities.</p>



<p>At the opening of a three-day media training on gender and children in Koforidua on Monday, Mr Eric Ayaba, the Head of Programmes and Influencing at Plan International Ghana, said although there were countless untold stories about children and girls across the country, many media practitioners often prioritised political and sensational narratives over development and rights issues.</p>



<p>It was on the theme: “Journalism with Purpose: Reporting Responsibly on Children, Gender, Equity and Vulnerable Communities,” held at the Eastern Premier Hotel in Koforidua.</p>



<p>“Telling the story of children and girls is in itself a development issue. It is also an issue of rights for people to know,” he said.</p>



<p>He expressed concern over reportage that perpetuated stereotyping and victim-blaming, particularly in cases of sexual and gender-based violence.</p>



<p>“The moment you begin to blame the victim, you are almost cutting off the most important information needed to tell the truth about the story,” Mr Ayaba stated.</p>



<p>He urged journalists to uphold the “do no harm” principle, stressing that reportage must not endanger or retraumatise children and vulnerable persons.</p>



<p>Mr Ayaba underscored the importance of informed and ongoing consent, noting that consent could be withdrawn at any time. He emphasised safeguarding anonymity to protect sources from further harm.</p>



<p>“As journalists, you are the bridge between reality and public perception. The goal is not just to be better reporters, but responsible reporters,” he said, adding that professional competence must go hand in hand with ethical responsibility.</p>



<p>He noted that Plan International Ghana had, over the past three years, consistently engaged the media to build capacity in gender-transformative reporting and would continue to invest in the partnership if it yielded measurable outcomes.</p>



<p>Plan International, founded in 1937, is a global humanitarian and development organisation working to advance children’s rights and equality for girls.</p>



<p>In Ghana, the organisation implements programmes focused on education, child protection, youth empowerment, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and gender equality.</p>



<p>Its collaboration with the media forms part of a broader influencing strategy to shape public discourse and policies affecting children and marginalised groups.</p>



<p>Ms Theodora Asare, Project Manager of the Renewed Women’s Voice and Leadership (RWVL) Ghana Project, highlighted structural inequalities and limited access to resources as persistent barriers to gender equality.</p>



<p>She said the project, funded by Global Affairs Canada with support from Plan International Canada, aimed to strengthen the capacity of 120 local, regional and national women’s rights organisations, youth-led groups and human rights defenders between March 2025 and December 2031.</p>



<p>With an allocation of about 1.9 million dollars, more than half of which would go directly to grantees, the project would provide flexible funding, advocacy support and research-based interventions to drive legal and social change.</p>



<p>“We want to enhance organisational sustainability. If your organisation is not properly structured, you cannot mobilise resources to serve women and girls,” Ms Asare said.</p>



<p>The project is being implemented in partnership with the Network for Human Rights in Ghana and AfriYan Ghana to support both established and emerging organisations, particularly those representing structurally excluded groups.</p>



<p>Ms Asare noted that strengthening feminist and intersectional approaches, promoting transparency and accountability, and investing in collective care and well-being were central to the initiative.</p>



<p>She emphasised the media’s role in amplifying research findings and policy advocacy efforts, stating that evidence-based reporting was critical to advancing gender equality and influencing reforms.</p>



<p>Ms Regina Asamoah, an award-winning journalist and communications specialist, highlighted practical safeguarding measures, including disabling geolocation features on mobile devices when covering sensitive stories in communities.</p>



<p>She advised journalists to obtain consent before taking photographs or videos and to use inclusive language, replacing terms such as “beneficiaries” with “participants” to avoid reinforcing top-down narratives.</p>



<p>Ms Asamoah also outlined several ongoing initiatives under Plan International Ghana, including education, digital skills, youth empowerment and humanitarian interventions, urging journalists to explore development-focused angles in their coverage.</p>



<p>The training forms part of Plan International Ghana’s broader commitment to promoting ethical journalism that prioritising dignity over headlines, safety over hate and development over propaganda.</p>



<p>Participants are expected to leave the workshop with strengthened skills in gender-transformative reporting, safeguarding and rights-based storytelling to ensure media coverage contributed positively to national development and the protection of children and vulnerable populations.</p>

<p>President John Mahama, he noted, had established a committee to investigate issues in the cocoa sector, promising that Ghanaians would soon see the consequences of the previous administration’s decisions.</p>



<p>Mr Asiedu Nketia made the call during a thank-you tour in the Twifo Atti-Morkwa of the Central Region.</p>



<p>He urged farmers to remain patient, noting that the current NDC government has prudent policies for them.</p>



<p>Central Regional NDC Chairman, Mr Richard Kofi Asiedu, encouraged the people to continue supporting the NDC in the next election.</p>



<p>The two visited various constituencies in the region to express gratitude for their strong voter turnout in the 2024 general elections.</p>



<p>The District Chief Executive for Twifo-Atti-Mokwa, Isaac Yawson, said the government would not overlook development in the Central Region, noting the imminent completion of two legacy projects, including a school building and market stores initiated by the previous administration in the area.</p>

<p>Parliament is set to consider a constitutional amendment that could allow dual citizens to occupy key public offices in Ghana.</p>



<p>The Constitution of Ghana (Amendment) Bill, 2025, seeks to remove existing restrictions that bar persons with dual citizenship or allegiance to another country from holding positions such as Ambassador or High Commissioner, Secretary to the Cabinet, Chief of Defence Staff, and Inspector-General of Police.</p>



<p>The Bill, which has undergone its First Reading, was on Tuesday referred to the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee of Parliament for detailed consideration by Bernard Ahiafor, the First Deputy Speaker of Parliament.</p>



<p>Proponents argue that the amendment would enable Ghana to harness the skills and expertise of its diaspora community, thereby promoting inclusive governance and national development.</p>



<p>“This is not about questioning anyone’s loyalty. It’s about recognising the realities of the world we live in today and allowing capable Ghanaians to take up leadership roles,” Davis Ansah Opoku, New Patriotic Party Member of Parliament for Mpraeso and co-sponsor of the Bill, stated.</p>



<p>The proposed amendment has attracted support from various quarters, with advocates saying it could strengthen Ghana’s democracy and enhance representation.</p>



<p>However, some critics have raised concerns about national security and the risk of divided loyalties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Vice President Professor Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, on Wednesday, urged public service agencies to ensure that recruitment, promotions, and appointments to positions are gender-responsive, transparent, and merit-based.</p>



<p>This may be accomplished by cultivating organisational cultures that prioritise merits, fairness, and inclusivity over tokenism and flexible working arrangements.</p>



<p>The Vice President, speaking at the opening of the second annual conference for Women in Leadership in the public sector in Accra, noted that the government was committed to implementing the Affirmative Action and Gender Equity law.</p>



<p>In line with that, the government has expanded the National Archives Insurance School to be more inclusive and financially sustainable, and has launched other economic empowerment initiatives, such as the Women’s Economic Resilience Initiative.</p>



<p>We have also launched other initiatives to broaden women’s access to capital, digital finance tools, and markets, while increasing women’s inclusion in strategic sectors and value chains.</p>



<p>According to the Vice President, these were deliberate policy measures and concrete steps toward a Ghana where women had fairer access to opportunities and could overcome barriers to their advancement and growth.</p>



<p>Prof. Opoku-Agyemang challenged female public service officers not to yield to biases and stereotypes, adding, “act with boldness, act with clarity, act with purpose.”</p>



<p>“To my fellow females, as I said, don’t be intimidated, it is not about making yourself in other people’s image. It is not about your hairline. It is not about your eyebrow It is not about the hair you do not like. It is about impact; it is about staying true to the values.”</p>



<p>The day’s conference is themed “Breaking Barriers, Building Impact: Advancing Women’s Leadership in the Resetting Ghana Agenda.”</p>



<p>As part of its commitment to promoting excellence in governance and advancing Gender mainstreaming in the Public Sector, the Public Services Commission is organising the Women in Leadership conference.</p>



<p>The Conference is designed to empower women holding Leadership positions, such as Chief Directors, Chief Executive Officers, Directors, managers, and analogous grades, in the public sector.</p>



<p>The Conference, among other things, sought to further enhance women leaders&#8217; capabilities and position the sector to lead in implementing the Affirmative Action and Gender Equity law.</p>



<p>Madam Lydia Lamisi Akanvariba, Minister of State in charge of Public Sector reforms, said comprehensive reforms to achieve Gender balance in staffing and leadership in the Public sector were ready to be rolled out.</p>



<p>She said the designation of Gender Desk Officers across all government institutions, agencies, and departments was a deliberate step to lead gender mainstreaming initiatives.</p>



<p>Earlier, Ms Nana Oye Bampoe-Addo, Deputy Chief of Staff, said the government was steadily moving towards achieving the targets of the Affirmative Action and Gender Equity law, and President Mahama had clearly demonstrated utmost confidence towards women’s leadership.</p>



<p>She urged women not to let stereotypes and discrimination silence them in their pursuit of leadership roles, noting that the law protects them.</p>



<p>“The law protects you to lead, stand firmly on it and work diligently”, she emphasised.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s foreign minister has said his government has stopped a study funded by the Trump administration aiming to evaluate side effects of the life-saving hepatitis B vaccine, including any links to autism.</p>



<p>The West African country, one of the region&#8217;s poorest, has high rates of hepatitis B, and the prospective study had drawn an outcry from scientists and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-funded-guinea-bissau-vaccine-study-undergo-ethical-review-africa-cdc-official-2026-01-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international health bodies</a> because only half the newborns in the trial would get the vaccine at birth. World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said it was not ethical.</p>



<p>Guinea-Bissau suspended the trial last month pending an ethical review. Critics had said it was being used to test theories linking vaccines to autism, long promoted by the U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. contradicts this, yet the scientific evidence supports it.</p>



<p>Foreign Minister Joao Bernardo Vieira said in an interview on Tuesday that the study had been closed, citing concerns raised by the scientific community and U.S. senators.</p>



<p>“It’s not going to happen, period,” he said.</p>



<p>The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention had approved a $1.6 million grant to fund the study after Kennedy scrapped the agency&#8217;s recommendation to give the vaccine to all infants at birth in the U.S.</p>



<p>The American Johns Hopkins University says that about 90% of babies exposed to hepatitis B at birth or in their first year of life develop a chronic infection, and 15% to 25% of these die early of related liver failure or cancer as a result.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">DANISH RESEARCHERS DEFEND U.S.-FUNDED HEPATITIS B TRIAL</h2>



<p>The study by researchers at the Guinea-Bissau-based Bandim Health Project, run by the University of Southern Denmark, aimed to enrol 14,000 newborns, specifically to investigate potential &#8220;non-specific effects&#8221; including skin and neuro-developmental disorders, including autism.</p>



<p>They note that Guinea-Bissau currently offers the vaccine only at six weeks of age, by which time many infants whose mothers have hepatitis B are already infected. It plans to introduce the dose at birth only in 2028.</p>



<p>Under the trial, half the infants would receive it at birth, the remainder at six weeks, as now.</p>



<p>Frederik Schaltz-Buchholzer, the lead investigator, said the discussion had shifted from healthy scientific debate to politics.</p>



<p>“Everyone will lose if this trial is halted, but especially confidence in vaccines and health research will suffer greatly,” he said.</p>



<p>He said the group still hoped that a new trial proposal might be accepted in future.</p>



<p>The Bandim project has operated in Guinea-Bissau for decades, and the researchers say their work aims to better understand the full impact of vaccines, both positive and negative.</p>



<p>Kennedy cited Bandim&#8217;s research to justify cutting U.S. funding to Gavi, a group that helps buy vaccines for the world&#8217;s poorest countries.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the U.S. CDC did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has signed an order directing that all oil and gas revenues owed to the government be paid directly into the federation account, as part of sweeping reforms aimed at boosting public finances, the presidency said on Wednesday.</p>



<p>Under the law, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation keeps 30% of oil and gas profits for frontier exploration in inland basins. </p>



<p>The presidency said those funds will now be paid into the federation account and appropriated by the government.</p>



<p>NNPC also retains 30% of oil and gas sales as operational costs and receives 30% of proceeds from Production Sharing Contracts. </p>



<p>Under the new directive, all revenues from these arrangements will flow directly into the federation account, while the company will instead receive the appropriated management fees.</p>



<p>Royalty payments, petroleum profit taxes and other statutory revenues previously collected and retained by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) will also be paid directly into the Federation Account. </p>



<p>The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) will also remit its revenues in full, with the cost of collection funded through appropriation.</p>



<p>Tinubu’s office said deductions permitted by law had sharply reduced net oil inflows and contributed to fiscal strain across federal, state, and local governments. The president also ordered a review of the law and established an implementation committee to enforce the changes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Residents of Sumbrungu in the Bolgatanga Municipality have protested on the Bolgatanga–Navrongo Highway, demanding the immediate construction of speed ramps to control the speed of vehicles plying the road.</p>



<p>The residents, comprising mostly youth, created barricades to prevent vehicles from passing, to press home their demands after several appeals to the authorities over the years fell on deaf ears.</p>



<p>According to the residents, many people have lost their lives through road crashes and pedestrians knocked down by over-speeding vehicles.</p>



<p>In 2026 alone, four accidents have been recorded on the stretch, with the latest tragic incident occurring on February 15, 2026, when a staff member of Bolgatanga Technical University, his visibly pregnant wife, and their daughter were killed by an over-speeding vehicle.</p>



<p>The Sumbrungu community lies along the main Bolgatanga–Navrongo highway but does not have a single speed ramp, creating an avenue for vehicles to overspeed and cause accidents.</p>



<p>Apart from having one of the largest markets in the Bolgatanga Municipality, which attracts traders from within the municipality and neighbouring districts, the university is also located in the community, making the area consistently busy.</p>



<p>Mr Albert Adongo, President of the Sumbrungu Youth and Development Association, lamented the longstanding neglect of their appeals for road safety interventions, including the construction of speed ramps, and said the protest would continue until their demands were met.</p>



<p>He revealed that over the years, past Assembly Members had written several letters to the Ministry of Roads and Highways and other relevant authorities requesting the construction of speed ramps on the stretch, but all efforts had proved futile.</p>



<p>He accused successive governments of neglect, stressing that the Sumbrungu stretch was the only section of the entire Bolgatanga–Navrongo highway without a single speed ramp, while other towns along the road had them.</p>



<p>He emphasised that the community had suffered enough fatalities and injuries from repeated accidents and could no longer remain silent.</p>



<p>He warned that if authorities failed to act urgently, residents would continue their protests and might be compelled to construct their own speed ramps to protect lives.</p>



<p>Mr Donatus Atanga Akamugri, the Upper East Regional Minister, upon hearing of the protest, visited the community and empathised with the residents.</p>



<p>He acknowledged that their concerns had previously been brought to his office.</p>



<p>Mr Akamugri added that was engaging the Ministry of Roads and Highways to address the situation.</p>



<p>Mr Emmanuel Antwi, the Upper East Regional Director of Roads and Highways, who accompanied the Regional Minister, assured residents that concrete steps were being taken to resolve the issue.</p>



<p>He announced that by Friday, the Safety Zonal Officer would visit the area to assess and zone the road for the construction of speed ramps, after which the necessary road safety structures would be installed in due course.</p>



<p>Following the assurances, the aggrieved demonstrators expressed mixed feelings but agreed to reopen the blocked road.</p>



<p>Traffic flow, which had been heavily affected for hours, gradually returned to normal as vehicles began to move smoothly once again.</p>



<p>Residents, however, maintained that they would closely monitor the situation and expect authorities to fulfil their promises to prevent future tragedies in the area.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Prof. Willian Kwasi Peprah, Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University in the US, says Ghana’s Gold Board is a good policy idea, but its biggest risk is not gold supply or prices — it is how the scheme will be financed.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Prof. Willian Kwasi Peprah, Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University in the US, says Ghana’s Gold Board is a good policy idea, but its biggest risk is not gold supply or prices — it is how the scheme will be financed.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, he said the Gold Board law appears solid, but the real test will be in how it is operationalised and funded.</p>



<p>“So the gold board idea is very good,” he said. “The law is good; the operationalisation is where we must watch it carefully.”</p>



<p>He warned that, without a robust financing structure, the Gold Board could become a future burden, similar to other commodity institutions.</p>



<p>“The financing model for the gold board also needs to be looked at a little bit,” he said. “So that gold board does not tend to the next Coco board, as we are discussing.”</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah explained that gold trading is driven by global forces and that Ghana must prepare for price swings, even if prices are currently rising.</p>



<p>“To understand gold trading, gold is treated on three main angles. One, when there is fear inflation, and then a currency hedge,” he said.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSCZdNE0E_o?si=adO3gewCnJNKrb8T" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>He noted that global uncertainty is driving investors toward gold, thereby contributing to the current price strength.</p>



<p>“We currently have fear so many things happening in the world, which makes investors uncertain. So that is why we are seeing the gold price really, really moving up,” he said.</p>



<p>He also pointed to currency trends, arguing that investors are shifting into gold as the US dollar weakens.</p>



<p>“We’ve noticed that the US dollar is devaluing, and that’s why we see investors moving into gold,” he said.</p>



<p>However, Prof. Peprah cautioned that Ghana must not treat the current high prices as permanent.</p>



<p>“If the price we all know it will still start to come down,” he said.</p>



<p>He proposed that Ghana establish a gold commodity stabilisation account, similar to those already in place for cocoa and petroleum.</p>



<p>“If the gold board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>He said Ghana should take advantage of current high prices to build buffers that can protect the economy when prices fall.</p>



<p>“So now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold, to put those monies into guard against,” he explained.</p>



<p>He advised the Gold Board, the Bank of Ghana, and the government to set aside the proceeds from gold sales into a dedicated fund.</p>



<p>“My advice to the probably good ball central bank and government is that whatever amount of gold sales that is coming that we are putting in our balance of payment account, and we create that fund just for gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah stressed that the stabilisation fund is distinct from the Gold Board’s revolving fund and must not be confused with it.</p>



<p>“Gold board, they have a revolving fund. &#8221; A revolving fund account is not the same as a stabilisation fund account,” he said.</p>



<p>He added that while Ghana’s refinery plans are important for value addition, the stabilisation fund remains critical.</p>



<p>“It’s good. We are doing a refinery to add value, but that commodity fund for gold is needed,” he said.</p>



<p>Regarding financing, he noted that the Gold Board is expected to rely partly on government support, even though previous commitments were not fully honoured.</p>



<p>“It has raised, getting money from the government of Ghana, which we know the amount they promised was not fully released in 2025,” he said.</p>



<p>He also noted that the Bank of Ghana is exiting direct financing of the gold trade, thereby increasing pressure on the Gold Board to identify viable alternatives.</p>



<p>“Bank of Ghana is going to exit from financing trade,” he said.</p>



<p>He cited a provision in the law that permits advance payments by gold buyers.</p>



<p>“I think, in the law, it allows them to take money in advance from whoever needs gold, and then be able to give them the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah warned that if Ghana becomes overly dependent on gold without safeguards, the trade balance could come under strain.</p>



<p>“If we feel on gold… our trade balance will move into a very struggling position,” he cautioned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A U.S. civil rights agency has sued a bottler and distributor of Coca-Cola products, accusing it of sex discrimination over an employee networking event that excluded men, its first lawsuit over workplace diversity programs since President Donald Trump took office.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://tmsnrt.rs/4azRiSl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawsuit,</a> filed Tuesday by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleges that Coca-Cola Beverages Northeast violated federal law by hosting an event for about 250 female employees at a Connecticut casino in September 2024.</p>



<p>The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is owned by Kirin Holdings a Japanese company. Coca-Cola is not a defendant in the case.</p>



<p>The case in New Hampshire federal court is an early test of claims by Trump administration officials, including EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, that many common workplace diversity, equity and inclusion programs amount to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trumps-anti-corporate-dei-campaign-faces-high-legal-hurdles-2025-12-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlawful reverse discrimination</a>.</p>



<p>Trump, a Republican, has moved aggressively to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-appeals-court-rejects-challenge-trumps-efforts-ban-dei-2026-02-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eradicate DEI</a>&nbsp;from the federal government, the private sector and higher education, saying it is discriminatory and erodes merit-based decision-making.</p>



<p>DEI encompasses a broad range of programs and policies that supporters say promote fair treatment and full participation for groups that have historically been underrepresented or have faced discrimination.</p>



<p>The commission is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/nike-facing-us-probe-over-alleged-discrimination-against-white-workers-2026-02-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigating Nike</a> and Northwestern Mutual Insurance for allegedly discriminating against white workers<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> and, last year, demanded that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-civil-rights-agency-warns-law-firms-over-workplace-dei-policies-2025-03-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 major law firms</a> turn over information about</span> their DEI policies.</p>



<p>But the lawsuit against the Coca-Cola bottler is the EEOC&#8217;s first to allege that a diversity-focused workplace program is unlawful.</p>



<p>The EEOC&#8217;s acting general counsel, Catherine Eschbach, said that excluding a protected class of workers, such as men, from any employer-sponsored event is illegal.</p>



<p>&#8220;The EEOC remains committed to ensuring that all employees – men and women alike – enjoy equal access to all aspects of their employment,&#8221; Eschbach said in a statement.</p>



<p>The commission said in the lawsuit that the two-day networking event featured a social reception, team-building exercises, recreational activities and speakers, including a top executive at Coca-Cola.</p>



<p>Coca-Cola Beverages Northeast excused female employees who attended the event from their normal work duties without requiring them to use paid time off, and covered all of their hotel room charges, according to the lawsuit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A German appeals court has ordered the social media platform X to provide vetted researchers with access to publicly available data linked to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarian-president-sets-april-12-date-parliamentary-election-2026-01-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hungary&#8217;s April 12 election</a>, setting a precedent for enforcing EU digital transparency rules ahead of a contentious vote.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are open-sourcing our algorithm. Not sure what more they want,&#8221; Elon Musk wrote in reaction on X. Musk&#8217;s startup xAI owns X.</p>



<p>The Berlin Court of Appeal&#8217;s ruling is not related to the type of algorithm used, but it orders X to share information, including the reach and engagement of posts related to Hungary&#8217;s parliamentary election, Democracy Reporting International, one of the two plaintiffs, said late on Tuesday.</p>



<p>A court spokesperson said on Wednesday that the ruling takes immediate effect.</p>



<p>The decision is seen as a milestone in implementing the EU&#8217;s Digital Services Act, a regulation that requires major online platforms to provide researchers with access to data to monitor risks, including disinformation, hate speech, and election manipulation.</p>



<p>X did not respond to Reuters&#8217; requests for comment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">PRECEDENT FOR RESEARCHER ACCESS ESTABLISHED</h2>



<p>The plaintiffs &#8211; DRI and the Society for Civil Rights (GFF) &#8211; previously failed to obtain similar data from X for Germany&#8217;s 2025 federal election.</p>



<p>In the current case, a lower court ruled that jurisdiction lay in Ireland, where X has its EU headquarters.</p>



<p>However, the Berlin appeals court revisited the issue, determining that German courts could act when there was a local problem, such as when German-based researchers were denied crucial data for public-interest work.</p>



<p>Ruling in favour of the two NGOs, the court said X&#8217;s noncompliance affected their ability to conduct research in Germany.</p>



<p>&#8220;No appeal can be lodged against the decision,&#8221; said Joschka Selinger, a lawyer for GFF, adding that it could be enforced through penalty payments if X fails to comply.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HUNGARY ELECTION PUSHES TRANSPARENCY DEBATE</h2>



<p>Hungary&#8217;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban is facing the biggest challenge to his rule since his Fidesz party took power in 2010 as the centre-right opposition&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarys-tisza-party-leads-pre-election-poll-far-right-party-course-parliament-2026-02-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tisza party leads</a>&nbsp;in most opinion polls. Pro-government pollsters, however, put Fidesz in the lead, while many voters remain undecided.</p>



<p>Previous elections in Hungary have been overshadowed by reports of media bias and disinformation.</p>



<p>The Hungarian government did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Wednesday.</p>



<p>DRI contended that the court order would lower barriers for civil society groups across Europe seeking to enforce digital rights through national courts.</p>



<p>Observers view the decision as a signal to major platforms operating under the DSA that failure to facilitate researcher access could lead to legal consequences in EU member states.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University in the United States, Prof William Kwasi Peprah, has urged Ghana to use the current surge in gold prices to protect the economy against future shocks.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, Prof Peprah said Ghana must take advantage of what he described as a windfall and set up a dedicated gold stabilisation fund to cushion the country when prices fall.</p>



<p>“So now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold, to put in that money to guard against… that will come in,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah described the Gold Board concept as a good idea but warned that, for it to work effectively, it must be backed by a clear stabilisation account, similar to those already in place for cocoa and petroleum.</p>



<p>“So the gold board idea is very good. However… the one that exists is a cocoa one, and we also have one for petroleum. If the gold board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold,” he stressed.</p>



<p>He explained that gold prices are rising due to global uncertainty and investor behaviour. He said gold is traded based on three main angles: fear, inflation, and currency hedging.</p>



<p>“One, when there is fear… and then a currency hedge… we currently have fear, so many things happening in the world, which makes investors uncertain. So that is why we are seeing the gold price really, really moving up,” he said.</p>



<p>He also pointed to currency pressures as another driver of the current rally.</p>



<p>“We’ve noticed that the US dollar is devaluing, and that’s why we see investors moving into gold,” he added.</p>



<p>While he acknowledged that gold has historically risen over time, he cautioned that prices can still fall and Ghana must prepare for that possibility.</p>



<p>“The law is good, the operationalisation is where we must watch it carefully and make sure that… the price… will still start to come down,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said the stabilisation fund should be designed to support the gold industry and the broader economy when gold prices eventually decline.</p>



<p>“My advice… is that whatever amount of gold sales that is coming that we are putting in our balance of payment account, and we create that fund just for gold, and then to make sure that when the price starts to drop, we’ll be able to use it support the gold industry in Ghana,” he said.</p>



<p>He also raised concerns about how the Gold Board will be financed, warning that weak financing could create future challenges.</p>



<p>“The financing model for the gold board also needs to be looked at a little bit,” he said.</p>



<p>He noted that the Gold Board has relied on government funding, but those releases have been inconsistent.</p>



<p>“It has raised, getting money from the government of Ghana, which we know the amount they promised was not fully released in 2025,” he said.</p>



<p>He added that with the Bank of Ghana set to exit financing the gold trade, the Gold Board must carefully review the alternative model provided in the law.</p>



<p>“In the law, it allows them to take money in advance from whoever needs gold, and then be able to give them the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah warned that without the right structure, the Gold Board could risk becoming another troubled commodity institution.</p>



<p>“So that gold board does not tend to the next Coco board,” he cautioned.</p>



<p>He concluded that Ghana must avoid overdependence on gold in the absence of a robust buffer, particularly given the volatility of other commodities.</p>



<p>“If we feel on gold… our trade balance will move into a very struggling position,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University in the US has urged Ghana to urgently establish a Gold Stabilisation Fund to protect the economy against future shocks from falling gold prices.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, Prof. William Kwasi Peprah said Ghana’s new Gold Board framework is a good idea but warned that, without a dedicated stabilisation account, the country could face serious difficulties when the current price boom cools.</p>



<p>“The gold board idea is very good,” he said, adding that if the structure is to succeed, Ghana must take lessons from existing commodity stabilisation models. </p>



<p>“As I talked about the commodity stabilisation account… the one that exists is a cocoa one, and we also have one for petroleum. Exactly. If the gold board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold.”</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah explained that gold prices are being driven up by global uncertainty and investor behaviour, and that Ghana should not assume that high prices will persist. </p>



<p>He noted that gold is traded globally from three key perspectives: fear, inflation, and currency hedging.</p>



<p>“We currently have fear… so many things happening in the world which makes investors uncertain,” he said, arguing that this uncertainty is driving gold prices sharply upward. </p>



<p>He also linked the trend to inflation expectations and currency movements. “We’ve noticed that the US dollar is devaluing, and that’s why we see investors moving into gold.”</p>



<p>While he described Ghana’s law on the Gold Board as sound, he cautioned that the real test lies in implementation. </p>

<p>“To me, the law is good; the operationalisation is where we must watch it carefully,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah said the current period should be treated as a rare opportunity to save and prepare. </p>



<p>“So now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold, to put in that money to guard against… that will come in.”</p>



<p>He advised that proceeds from gold sales should be used not only for immediate balance-of-payments support but also for future stability. </p>



<p>“Whatever amount of gold sales that is coming that we are putting in our balance of payment account, and we create that fund just for gold,” he said, explaining that the fund would help Ghana support the industry and the economy when prices fall.</p>



<p>He also welcomed efforts to add value locally. “It’s good. We are doing a refinery to add on value,” he said, but insisted that a stabilisation fund remains essential.</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah further raised concerns about the Gold Boardis financing, warning that it must not become another struggling commodity institution. “The financing model for the gold board also needs to be looked at a little bit,” he said.</p>



<p>He noted that the Gold Board has relied on government support, but that the promised funds have not been fully disbursed. </p>



<p>“It has raised, getting money from the government of Ghana, which we know the amount they promised were not fully released in 2025,” he said.</p>



<p>He also noted that the Bank of Ghana is expected to exit financing for the gold trade, making it urgent for the Gold Board to adopt sustainable funding options. </p>



<p>“Bank of Ghana is going to exit from financing the gold trade,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah suggested that the law already provides an alternative approach. “It allows them to take money in advance from whoever needs gold, and then be able to give them the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>He stressed that Ghana must not confuse a revolving fund with a stabilisation fund. </p>



<p>“Gold board, they have a revolving fund. Revolving fund account is not the same as stabilisation fund account,” he said.</p>



<p>He warned that if Ghana fails to plan now, the country could be exposed when prices eventually decline. “If we fail on gold… our trade balance will move into a very struggling position,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An associate professor of Finance at Andrews University in the U.S. has endorsed the Gold Board initiative but warned that the country must prepare for a possible downturn in global gold prices.</p>



<p>Prof Willian Kwasi Peprah, speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, said, “So the gold board idea is very good.” </p>



<p>However, he stressed that the policy&#8217;s success will depend on how it is operationalised and on whether Ghana builds buffers to manage future shocks.</p>



<p>He pointed to the country’s existing commodity stabilisation accounts for cocoa and petroleum and argued that gold must not be left out.</p>



<p>“If the gold board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah explained that while gold prices have been rising, history shows that such price movements are not permanent, and Ghana must plan for a decline.</p>



<p>“We know from history, gold price… has always been going up… [but] we must watch it carefully and make sure that… the price… will still start to come down,” he said.</p>



<p>He said that gold trading is driven primarily by three factors: fear, inflation, and currency hedging.</p>



<p>“We currently have fear… so many things happening in the world, which makes investors uncertain. So that is why we are seeing the gold price really, really moving up,” he said.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSCZdNE0E_o?si=adO3gewCnJNKrb8T" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>On inflation, he noted that “The IMF and World Bank projects are being a little bit moderate.” He added that currency movements are also prompting investors to allocate to gold.</p>



<p>“We’ve noticed that the US dollar is devaluing, and that’s why we see investors moving into gold,” he explained.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said Ghana must treat the current high prices as a windfall and save part of the proceeds.</p>



<p>“So now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold, to put in that money to guard against… that will come in,” he said.</p>



<p>He advised the Gold Board, the Bank of Ghana and government to create a dedicated fund from gold sales.</p>



<p>“My advice to probably the gold board, the central bank and the government is that whatever amount of gold sales that is coming… we create that fund just for gold,” he said.</p>



<p>He stated that the purpose is to ensure that Ghana can support the gold industry when prices fall.</p>



<p>“When the price starts to drop, we’ll be able to use it support the gold industry in Ghana,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah welcomed efforts to refine gold locally to add value, but insisted a stabilisation fund remains necessary.</p>



<p>“It’s good. We are doing a refinery to add value, but that commodity fund for gold is needed,” he said.</p>



<p>He also raised concerns about the Gold Board&#8217;s financing structure, noting that it must be carefully examined to avoid future problems.</p>



<p>“The financing model for the gold board also needs to be looked at a little bit,” he said.</p>



<p>He noted that the Gold Board has relied on government funding, but “the amount they promised was not fully released in 2025.” </p>



<p>Prof Peprah also stated that the Bank of Ghana is expected to exit financing for the gold trade.</p>



<p>He cited a legal precedent that permits the Gold Board to accept payments in advance from buyers.</p>



<p>“It allows them to take money in advance from whoever needs gold, and then be able to give them the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah warned that the financing model must be properly structured so that the Gold Board does not become “the next Coco board.”</p>



<p>He added that Ghana’s trade position could weaken if the country becomes too dependent on gold without a buffer.</p>



<p>“If we fail on gold… our trade balance will move into a very struggling position,” he cautioned.</p>

<p>An Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University in the U.S. has endorsed Ghana’s Gold Board concept but warned that poor implementation and weak financing could turn it into “the next COCOBOD.”</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, Prof. Willian Kwasi Peprah said the idea behind the Gold Board is “very good,” but stressed that the real risk lies in its operationalisation.</p>



<p>“To me, the law is good. The operationalisation is where we must watch it carefully,” he said, arguing that Ghana must not repeat past institutional mistakes.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said a key gap in the Gold Board framework is the absence of a dedicated commodity stabilisation account for gold. </p>



<p>He noted that Ghana already has stabilisation accounts for cocoa and petroleum, and gold must not be treated differently, especially given how global prices can swing.</p>



<p>“If the Gold Board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>He explained that gold prices are currently enjoying a windfall, driven by global uncertainty, inflation fears and currency hedging. According to him, gold trading is shaped by three main factors: fear, inflation, and currency.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSCZdNE0E_o?si=adO3gewCnJNKrb8T" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“We currently have fear… so many things happening in the world, which makes investors uncertain. So that is why we are seeing the gold price really, really moving up,” he said.</p>



<p>He also pointed to currency movements as a major driver. “We’ve noticed that the US dollar is devaluing, and that’s why we see investors moving into gold,” he added.</p>



<p>However, he warned that Ghana must not assume prices will remain high indefinitely. He said the country must use the current gains to prepare for the inevitable downturn.</p>



<p>“Now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said the proposed fund should be built from gold sales and used to protect the industry and the economy when prices begin to fall.</p>



<p>“My advice… is that whatever amount of gold sales that is coming… we create that fund just for gold,” he said. “When the price starts to drop, we’ll be able to use it [to] support the gold industry in Ghana.”</p>



<p>He welcomed Ghana’s plans for a refinery to add value, but insisted that a stabilisation fund is still necessary to shield the economy from price shocks.</p>



<p>He also raised concerns about the Gold Board’s financing model, noting that the institution has depended on government support but that promised funds were not fully released in 2025, while the Bank of Ghana is expected to exit financing of the gold trade.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah cited a provision of the law that permits the Gold Board to accept advance payments from buyers and supply them with gold, noting that the model must be examined carefully.</p>



<p>“That model must be really looked at… so that Gold Board does not tend to the next COCOBOD,” he warned.</p>



<p>He stressed that a revolving fund is not the same as a stabilisation fund and stated that Ghana must clearly distinguish between the two structures.</p>



<p>“Revolving fund account is not the same as stabilisation fund account,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah cautioned that, without adequate buffers, Ghana’s trade position could suffer significantly if gold prices decline.</p>



<p>“If we fail on gold… our trade balance will move into a very struggling position,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> Ivory Coast is considering cutting the price it pays farmers for cocoa beans to align with <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ghana-cuts-farmgate-cocoa-price-introduces-new-financing-model-2026-02-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghana&#8217;s</a>, two government sources told Reuters, as the world&#8217;s two largest</span> producers of the chocolate ingredient face a major <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/cocoa-stocks-main-harvest-pile-up-ivory-coast-warehouses-2026-02-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crisis</a>.</p>



<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Senior Ivory Coast officials said all options were on the table as the government debates whether to follow Ghana, which has already cut its farmgate price by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ghana-cuts-farmgate-cocoa-price-introduces-new-financing-model-2026-02-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28.6% for the rest</a> of the 2025/2026 season&#8217;s</span> main crop, in coordination with Abidjan, as it adjusts to plunging prices.</p>



<p>The farmgate price, set at the start of the harvest season, is the amount of money farmers receive for their product after harvest and before any intermediaries, exporters, processors, traders, or cooperatives add value.</p>



<p>The discussions with Ghana and within the Ivorian government on cutting the price to align with Ghana have not previously been reported.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Ivory Coast–Ghana Cocoa Initiative (ICCIG) said the two African countries, which together account for about 60% of global output, had been coordinating closely since the onset of the sector crisis.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have put all options on the table, and discussions are progressing well. Courageous and realistic decisions will be taken soon,&#8221; the first Ivory Coast official said, requesting anonymity because they are not authorised to speak on the issue.</p>



<p>The second official said the continued price fall, which has seen cocoa drop by nearly 50% in recent months, left the government with little room to manoeuvre.</p>



<p>Cocoa futures on the ICE exchange fell to their lowest level in 2-1/2 years on Tuesday, as concerns about unsold cocoa stocks in the Ivory Coast and Ghana continued to weigh on prices.</p>



<p>&#8220;We must think about the survival of the cocoa sector in the Ivory Coast. We need to act; changes are underway,&#8221; the source said, declining to disclose further details.</p>



<p>An inter-ministerial committee has met over the issue, and a decision could come soon, the two sources said.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the Ivory Coast government did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">MEASURES TO PREVENT STRUCTURAL DAMAGE</h2>



<p>Alex Assanvo, ICCIG&#8217;s executive secretary, said the two countries were adapting to the sudden market reversal and had taken measures to prevent structural damage.</p>



<p>He said the trading rooms of the Ivory Coast&#8217;s Coffee and Cocoa Council and Ghana&#8217;s COCOBOD remained in regular contact.</p>



<p>Assanvo also defended the Living Income Differential, introduced in 2019 to boost farmers&#8217; earnings, noting that recent market volatility underscores its relevance.</p>



<p>ICCIG is preparing a meeting between the two countries to strengthen coordination amid financial pressures on farmers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The organisation remains mobilised to coordinate policies in both countries,&#8221; Assanvo said, adding that all players in the sector would be convened to review market developments and propose improvements to price-stabilisation mechanisms.</p>



<p>Exporters and buyers expect the Ivory Coast to announce a cut soon, saying the question is no longer if but when.</p>



<p>&#8220;The country is resisting, but for how long? I don&#8217;t see Ivory Coast doing something different from Ghana,&#8221; said the head of an Abidjan-based export company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Microsoft said on Wednesday it did not think the U.S. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cambodian-national-dies-ice-custody-indiana-2026-02-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency</a> was using its technology for mass surveillance of civilians, but added that it provided cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools to ICE.</p>



<p>The statement from the technology company came in response to a report by The Guardian that said ICE deepened its reliance on Microsoft&#8217;s cloud technology last year as the agency ramped up arrest and deportation operations. The newspaper cited leaked documents.</p>



<p>ICE more than tripled the amount of data it stored in Microsoft&#8217;s Azure cloud platform in the six months leading up to January 2026, a period in which the agency&#8217;s budget swelled and its workforce rapidly expanded, The Guardian reported, adding ICE appeared to be using a range of Microsoft&#8217;s productivity tools, as well as AI-driven products, to search and analyze the data it holds in Azure.</p>



<p>&#8220;As we&#8217;ve previously said, Microsoft provides cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools to DHS (Department of Homeland Security, of which ICE is a part) and ICE, delivered through our key partners,&#8221; a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement.</p>



<p>&#8220;Microsoft policies and terms of service do not allow our technology to be used for the mass surveillance of civilians, and we do not believe ICE is engaged in such activity.&#8221;</p>



<p>The company said the U.S. Congress, the executive branch and the courts should draw &#8220;clear legal lines&#8221; regarding the permissible use of emerging technologies by law enforcement.</p>



<p>ICE said it will not comment on specifics involving investigative techniques, tools and technologies used in ongoing criminal probes but said it uses various forms of technology to aid arrests of criminals.</p>



<p>U.S. President&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;immigration crackdown has faced criticism from human rights advocates who say it creates an unsafe environment and lacks due process. ICE has become the symbol of Trump&#8217;s crackdown, especially after the fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens last month.</p>



<p>Trump has said his actions aim to improve domestic security and curb illegal immigration.</p>



<p>Tech companies have attempted to warm their ties with Trump during his second term in office.</p>



<p>Microsoft has also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/microsoft-disables-services-israel-defense-unit-after-review-2025-09-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously faced scrutiny</a> over the use of its technology by governments. Last September, the company said it had disabled some services used by an Israeli military unit after preliminary evidence supported a media investigation that reported mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls. </p>



<p>The ties to Israel&#8217;s military had led to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/microsoft-fires-four-workers-on-site-protests-over-companys-ties-israel-2025-08-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protests within the company</a> and some protesters were fired.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A 71-year-old ballroom dancer said she had no idea she had been cast in a Taylor Swift music video until ten minutes before filming.</p>



<p>Denise Sides, from Wrexham, was selected by the global megastar to appear in Opalite &#8211; a 90s-inspired rom-com that brought together the cast of an episode of the Graham Norton show.</p>



<p>The dance teacher said she auditioned for an &#8220;unknown artist&#8221; and once cast, the top-secret job involved being sent to the filming location in discreet transport.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then this young girl walks in, all dressed up, and she comes over and says, &#8216;Hi, I&#8217;m Taylor,&#8221; said Sides. &#8220;I was like, no way. Oh my God.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sides, who has been dancing for 60 years and teaches ballroom classes, said she had signed up for TV extra work through an agency and responded to a call-out for senior dancers on behalf of an &#8220;unknown artist&#8221;.</p>



<p>After being shortlisted, Sides received a call confirming she had been specifically chosen by the artist out of hundreds of applications.</p>



<p>But she had no idea record-breaking Swift was behind the request.</p>



<p>Sides said the whole experience was &#8220;hush-hush&#8221; and all she had been told was that the job involved recreating a dance competition.</p>



<p>It was only ten minutes before filming began that she found out the video was for a track from Swift&#8217;s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl.</p>



<p>Sides, a Swiftie herself, said she was in shock when the singer walked in.</p>



<p>&#8220;I still feel excited now [remembering it],&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Sides said Swift, who sang in and directed the video, put everyone at ease during filming and thanked dancers for their time.</p>



<p>&#8220;She knew exactly what she wanted. She&#8217;d say, &#8216;try this, try that,&#8217; and she was really nice about it,&#8221; said the dance teacher.</p>



<p>&#8220;Some can be a bit abrupt, but she wasn&#8217;t. She was lovely and so talented.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the video, Sides is seen wearing a royal-blue ballroom-dancing outfit she has owned since becoming a professional dancer in 1988.</p>



<p>She said Swift complimented her outfit and said, &#8220;I love your dress. It really fits the set.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e9c6/live/edd590e0-0366-11f1-bab5-81d0d0b0abce.jpg.webp" alt="TAS Rights Management Graham Norton, Taylor Swift and Domhnall Gleeson in the video for Taylor Swift&#039;s Opalite" style="width:840px;height:auto" title="You&#039;re never too old, says dancer, 71, cast in Taylor Swift video"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Graham Norton&#8217;s chat show played a role in the video&#8217;s casting</figcaption></figure>



<p>When Sides saw the video, which was filmed in November but released earlier this month, she said she was gobsmacked.</p>



<p>&#8220;You just can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s you,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>It was difficult to keep the experience a secret too, she added: &#8220;It was hard, I only told a few people in my dance class and my family.&#8221;</p>



<p>Opalite features Domhnall Gleeson, Lewis Capaldi, Greta Lee, and a cameo voiceover from Cillian Murphy, all of whom appeared on the Graham Norton show with Swift in October.</p>



<p>It tells the story of a lonely woman who uses a magical spray to improve her life and finds romance with a fellow loner.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2fff/live/b0ae7700-0365-11f1-b5e2-dd58fc65f0f6.jpg.webp" alt="Matt Crossick / PA Media The cast of Taylor Swift&#039;s Opalite video on Graham Norton&#039;s sofa" style="width:840px;height:auto" title="You&#039;re never too old, says dancer, 71, cast in Taylor Swift video"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The video&#8217;s cast all featured on Graham Norton&#8217;s chat show last October</figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite dancing her whole life and with decades of acting experience, Sides said the shoot with Swift was the most important of her career.</p>



<p>She said she hoped her experience would inspire others to try dancing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe people will think, &#8216;Well, if Taylor chose her, why don&#8217;t we?&#8217;,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re never too old. It was an experience I will never, ever forget.&#8221;</p>



<p>In addition to running Dens Dance Studio since the 1990s, Sides also hosts inclusive workshops for those with disabilities.</p>



<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m not teaching, I&#8217;m dancing myself,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s my happy place, my passion.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Africa&#8217;s largest economies, Nigeria and South Africa, are driving the strongest growth in demand for stablecoins and are the most optimistic about their potential, according to a survey, with many users also wanting them to become more widely accepted.</p>



<p>Stablecoins are promising faster and cheaper ways to move money in poorer countries, but as 99% of them, including the dominant Tether and USDC, are pegged to the dollar, they also raise&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/central-bank-body-bis-delivers-stark-stablecoin-warning-2025-06-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worries</a>&nbsp;about economic dollarisation and capital flight.</p>



<p>The survey, titled the Stablecoin Utility Report and conducted by YouGov with crypto firms BVNK, Coinbase, and Artemis, collected responses from more than 4,650 individuals in 15 countries who either hold or plan to hold stablecoins or cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The use of the coins today is largely for moving money between cryptocurrency markets. Nearly nine-tenths of stablecoin transactions relate to crypto trading, while just 6% are for payment of goods or services, BCG estimated in a report last year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">PREFERENCE FOR STABLECOIN PAYMENTS</h2>



<p>The report, which also found growing demand for stablecoins in other emerging countries such as India, showed over half of those surveyed had increased stablecoin holdings in the last year, with developing economies seeing the strongest trends.</p>



<p>Almost 80% of Nigerian and South African respondents already held stablecoins, the figures showed, with over 75% of those also intending to increase their holdings further in the coming year.</p>



<p>Among non-owners, the intent to start holding stablecoins was roughly twice as high in low and middle-income economies than in high-income ones, with 95% of Nigerian respondents saying they would prefer to receive payments in stablecoins than in the Naira.</p>



<p>&#8220;People are already getting paid and spending stablecoins, especially where traditional payments are slow, expensive, or unreliable,&#8221; said Chris Harmse, co-founder of BVNK.</p>



<p>But they are also &#8220;asking for greater integration into their existing financial tools,&#8221; he added.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgvoyqerxvd/Pasted%20image%201771339585825.png" alt="Stablecoin spending and desired spending" title="Biggest African economies lead stablecoin demand growth, study shows"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Stablecoin spending and desired spending</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">THREAT TO MONETARY POLICY</h2>



<p>Globally, the stablecoin market is valued at more than $310 billion, dominated by U.S.-pegged tokens such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/tether-ceo-aims-allocate-up-15-its-portfolio-gold-2026-01-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tether</a>&nbsp;($185 billion) and USDC ($75 billion). The market is expected to expand further following U.S. regulatory moves, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/companies-plan-stablecoins-under-new-law-experts-say-hurdles-remain-2025-08-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the GENIUS Act.</a></p>



<p>However, central bankers in emerging economies remain cautious. They fear <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">that stablecoins <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/stablecoins-could-suck-1-trillion-em-banks-next-three-years-standard-chartered-2025-10-07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could drain</a> domestic bank deposits, undermine monetary policy, and facilitate</span> capital flight.</p>



<p>South African Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago pointed out a potential benefit, noting remittance fees as high as $30 to send $100 to neighbouring Mozambique, a gap stablecoins could help address.</p>



<p>The survey also highlighted limited acceptance of stablecoins in retail settings and online as a barrier to broader adoption for everyday purchases and subscriptions.</p>

<p>The International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday it has approved about $91 million in funding for Niger after completing reviews of programs under its Extended Credit Facility and Resilience and Sustainability Facility.</p>



<p>The IMF said completion of the reviews would unlock about $61 million under the ECF-supported program and about $30 million under the RSF program, adding that Niger&#8217;s economic growth is expected to remain strong at 6.7% in 2026.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A Cape Coast Circuit Court has remanded into Police custody Patrick Nii Torto, a man accused of using the Office of the Vice President to swindle people with the ploy of securing them Canadian visas and work permits.</p>



<p>Torto allegedly scammed his victims out of GH¢5,325 and GH¢8,200, posing as a Vice Presidential staffer and captain in the Ghana Armed Forces.</p>



<p>Operating under the name Dr Patrick Nelson Ayittey, Torto also made his victims believe that he had affiliations with the Canadian Embassy in Ghana, the police told the court on Tuesday.</p>



<p>He pleaded not guilty to the charge of defrauding by false pretences, but the court, presided over by Madam Nana Aba Quiaba Nunoo, remanded him into police custody to assist in further investigations.</p>



<p>Torto was arrested from his hideout at Abura by the police in Cape Coast following a complaint filed against him at the Abura police Station on Monday, February 16.</p>



<p>According to the Police, the accused person scammed his victims between December 2025 and January 2026 and failed to refund their monies despite repeated demands.</p>



<p>The Police conducted a search at his residence and found about 10 Ghanaian passports and other documents, including school certificates, birth certificates, and Ghana Cards.</p>



<p>Further enquiries also revealed that the suspect was neither an officer of the Ghana Armed Forces or a worker at the Vice President’s Office and had no affiliations with the Canadian Embassy.</p>



<p>The Police also gathered that Torto was not a medical doctor or doctorate degree holder.</p>



<p>He is expected to reappear before the court on Tuesday, March 03, 2026.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A mobile money vendor has appeared before the Dansoman Circuit Court, accused of stealing GH¢112,660 from her employer. </p>



<p>Juliana Addy, 29, pleaded not guilty to the charge of stealing. </p>



<p> The court granted her bail in the sum of GH¢20,000 with two sureties and directed her to deposit copies of her Ghana Card with the Court Registry and report to the Police every two weeks. </p>



<p>&nbsp;It also directed the prosecution to file disclosures and witness statements for the Case Management Conference and adjourned the matter to March 25, 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p> The prosecution said the complainant, Esther Fosuah Cobbinah, is an entrepreneur who owns a company with a branch at the Last Stop in Dansoman, Accra. </p>



<p>&nbsp;It said Addy, employed in January 2024, was assigned to operate&nbsp;Cobbinah’s&nbsp;mobile money shop and supervise other employees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The prosecution explained that Addy continued in that role until June 25, 2025, when&nbsp;Cobbinah&nbsp;travelled to the USA for six months, and left her in charge of one of the shops and its stock.&nbsp;</p>



<p> It said upon Cobbinah’s return in December 2025, a routine audit revealed discrepancies, and a joint annual audit on January 2, 2026, showed that Addy could not account for GH¢104,300. </p>



<p> Addy reportedly told the police she used the money to pay her father’s medical bills and her brother’s tuition fees, and to spend the remainder. </p>



<p> The prosecution said that Addy was arrested on January 6, 2026, after Cobbinah lodged a formal complaint at the Dansoman Police Station, and that Cobbinah admitted to the offence during police interrogation. </p>



<p>It said investigations also revealed that Addy had used the company’s mobile money merchant numbers to secure online loans of GH¢5,225 and GH¢3,135 from a loan firm without Cobbinah’s knowledge. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Accra Circuit Court has remanded eleven persons into police custody for alleged involvement in land guard activities at&nbsp;Akokofoto, Dansoman, Accra.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The accused are Kamal Yussif alias Biker,&nbsp;Asafoatse&nbsp;Abass Seidu, Jacob Lartey alias Lartey Kwei,&nbsp;Adoku&nbsp;Samuel alias&nbsp;Asafoatse, Mohammed Issah alias Galadima, Emmanuel Nii Acquah alias&nbsp;Asafoatse, Iddrisu Akaya Chum, John&nbsp;Afade, Teiko Ofori and Emmanuel&nbsp;Gyemfi&nbsp;Nkrumah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They have been charged with conspiracy to commit a crime, engaging in land guard activities and resisting arrest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The prosecution told the court that the accused resisted arrest, during which Kamal Yussif allegedly punched Chief Inspector Isaac&nbsp;Mbilla&nbsp;on the mouth, injuring his teeth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The accused pleaded not guilty and are expected to reappear before the court on February 28, 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Defence counsel prayed for bail, but the prosecution, led by Chief Inspector Jonas Lawer, opposed the application, citing ongoing investigations. </p>



<p>Prosecution said the complainants, Madam Sarah&nbsp;Forkuo, Managing Director of&nbsp;Osamanpa&nbsp;Estate Developers, and&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;John Agyepong, both of East Legon, had secured a Supreme Court judgement placing the disputed land in their possession.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It said on February 16, 2026, the accused allegedly invaded the land with sticks,&nbsp;cutlasses&nbsp;and guns, preventing the complainants and their workers from developing the property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A distress call was made to the Police Headquarters, and officers dispatched to the scene arrested the accused, who resisted but were eventually overpowered and taken to the Regional Police Headquarters for further investigations.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The US presidential jet is getting a new paint design that will include one of President Donald Trump&#8217;s preferred colour choices for the White House and his hotels, gold.</p>



<p>Air Force One and other aircraft used by high-level US officials, including First Lady Melania Trump, are being repainted in gold, deep red, and navy blue while undergoing scheduled repairs and maintenance, according to the US Air Force.</p>



<p>The colours will also feature on a new Boeing 747-8i luxury aircraft donated to the presidential fleet by Qatar, an Air Force spokesperson told CBS.</p>



<p>The white, blue, and robin&#8217;s-egg blue associated with the presidential jet have been in use since the 1960s, when John F. Kennedy was president.</p>



<p>Trump has called for updates to the executive fleet since his first term. His successor, former President Joe Biden, cancelled a broad makeover Trump had initially planned.</p>



<p>The new colours have already been spotted on model aircraft seen at the White House, where Trump is also making his aesthetic imprint, from the large-scale plans for a new ballroom to the more subtle installation of gold signs in a curling font.</p>



<p>The private plane Trump travelled on during his 2024 campaign, sometimes called &#8220;Trump Force One&#8221;, used the same colour palette as the presidential fleet.</p>



<p>While it is not clear how much the paint jobs will cost, the US Air Force, which operates the executive planes, said in a statement to the BBC that the new colour requirements were &#8220;not expected to result in additional delays or costs to the program.&#8221;</p>



<p>It added that it was implementing the new colour scheme on the Boeing VC-25B (a variant of the Boeing 747) currently used to transport the president, as well as on four C-32 jets often used as &#8220;Air Force Two&#8221; for the vice president, and on the jet donated by Qatar. Painting has been completed on one of the C-32 aircraft.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cc68/live/44f4bae0-0cd6-11f1-b054-335fa224f76a.jpg.webp" alt="AFP via Getty Images Air Force One lands in Tokyo, Japan  in October 2025" style="width:840px;height:auto" title="Air Force One set for makeover paint job with new colours"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Air Force One in its current colours</figcaption></figure>



<p>Preparations began last summer for the Pentagon to refit the Qatari jumbo jet that is expected to serve as Air Force One. The Boeing aircraft &#8211; valued at $400m (£300m) &#8211; was donated by Qatar as an &#8220;unconditional&#8221; gift, with any necessary retrofitting costs being borne by the US government.</p>



<p>While any plane where the president is a passenger is called &#8220;Air Force One&#8221;, the holder of the highest office in the country most often flies on a specialised jet that includes an office, a bedroom suite, two kitchen galleys that can prepare 100 meals, office space and a medical facility, according to Boeing.</p>

<p>Bodo/Glimt&#8217;s fairytale continues as they added Inter Milan to their list of prized scalps to put them within touching distance of a place in the Champions League last 16.</p>



<p>Bodo are still in their off-season in Norway, yet they overpowered Inter in the second half after beating Manchester City and Atletico Madrid last month.</p>



<p>Jens Petter Hauge and Kapser Waarts Hogh struck inside three second-half minutes after Francesco Pio Esposito had cancelled out Sondre Fet&#8217;s opener.</p>



<p>Inter may be eight points clear at the top of Serie A and have been Champions League finalists in two of the last three seasons, but they were made to look ordinary by Bodo in the Arctic Circle.</p>



<p>Bodo took the lead after 20 minutes on their artificial surface when Hogh backheeled the ball for Fet to finish expertly.</p>



<p>Inter responded and former Manchester United defender Matteo Darmian hit the post before Nicolo Barella shot straight at Bodo goalkeeper Nikita Haikin.</p>



<p>Inter&#8217;s pressure paid off and when Carlos Augusto&#8217;s header from Barella&#8217;s cross was blocked, the ball fell to Esposito who turned and fired home.</p>



<p>The visitors and three-time winners were denied by the woodwork again when Lautaro Martinez hit the post before Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer touched Hogh&#8217;s drive over.</p>



<p>Inter did not heed this warning, and Bodo retook the lead on 61 minutes when they countered, and Hogh teed up Hauge on the left to power home a left-footed drive into the top corner.</p>



<p>Inter were stunned, and Bodo took full advantage to score a third when Ole Didrik Blomberg squared the ball for Hogh to tap home.</p>

<p>The Ga Mantse, King Tackie Teiko Tsuru II, is in stable condition following a road accident in the early hours of Wednesday morning.</p>



<p>The incident occurred at about 2:00am at Pai-Katanga in the Oti Region while the King was returning to Accra from Tamale.</p>



<p>Sources close to the palace indicate that he had travelled to the Northern Region on a private visit at the invitation of the Yaa Naa.</p>



<p>The visit, described as cordial and significant, formed part of ongoing engagements between traditional authorities aimed at strengthening bonds of unity and mutual respect among Ghana’s revered institutions.</p>

<p>On his return journey to Accra, however, the Ga Mantse’s vehicle was involved in an accident. Fortunately, he escaped unhurt and is reported to be in stable condition.</p>



<p>Personnel of the Ghana Police Service were said to have responded swiftly and timely when they were called to the scene.</p>



<p>While the circumstances surrounding the accident are yet to be fully detailed, the overall mood at the palace is one of relief and thanksgiving, as the Ga Mantse continues to recover and remains in good spirits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Leaders Arsenal blew a 2-0 lead in dramatic fashion to draw at rock-bottom Wolves and missed the chance to go seven points clear at the top of the Premier League.</p>



<p>Gunners defender Riccardo Calafiori turned in debutant Tom Edozie&#8217;s shot in the fourth minute of added time for a late leveller after goalkeeper David Raya and centre-back Gabriel made a mess of clearing a high ball into the box.</p>



<p>Hugo Bueno had started Wolves&#8217; comeback with a stunning curling effort after Bukayo Saka, with his first goal in 15 games, and Piero Hincapie gave Arsenal what seemed a commanding lead.</p>



<p>The Gunners had control at Molineux as Bukayo Saka<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gje501g51o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;celebrated his new contract with the fifth-minute opener.</a></p>



<p>The England forward nodded in Declan Rice&#8217;s cross &#8211; just a day after signing a fresh five-year deal at the Emirates &#8211; before Hincapie added a 56th-minute second with a smart finish from a Gabriel pass for his first goal for the club.</p>



<p>Yet after Saka &#8211; who ended a 15-game goal drought in all competitions &#8211; went off following treatment, Arsenal struggled under pressure as Hugo Bueno pulled a goal back with a stunning curler in the 61st minute.</p>



<p>Wolves pushed at the end, and when Gabriel got in the way as Raya tried to clear a cross, 19-year-old Edozie, on for his senior debut as a substitute, slammed in a shot that struck Calafiori and went in off the post.</p>



<p>Arsenal were stunned, with tempers frayed at the end after Gabriel Jesus shoved over Yerson Mosquera, as their lead over Manchester City is five points, with Pep Guardiola&#8217;s side having a game in hand.</p>



<p>It was a damaging night for Mikel Arteta&#8217;s men in their quest for a first league title since 2004.</p>



<p>Yet they still remain in the hunt for a quadruple of trophies, also facing City in next month&#8217;s Carabao Cup final, entering the Champions League last 16 (having topped the league phase), and in the FA Cup fifth round.</p>



<p>But this result will once more spark doubts over Arsenal&#8217;s staying power, having finished second in the past three successive seasons.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Wolves-analysis-Strugglers-going-down-fighting-">Wolves analysis: Strugglers going down fighting</h2>



<p>Despite being adrift at the bottom and 17 points from safety, Wolves are still fighting and will still have a say in how this Premier League season finishes.</p>



<p>With an hour gone it was a very different scenario as Arsenal led 2-0 and looked on course to see out a comfortable victory.</p>



<p>But that is when Wolves relaxed and began to play, Hugo Bueno scoring the goal of the game with a cracking effort.</p>



<p>Edozie&#8217;s dream leveller &#8211; a first appearance in senior football marked by a first goal even if Calafiori played his part &#8211; epitomised Wolves&#8217; spirit.</p>



<p>That is all they had left &#8211; and had to find &#8211; under Rob Edwards, with the salvage operation already bleak when he replaced Vitor Pereira in November.</p>



<p>They sensed an Arsenal collapse and scrapped their way to a point &#8211; something that was denied them at Emirates Stadium back in December when Mosquera&#8217;s 90th-minute own goal gave the Gunners a 2-1 success.</p>



<p>This point will matter to boss Edwards, the players and the Molineux faithful.</p>



<p>It has been a fractured place for a long time during the first half of an unhappy season.</p>



<p>Unity has returned recently and refusing to give up against the leaders with a gutsy display will hearten Wolves as they prepare for life in the Championship and build for a Premier League return at the first attempt.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Arsenal-analysis-Pressure-mounts-on-Gunners-yet-again">Arsenal analysis: Pressure mounts on Gunners yet again</h2>



<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/topics/cp99zjx9mv1t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Howell</a></strong>, Football reporter</p>



<p>Arsenal&#8217;s lacklustre performance at Wolves has only heightened the nerves of supporters hoping to see them end their title drought.</p>



<p>Despite leading through Saka&#8217;s close-range header &#8211; his first goal since December &#8211; they lacked flow in attack.</p>



<p>Boss Arteta had again picked Saka in the number 10 role rather than the wing after an impressive performance in the FA Cup win over Wigan &#8211; and it looked as though that decision had the desired effect to get his side&#8217;s frontline firing.</p>



<p>However, despite getting a second goal from Hincapie, Arsenal did not do enough, nor did they look comfortable enough to deny the battling hosts.</p>



<p>This was meant to be a routine win against the league&#8217;s bottom club &#8211; one they had beaten nine successive times since 2021 and scored against for a 37th time on the trot in all competitions.</p>



<p>Raya didn&#8217;t have a save to make in the first half, but Arsenal did not dominate as they should and paid the price.</p>



<p>With games against London rivals Tottenham and Chelsea to follow, the Gunners find themselves under a cloud of uncertainty and whether their title dream will turn into another nightmare.</p>



<p>A trip to second-placed Manchester City will be one of their remaining 11 games and Arteta and his squad will have to finally show they can deal with the pressure in the title run-in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Whats-next-for-these-teams">What&#8217;s next for these teams?</h2>



<p>Rob Edwards takes his Wolves side to Crystal Palace on Sunday, 22 February (14:00 GMT), before hosting Aston Villa on Friday, 27 February (20:00 GMT).</p>



<p>The north London derby at Tottenham awaits Arsenal on Sunday, 22 February (16:30 GMT) and then Chelsea visit the Emirates on Sunday, 1 March (16:30 GMT).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Club Brugge scored a dramatic late equaliser as they twice fought back against Atletico Madrid to leave their Champions League knockout phase play-off tie delicately poised.</p>



<p>The hosts, who trailed 2-0 at the interval to a Julian Alvarez penalty and Ademola Lookman&#8217;s goal, rallied after the break with Raphael Onyedika and Nicolo Tresoldi drawing them level.</p>



<p>Joel Ordonez&#8217;s own goal threatened to undo their efforts until Christos Tzolis drove in an 89th-minute equaliser to round off a see-saw contest.</p>



<p>The visitors had made the perfect start, with Alvarez converting from the spot after home full-back Joaquin Seys mistimed a defensive clearance and was penalised for handling in his own box.</p>



<p>When Lookman bundled in on his European debut for Atletico moments before the interval, against a Club Brugge side he faced while an Atalanta player in September, Diego Simeone&#8217;s side looked on course for a comfortable victory.</p>



<p>However, Nigeria international Onyedika prodded in just after the restart to bring the hosts back into the contest.</p>



<p>And when the impressive Tresoldi levelled on the hour mark, getting across his marker to steer the ball past away goalkeeper Jan Oblak, they looked favourites to complete a remarkable turnaround.</p>



<p>It was certainly no more than Club Brugge deserved with Onyedika twice going close in the first period, when Atletico were guilty of sitting back after going a goal ahead.</p>



<p>Simeone, who had watched his side thrash Barcelona then disappoint in a 3-0 defeat by Rayo Vallecano, looked far from amused in his technical area but the introduction of Alexander Sorloth helped shift the momentum back towards his team.</p>



<p>The Norway international hit the woodwork within four minutes of replacing Antoine Griezmann and went close with another effort before pressuring Ordonez to turn into this own net.</p>



<p>Club Brugge were not to be denied though, with Greek international Tzolis rescuing a draw with an unerring finish.</p>



<p>The return leg takes place in Madrid on Tuesday, 24 February (20:00 GMT), with the winners facing Liverpool or Tottenham in the last 16.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Benfica claim there is a &#8220;defamation campaign&#8221; against Gianluca Prestianni after Uefa launched an investigation into claims he racially abused Real Madrid winger Vinicius Jr.</p>



<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Tuesday&#8217;s Champions League tie at Benfica was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cpv843x1zgzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">halted for 10 minutes</a> after Vinicius reported alleged racist abuse to referee Francois Letexier, and he and his teammates left the field.</span></p>



<p>Brazil international Vinicius, who has been a victim of numerous incidents of racist abuse during his playing career, later said in a post on Instagram: &#8220;Racists are, above all, cowards.&#8221;</p>



<p>Prestianni, who could face a minimum 10-match ban from European competition if found guilty, denied directing racial abuse at Vinicius.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Benfica defended Prestianni in a post on their official X account, along with a video of the alleged incident, saying: &#8220;Given the distance, the Real Madrid players could not have heard what they claim to have heard.&#8221;</p>



<p>The club added they &#8220;fully support&#8221; and believe the version of events presented by Prestianni.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Prestianni&#8217;s] conduct in the service of the club has always been guided by respect for opponents, institutions and the principles that define Benfica&#8217;s identity,&#8221; Benfica added.</p>



<p>&#8220;The club regrets the defamation campaign of which the player has been a victim.&#8221;</p>



<p>Benfica manager Jose Mourinho has been criticised for comments he made after the match, including saying Vinicius had been disrespectful in his goal celebration.</p>



<p>Former referee Mark Clattenburg, who was a pundit for the match on Amazon Prime, apologised on Wednesday for his &#8220;clumsy&#8221; comments on the incident.</p>



<p>Clattenburg said Vinicius had &#8220;not helped himself&#8221; and made things difficult for the referee.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing justifies racism in sport or in life. I&#8217;m grateful to have a chance to follow up on last night. I got it wrong, I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; the 50-year-old <a href="https://x.com/clattenburg1975/status/2024173363187368123">posted on X., external</a></p>



<p>&#8220;It was live TV, my job is to respond to the moment, and the words I used were clumsy and not right.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m already learning from this and appreciate my colleagues who covered the situation with class throughout.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Discrimination-is-one-thing-gaslighting-is-another-the-reaction">&#8216;Discrimination is one thing, gaslighting is another&#8217; &#8211; the reaction</h2>



<p>Mourinho said in his post-match interview that he had been told different things by Vinicius and Prestianni regarding the incident.</p>



<p>The Portuguese, who managed Real for 178 games between 2010 and 2013, pointed to their legendary striker Eusebio as proof that Benfica is not a racist club.</p>



<p>&#8220;The club reaffirms, clearly and unequivocally, its historical and unwavering commitment to defending the values of equality, respect and inclusion, which are in line with the core values of its foundation and have Eusebio as their greatest symbol,&#8221; Benfica said.</p>



<p>Mourinho&#8217;s and Benfica&#8217;s comments have been criticised by several people, including anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.</p>



<p>Kick It Out chair Sanjay Bhandari said both the club and manager had &#8220;failed&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a natural inclination to want to believe your player, but the reality is they didn&#8217;t hear it,&#8221; Bhandari told BBC Sport.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only two people who are in that conversation and two people who could have heard what was said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think the better reaction from a club with Benfica&#8217;s fantastic stature would be to say we&#8217;re going to cooperate with the investigation.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is quite typical after these kinds of discriminatory events. The discrimination is one thing, the gaslighting is another.&#8221;</p>



<p>FIFA president Gianni Infantino said he was &#8220;shocked and saddened&#8221; by the incident and commended Letexier for activating the anti-racism protocol.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is absolutely no room for racism in our sport and in society &#8211; we need all the relevant stakeholders to take action and hold those responsible to account,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will always continue to reiterate: No to racism, no to any form of discrimination!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz remain on course to meet in the Qatar Open final after both claimed straight-set wins on Wednesday.</p>



<p>World number two Sinner beat Australia&#8217;s Alexei Popyrin 6-3 7-5 to reach the quarter-finals in Doha, before Alcaraz won 6-2 7-5 against France&#8217;s Valentin Royer.</p>



<p>The pair met in six finals last year, three of them at Grand Slams, with world number one Alcaraz winning the French and US Opens.</p>



<p>The 22-year-old Spaniard will next face Karen Khachanov, who beat Marton Fucsovics 6-2 4-6 6-4.</p>



<p>Sixth seed Jakub Mensik breezed past Zhang Zhizhen 6-3 6-2 to set up a last-eight meeting with Sinner, who has now reached at least the quarter-finals in 28 of his past 30 tournaments, stretching back to the 2023 ATP Finals in Turin.</p>



<p>The 24-year-old Italian, who lifted last year&#8217;s Australian Open and Wimbledon titles, has now won 22 of his past 23 matches. His only defeat came against Novak Djokovic in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/clyn9l0zvnpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Open semi-finals last month.</a></p>



<p>Meanwhile, Greece&#8217;s Stefanos Tsitsipas upset world number 11 Daniil Medvedev 6-3 6-4 in Doha to book a clash with fifth seed Andrey Rublev, who beat Fabian Marozsan 6-2 6-4.</p>



<p>The unseeded Frenchman Arthur Fils and Czech Jiri Lehecka, seeded eighth, complete the quarter-final line-up having also claimed comfortable victories.</p>

<p>Friday’s launch, according to officials of Kenpong Travel and Tours, will formally introduce a range of curated travel packages designed to give Ghanaian football fans seamless access to the 2026 FIFA World Cup.</p>



<p>The packages are expected to cover visa assistance, flight arrangements, accommodation, match ticket guidance and on-ground logistics, positioning Kenpong Travel and Tours as a one-stop solution for supporters eager to experience the tournament live.</p>



<p>With anticipation already building globally for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Kenpong Travel and Tours says the launch signals its intent to offer structured, secure and competitively priced travel options to allow Ghanaian football fans to savour football’s highest competition.</p>



<p>Industry watchers say the initiative reflects growing confidence among Ghanaian travel operators in delivering premium international sports tourism experiences, especially for major global tournaments.</p>



<p>Organisers indicate that the launch will also provide an opportunity for sports enthusiasts, corporate bodies and the media to interact with officials and gain firsthand insight into the packages on offer.</p>



<p>The 2026 FIFA World Cup to be hosted across three nations – USA, Canada and Mexico &#8211; is expected to draw millions of fans from across the globe, and Kenpong Travel and Tours says it is determined to ensure that Ghanaian supporters are not left behind.</p>



<p>The Black Stars of Ghana, with a rich and exciting history of participating in four World Cup finals already &#8211; 2006, 2010, 2014, 2022, &#8211; will be hoping to further impress the world and reinforce its pedigree as a competitive football nation with the 2026 appearance, the fifth in the series.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Phillipe Coutinho says he is leaving boyhood club Vasco da Gama because he is &#8220;tired mentally&#8221; and his &#8220;cycle at the club has ended&#8221;.</p>



<p>The former Liverpool and Barcelona midfielder was substituted at half-time after being booed by fans during Vasco&#8217;s win on penalties over Volta Redonda last week.</p>



<p>Coutinho, who has 68 caps for Brazil, did not return to the bench in the second half to watch the remainder of the game.</p>



<p>In a lengthy, emotional statement on Instagram, the 33-year-old says he is leaving Vasco because &#8220;now is the time to take step back&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would never disrespect the fans, my team-mates and Vasco. I&#8217;ve never done that anywhere I&#8217;ve been. Those who know me know that,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;At that moment, on the way to the locker room, I felt and realised that my cycle at the club had ended, and I didn&#8217;t come back to prioritise my mental health.</p>



<p>&#8220;It hurts a lot. The truth is that I&#8217;m very tired mentally. With a tight heart, I understand that now is the time to take a step back and end this cycle in Vasco.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful for everything I&#8217;ve lived here. I&#8217;ll take Vasco with me forever. In the chest. In history. In life.&#8221;</p>



<p>Vasco have not confirmed Coutinho&#8217;s departure, but BBC Sport have reached out for comment.</p>



<p>Coutinho has played 81 times and scored 17 goals for Vasco since rejoining for a second stint in 2024.</p>



<p>He started his career at Vasco, then joined Inter Milan and later moved to Liverpool in 2013.</p>



<p>He scored 54 goals in 201 games for the Reds before joining Barcelona for £142m in 2018.</p>



<p>He later had stints at Bayern Munich, Aston Villa and Al-Duhail before returning to Vasco.</p>



<p>&#8220;I chose to go back to Vasco because I love this club. I love everything that Vasco represents in my life,&#8221; added Coutinho.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wearing this shirt was one of the most important choices I&#8217;ve ever made. And, in every training session, in every game, I gave my best. Always!&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghanaian track and field athlete Doris Quainoo delivered a standout performance at the Jarvis City Invite (also known as the Jarvis Scott Invitational) in Lubbock, Texas, over the weekend of February 13-14, 2026, showcasing her steady improvement and competitive spirit in the women’s 60m hurdles.</p>



<p>Representing the University of South Florida (USF) Bulls, the junior from Gomoa Dawurampong, Ghana, progressed impressively through each round of the event. <br></p>



<p>In the preliminaries, Quainoo placed ninth with a time of 8.55 seconds. She bounced back strongly in the semifinals, securing third place and clocking 8.31 seconds, a clear step forward. </p>



<p>The final proved to be her breakthrough moment; Quainoo surged to second place overall, crossing the line in a new personal best of 8.23 seconds.</p>



<p>The consistent drops in her times highlighted her ability to build momentum under pressure and refine her technique mid-competition.</p>



<p>Quainoo’s achievement added a bright spot to an already strong showing for the USF track and field program, which set three new program records and claimed multiple podium finishes across the two-day meet.</p>



<p>On the men’s side, Markel Jones dominated the 60m hurdles, winning the final in 7.67 seconds after strong prelim (7.77) and semi (7.71) runs. Nathan Metelus broke the program record in the 200m with 20.66 seconds (finishing second overall), while Karim Belmahdi set a new mark in the 800m at 1:49.6. <br></p>



<p>The men’s 4x400m relay team, featuring Devontie Archer, Metelus, Alexavier Monfries, and Jones, stormed to first place and another program record with 3:03.82.</p>



<p>Other notable results included Mercy Angaamchaab’s second-place finish in the women’s 800m (2:10.24), and solid contributions across sprints, field events, and relays that underscored the Bulls’ depth and rising form this indoor season.</p>



<p>The performance comes amid USF’s recent success, including back-to-back American Athletic Conference Indoor Championships in 2024 and 2025, plus the 2024 AAC Outdoor title. The program has produced numerous All-Americans and continues to build under head coach Erik Jenkins.</p>



<p>For Quainoo, a hurdles specialist who has represented Ghana internationally and previously competed at the collegiate level before transferring to USF, this PB in the 60m hurdles marks another step in her development as she balances academic pursuits with elite athletics.</p>



<p>The Bulls now turn their attention to the Tampa Classic on February 21 to kick off the outdoor season, followed by the American Indoor Championships from February 26-28 in Birmingham, Alabama. With momentum like this, USF and Quainoo, look poised for more breakthroughs ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Spanish police have arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of hacking a hotel booking website and reserving luxury rooms priced at up to €1,000 ($1,180; £870) per night for just one euro cent.</p>



<p>He was detained at a Madrid hotel, where he was accused of incurring charges totalling more than €20,000 across several stays.</p>



<p>Police said the alleged crime involved altering the payment validation system and was the first of its kind to be detected.</p>



<p>Their investigation began after a travel booking site reported suspicious activity. It took just four days to complete &#8211; the Spanish outlet ABC reported that the suspect used his real identity to make the reservations.</p>



<p>According to police, the suspect is believed to have sabotaged the payment system via a cyberattack, causing the system to authorise his transaction after entering only 1 cent as the charged amount.</p>



<p>Police said the transaction initially appeared to have been carried out correctly. The irregularity was only discovered when the payment platform transferred the actual amount &#8211; €0.01 &#8211; to the hotel company.</p>



<p>Four days later, police located the suspect at the Madrid hotel and arrested him. His most recent stay there was for four nights and typically cost €4,000.</p>



<p>They said the man had also consumed mini-bar items during his stays and left other bills unpaid.</p>



<p>The police statement suggests that bookings had been made at other hotels, though no details were provided.</p>



<p>ABC reported that the suspect had previously been arrested in the Canary Islands, where he had also stayed at a luxury hotel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Instagram-owner Meta Platforms, appeared in a California court on Wednesday defending his leadership of the company in a landmark legal case over whether social media is addictive for children.</p>



<p>It is Zuckerberg&#8217;s first appearance before a jury after years of backlash against Meta, which also owns WhatsApp and Facebook, which he co-founded.</p>



<p>Meta&#8217;s lawyers have argued that the lead plaintiff in this case, known by her initials K.G.M., was harmed by other factors in her life, not by her use of Instagram.</p>



<p>The trial, in which Google&#8217;s YouTube is also a defendant, is being closely watched for its implications for thousands of similar lawsuits facing social media firms.</p>



<p>TikTok and Snapchat, which had also been named in the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24g8v6qr1mo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settled</a> shortly before the trial was scheduled to begin. Terms of the settlements were not disclosed.</p>



<p>Lawyers for K.G.M. or Kaley, who started using Instagram and YouTube as a child, have accused social media firms of working to addict young users, despite being aware of risks to mental health.</p>



<p>She attended the proceedings on Wednesday, sitting directly across from Zuckerberg, who arrived at court with an entourage of security and associates.</p>



<p>Bereaved parents were also among those in the courtroom to watch the proceedings.</p>



<p>Mark Lanier, representing K.G.M., pressed Zuckerberg about his efforts to get users to spend more time on his platforms, confronting the executive with emails he had written.</p>



<p>In 2015, for example, Zuckerberg told a group of executives that his goals for the year included seeing &#8220;time spent increase by 12%&#8221; and the &#8220;teen trend be reversed.&#8221;</p>



<p>A year earlier, he had identified time spent as &#8220;the most concerning&#8221; metric being tracked by the company.</p>



<p>Gesturing to his client, Lanier noted that the emails were written when she was only nine or 10 years old, and already using Instagram.</p>



<p>Zuckerberg admitted that &#8220;at an earlier point in the company&#8221; he would give executives goals to increase time spent, while also insisting that was no longer how the company operated.</p>



<p>He also said that if something is of value, &#8220;people tend to use it more.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lanier noted that people who are addicted to something also tend to increase their use.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to say to that,&#8221; Zuckerberg replied. &#8220;I think that may be true, but I don&#8217;t know if that applies here.&#8221;</p>



<p>In questioning last week, Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, challenged the idea of social media addiction, arguing that even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn71mgmzljlo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16-hours of Instagram use</a>&nbsp;in a single day did not show an addiction.</p>



<p>The trial is expected to last several weeks. It is also set to include testimony from former Meta employees who have since spoken out about the company&#8217;s practices.</p>



<p>YouTube boss Neal Mohan was also expected to appear but is no longer being called to testify, the BBC has learned.</p>



<p>The case is one of thousands of similar lawsuits brought by families, state prosecutors, and school districts that are currently winding their way through U.S. courts.</p>



<p>The lawsuits accuse Meta and other social media platforms, including TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube, of functioning in an addictive manner that ultimately has harmed many children.</p>



<p>In one such case, 29 state attorneys general are urging a California federal court to order the platforms to make several changes immediately, before any trial, including requiring Meta to remove all accounts known to belong to users under 13 years of age.</p>



<p>A growing number of countries are restricting social media use among young people. Australia implemented a ban on social media accounts for people under 16 late last year.</p>



<p>The UK, Denmark, France and Spain are considering similar measures.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At least 33 miners have died in a suspected carbon-monoxide leak at a lead and zinc mine in central Nigeria's Plateau state, witnesses have told the BBC.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At least 33 miners have died in a suspected carbon-monoxide leak at a lead and zinc mine in central Nigeria&#8217;s Plateau state, witnesses have told the BBC.</p>



<p>The tragedy is believed to have occurred just before sunrise at a site outside the town of Wase, operated by the mining company Solid Unity Nigeria Ltd.</p>



<p>Toxic gas is believed to have built up underground in poorly ventilated tunnels, causing the workers to collapse just before the end of their night shift.</p>



<p>They were discovered by those reporting for work in the morning; more than 20 other miners were rescued and rushed to the hospital for treatment.</p>



<p>Security personnel have sealed off the mine, about 200km (124 miles) south-east of the state capital, Jos, as investigations begin to determine the cause of the leak.</p>



<p>State officials are yet to visit the area, and response efforts have reportedly been slow because of security concerns &#8211; armed criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, have been active there in recent years.</p>



<p>Safiyanu Haruna, one of the miners who found the bodies at the start of his shift, told the BBC that some of the miners who were underground survived and were taken to a hospital in Wase for treatment.</p>



<p>According to Haruna, the incident occurred at around 06:30 local time (05:30 GMT), killing 37 miners.</p>



<p>He said the miners had just finished their early-morning Muslim prayers and had returned underground to finish their shift.</p>



<p>The Plateau state government has issued a statement saying that, according to its preliminary investigation, 33 miners were killed in a blast at the mine &#8211; but workers at the scene say this is not the case.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was carbon-monoxide gas that leaked and killed them,&#8221; Haruna said.</p>



<p>&#8220;There was no rescue for them at the time because those who were coming for the morning shift had yet to arrive,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is sad to lose 37 miners who were struggling to make ends meet. We&#8217;re disturbed by the incident.&#8221;</p>



<p>The victims, believed to be men aged between 20 and 40, were buried shortly afterwards in accordance with local tradition, another local resident told the BBC.</p>



<p>The news has devastated the mainly Muslim community.</p>



<p>Mining disasters occur relatively frequently in Nigeria.</p>



<p>Less than two years ago, dozens of gold miners died after being trapped underground when a pit collapsed in neighbouring Niger state.</p>



<p>Officials believe the incident was caused by torrential rains that softened the soil.</p>



<p>The tragedy is likely to renew concerns over safety standards in Nigeria&#8217;s mining sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the First Lady has expressed relief following the safe recovery of the baby stolen from the Mamprobi Polyclinic and her successful reunion with her biological mother and family.</p>



<p>In a statement, the First Lady commended the Ghana Police Service for a swift and professional response that led to the arrest of the suspect and the safe return of the baby.</p>



<p>The statement also struck a strong cautionary note, acknowledging the emotional struggles of women and families dealing with conception challenges, but warning that such difficulties must never be allowed to justify criminal actions.</p>



<p>“While we empathise deeply with women and families facing challenges with conception, desperation must never be allowed to lead to such unconscionable acts,” the statement said.</p>



<p>The Office further urged medical facilities and maternity homes nationwide to strengthen security measures to better protect mothers and newborns.</p>



<p>It emphasised that the safety of mothers and babies must be prioritised, especially in healthcare settings where families expect the highest level of protection.</p>



<p>“The safety of every mother and child must be paramount,” the statement added.</p>



<p>The First Lady’s Office also encouraged individuals who genuinely wish to build families through adoption to follow the legal process by engaging accredited adoption agencies and adhering to the required procedures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During high-level engagements with Nigerian traditional leaders, civil society organisations, and development partners, the president of the Ford Foundation, Heather Gerken, applauded the foundation’s long-standing commitment to advancing democracy, human rights, and social justice in West Africa.</p>



<p>The engagements were part of Gerken’s official first visit to Nigeria, during which she participated in a conference that convened more than 180 traditional and community leaders from across Africa working to advance solutions to gender-based violence and community engagement. </p>



<p>Gerken also met with several grantees working on climate justice issues, including Spaces for Change, Health of Mother Earth Foundation, Socio- Economic Rights and Accountability Project, Africa Climate Foundation, Africa Centre for Energy Policy, BudGIT Foundation, Centre for Research and Action on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights and Sustainable Energy for All, who discussed the need for equitable energy access, accountable governance and strengthening civil society to deliver sustainable development outcomes.</p>



<p>The visit also featured a dinner hosted by Ford Foundation Board member, Gbenga Oyebode, and attended by distinguished Nigerians, including His Royal Majesty Igwe Alfred Nnaemeka Achebe, Dr Muhammadu Sanusi II, former Governor of Ekiti State Dr Kayode Fayemi, former First Lady of Ekiti State Erelu Bisi Fayemi, and Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, Chairman of Access Holdings, alongside leaders from civil society and  Heads of Foundations.</p>



<p>Speaking at the dinner, Gerken thanked hosts and guests for the warm reception, describing the gathering as a reflection of Nigeria’s leadership and civic strength.</p>



<p>“When I saw the list of people here tonight, I was struck by the depth of wisdom and experience in this room,” she said. </p>



<p>“These are voices shaping how Nigeria and the world think about justice, democracy, and development.”</p>



<p>Gerken noted that her visit was especially meaningful, as the Foundation has maintained an unbroken partnership with Nigeria for 65 years. </p>



<p>“Coming to Nigeria matters enormously. Our relationship with this country has been one of the most important in the history of the Ford Foundation.”</p>



<p>She also praised the Ford Foundation’s Office of West Africa team and its leadership under Dr ChiChi Aniagolu‑Okoye, Regional Director, for strengthening the Foundation’s impact in the region.</p>



<p>“At critical moments in history, the Ford Foundation has stood up for justice and democratic values, even under pressure,” Gerken said.</p>



<p>She commended the Foundation’s board for continuing to support work that defends democracy, the rule of law, and human rights worldwide, despite increasing global challenges.</p>



<p>Gerken concluded by thanking guests for their insights and hospitality, calling her conversations in Nigeria deeply energising. “From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I will be coming back very soon,” she said.</p>



<p>Also speaking at the dinner, the 16th Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, commended the Ford Foundation for its sustained support to Nigeria, noting that its interventions are helping to ease social and economic hardships in local communities.</p>



<p>“Nigeria is proud of Ford and grateful for what the Foundation is doing,” he said. “In the past, social challenges in many local areas were reflected in troubling data. Today, because of these interventions, those numbers are beginning to fall.”</p>



<p>While acknowledging Nigeria’s challenges, Sanusi said the country remains a land of opportunity due to its population, natural resources, and long-term potential.</p>



<p>Drawing on his experience as a traditional ruler, he said that living closely with communities had given him a firsthand understanding of their struggles.</p>



<p>“That is why I value the Ford Foundation’s efforts to reach people at the grassroots and improve their lives,” he said.</p>



<p>Sanusi also warned that global funding cuts have real human consequences.</p>



<p>“Every time a dollar is cut, it is a human being that is affected — through lost nutrition, health care, maternal and child services, education, and security,” he said.</p>



<p>He commended the Foundation for maintaining its support despite shrinking global resources and appealed for continued engagement.</p>



<p>“This is a period of darkness, but we will see the light if people like you continue to shine a torch into the grey areas,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thousands of students flooded the Athletic Oval of the University of Ghana (UG) on Valentine’s Day as Telecel Ghana’s TurnUp delivered the biggest campus party to climax Akwaaba Week for freshers.</p>



<p>Headlined by top music stars Black Sherif, Kweku Smoke, and Kidi, the campus blast also featured a surprise international performance by acclaimed Jamaican dancehall artist Popcaan.</p>



<p>The night officially opened with Afrofusion duo Lali X Lola, who set the pace for the evening with an energetic performance.</p>



<p>Shortly after, the five UG students shortlisted for the Telecel Next TurnUp Star challenge took turns competing for the GH¢10,000 grand prize across the music and dance categories. </p>



<p>The competition, which saw dozens of entries on Instagram and TikTok, gave student performers the opportunity to share the spotlight with the headline acts and compete for prize money before thousands of their peers. </p>



<p>The crowd cheered and adjudged Kelalie and Pentop winners of the music and dance categories, respectively.</p>



<p>“It feels amazing to win the Telecel Next TurnUp Star challenge, and I’m thankful to all who pushed and supported me,” said Kelalie, the music category winner and third-year Public Administration and Information Studies major. </p>



<p>“As a recording artiste and student, this is the best opportunity to put myself out there and show other students the talent I have.”</p>



<p>Afropop singer, KiDi, leaned into the Valentine’s theme with a set built around his popular love songs, drawing sing-alongs and concluding his performance by gifting flower bouquets to two female fans.</p>



<p>The energy shifted from romance to ‘hustle anthems’ when Kweku Smoke emerged. The Agyekum hitmaker’s high-energy performance resonated strongly with Gen Z, many of whom recited the lyrics to his songs word for word.</p>



<p>The defining moment of the night came during Black Sherif’s performance. Dressed in an all-pink suit and matching cap, the award-winning artist lit up the audience as they sang along every word from his hit music catalogue. </p>



<p>Performing songs from both of his chart-topping albums, Black Sherif paused mid-set to introduce the biggest surprise of the night, Popcaan.</p>



<p>The pair performed their collaboration “Celebrate,” which prompted one of the loudest reactions of the evening and shifted the event from a campus party to an international showcase.</p>



<p>Throughout the night, active students on Telecel School SIM received prizes and gifts from Telecel and its brand partners, with MC Kojo Manuel announcing winners between performances.</p>



<p>Several students walked away with high-value devices and home appliances, including an iPhone 17, a Hotwav Cyber 16 Pro, rice cookers, blenders, a fridge, a laptop and dinner tickets. Others also won freebies from Indomie, Coca-Cola, Minimie, Bel Aqua, Didi Shito and Close Up.</p>



<p>Telecel TurnUp extended beyond the main stage. A two-day Telecel Cashless Bazaar enabled students to purchase food and clothing using Telecel Cash, while Telecel Service Clinics on campus handled SIM registrations and assisted with SIM-related issues.</p>



<p>Director of Enterprise Business and Wholesale, Tawa Bolarin, said TurnUp is an appreciation of the telecom operator’s partnership with university communities.</p>



<p>“Telecel TurnUp is about celebrating the loyalty of thousands of students who rely on the network through our tertiary bundles. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are proud to have created this moment at UG, and we look forward to taking the TurnUp experience to even more campuses across the country,” Ms Bolarin said. </p>



<p>“If your university is on the Telecel tertiary package, it could host the next TurnUp.”</p>



<p>Since its launch in 2021, Telecel TurnUp has become a recurring fixture on Ghana’s campus entertainment calendar, with previous editions held at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, and the University of Energy and Natural Resources, Sunyani.</p>



<p>Third-year Political Science and English student, Theresa, said her expectations were exceeded. “I have been at Legon for three years, and I have never seen this kind of turnout. When Blacko brought out Popcaan, the whole place just exploded. I also liked that it wasn’t only about the big artistes. It felt like Telecel really came for the students.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Rescue teams combing through the backcountry of California&#8217;s Lake Tahoe region say they have found the bodies of eight skiers who went missing in an avalanche on Tuesday.</p>



<p>The search for a final missing skier continues, but that person is presumed dead, Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a news conference on Wednesday.</p>



<p>Officials said one of the deceased was the spouse of someone on one of the search-and-rescue teams, making continued rescue efforts &#8220;challenging emotionally&#8221;.</p>



<p>Fifteen skiers were reported missing on Tuesday after a &#8220;football-field&#8221; sized avalanche came barreling down in the Castle Peak area around 11:30 PST (19:30 GMT). Six have been rescued.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to offer my condolences to the family in this very trying time,&#8221; Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo said on Wednesday.</p>



<p>The bodies of the eight dead skiers are still trapped in the snow and can&#8217;t yet be recovered due to &#8220;pretty horrific&#8221; conditions, officials said.</p>



<p>Since the avalanche, another 3ft (.9m) of snow has fallen on the area, Tahoe National Forest supervisor Chris Feutrier said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The hazard remains high,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Once the bodies are recovered, they will be transported to the Placer County morgue.</p>



<p>Families of the deceased have been notified. Authorities have not yet released any of their names.</p>



<p>Sheriff Woo said the rescue operation was a joint effort involving two teams and roughly 50 crew members who had to traverse &#8220;extreme weather conditions&#8221; using specialised equipment.</p>



<p>At 17:30 local time on Tuesday, search teams arrived to an area roughly two miles (3.2km) from where survivors were sheltering in make-shift tents, and had to ski in from there.</p>



<p>Two of the six survivors had to be carried back and &#8220;could not walk because of the injuries they sustained during the avalanche&#8221;, Sheriff Moon said. They were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.</p>



<p>Among the survivors, one was a guide and five were clients of the Blackbird Mountain guided tour.</p>



<p>The entire ski group consisted of a mix of 11 recreational skiers and four ski guides.</p>



<p>The avalanche on Tuesday occurred as they were making their way back at the end of a three-day trip.</p>



<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom&#8217;s office said in a post on X that state authorities were &#8220;co-ordinating an all-hands search-and-rescue effort&#8221; with local emergency teams.</p>



<p>Conditions on Wednesday remained dangerous, multiple officials said, with Woo describing the climate as &#8220;treacherous&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Avoid the back country,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Please allow us to focus all of our resources on continuing to recover these bodies for the family and bring them home.&#8221;</p>



<p>The avalanche that trapped the skiers was rated as a D2.5 on a scale of D1 to D5, Sierra Avalanche Center Forecaster Steve Reynaud told local outlet ABC News 10.</p>



<p>The Boreal Mountain Ski Resort, which is near where the accident occurred, has reported over 30in (76cm) of snowfall since Tuesday.</p>



<p>The resort decided to close on Tuesday because of high winds and low visibility.</p>



<p>The storm has also closed several highways, including Interstate 80 and Highway 50.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;Do not give away Diego Garcia,&#8221; US President Donald Trump has said as he criticised the UK&#8217;s plan to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back an important military base.</p>



<p>Trump said &#8220;this land should not be taken away from the UK&#8221; and if it did it would be &#8220;a blight on our Great Ally&#8221;, in a post on social media.</p>



<p>This comes despite&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgrz2v98z0ro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington on Tuesday giving its official backing</a>&nbsp;to London&#8217;s plan to cede sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory to Mauritius.</p>



<p>In response to Trump, the UK Foreign Office said the Chagos Islands deal was &#8220;crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base,&#8221; it said in a statement.</p>



<p>Trump&#8217;s latest comments come ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week.</p>



<p>Diego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used as a joint military base by the UK and US armed forces.</p>



<p>Under the deal<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">,<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9dqg3nqynlo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> announced last May,</a> the UK will lease back Diego Garcia for </span>99 years.</p>



<p>Posting on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump wrote: &#8220;I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The US president stressed that Diego Garcia was &#8220;strategically located in the Indian Ocean&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.&#8221;</p>



<p>And referring to ongoing US-Iran talks on Tehran&#8217;s controversial nuclear programme, Trump said: &#8220;Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia&#8230; in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Republican president has repeatedly threatened to use military action against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities.</p>



<p>The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.</p>



<p>Asked by the BBC about Trump&#8217;s latest comments, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: &#8220;The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration, it&#8217;s coming straight from the horse&#8217;s mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;When you see it on Truth Social, you know it&#8217;s directly from President Trump; that&#8217;s the beauty of this president in his transparency and relaying this administration&#8217;s policies.&#8221;</p>



<p><br>But on Tuesday,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgrz2v98z0ro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the US Department of State gave its official backing to the planned handover&nbsp;</a>of the Chagos Islands.</p>



<p>In a statement, it said it &#8220;supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago&#8221;.</p>



<p>Trump&#8217;s position on the issue has seen rapid U-turns in recent months &#8211; from describing the planned transfer as an &#8220;act of great stupidity&#8221; to saying the deal was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yx1wedww2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the &#8220;best&#8221; the prime minister could make.</a></p>



<p>Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said Trump&#8217;s latest comments was &#8220;an utter humiliation&#8221; for Starmer.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time Starmer finally saw sense, U-turned and scrapped this appalling deal altogether,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump&#8217;s latest change in position showed that the UK needed to pursue closer ties with Europe.</p>



<p>&#8220;Trump&#8217;s endless flip-flopping on the Chagos Islands shows why Starmer&#8217;s approach is doomed to fail,&#8221; Davey wrote in a post on X.</p>



<p>&#8220;Britain can&#8217;t rely on the US while Trump is in the White House. It&#8217;s time to strengthen our ties with allies we can depend on, starting with our neighbours in Europe.&#8221;</p>



<p>Last month, Reform leader Nigel Farage &#8211; an outspoken critic of the UK handover plan &#8211; praised Trump&#8217;s earlier criticism of London&#8217;s handling of the issue.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank goodness Trump has vetoed the surrender of the Chagos islands,&#8221; Farage wrote on X.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, four Chagos islanders &#8211; who are opposing the handover deal &#8211; landed on the Chagos Islands&#8217; remote atoll as part of a protest against the deal.</p>



<p>They refused to leave it, despite a threat of eviction by a British maritime patrol.</p>

<p>Former Defence Minister and Bimbilla MP Dominic Nitiwul has criticised President John Mahama over what he describes as a gap in Ghana’s security leadership</p>



<p>He warned that the continued absence of a substantive Defence Minister is exposing weaknesses in the country’s security architecture.</p>



<p>His comments follow the recent terrorist attack on Ghanaian tomato traders in Burkina Faso, an incident he says requires urgent, high-level intervention from the Defence Ministry.</p>



<p>According to Mr Nitiwul, the scale and cross-border nature of the attack demand focused leadership, intelligence coordination and direct engagement with authorities in Burkina Faso, responsibilities he insists fall squarely within the mandate of a Defence Minister.</p>



<p>He argued that leaving the position without a substantive occupant risks weakening Ghana’s preparedness at a time when the West African sub-region is facing heightened security threats.</p>



<p>“I just think that the Ghanaian government must be explaining to us what happened, the circumstances,” he said. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/ghanaians-death-toll-in-burkina-faso-terror-attack-now-8/">Read also: Ghanaians death toll in Burkina Faso terror attack now 8</a></li>
</ul>



<p>“They&#8217;ve come out officially with some statement, but we want a detailed explanation, either by the Foreign Minister or by the Defence Minister.”</p>



<p>He maintained that by now, a Defence Minister should have travelled to Burkina Faso with a team to engage counterparts and oversee investigations.</p>



<p>“That’s why I kept on calling that the President should have appointed a Defence Minister, because by this time the Minister for Defence should have been on the flight to Burkina with his team,” he stated.</p>



<p>Mr Nitiwul stressed that the responsibility does not lie with the Interior Minister, noting that internal security oversight ends at Ghana’s borders.</p>



<p>“This is not the job of the Interior Minister. He’s my friend. Unfortunately, that’s not his job. If he goes there, he’ll go and meet the Defence Minister. It’s the soldiers who are fighting the terrorists. It’s not the Interior Minister’s job,” he said.</p>



<p>He further argued that it is the duty of the Defence Minister, working with defence intelligence and national security structures, to set up a team to investigate what happened, establish the circumstances leading to the attack and recommend measures to prevent a recurrence.</p>

<p>Ghana’s private capital and investment industry is entering a new phase of ecosystem strengthening, following Switzerland’s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO)’s deeper engagement in SME financing through the Ghana Investment Support Programme (GhISP). </p>



<p>With SECO joining forces with British International Investment under GhISP, the partnership is reinforcing the work of the Ghana Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (GVCA) to unlock long-term capital for small and medium-sized enterprises and build a more resilient private capital market in Ghana.</p>



<p>At a high-level stakeholder gathering in Accra, the GVCA underscored the urgent need for stronger coordination across debt, credit, equity and technical support platforms to accelerate SME growth and attract long-term capital.</p>



<p>The Chief Executive Officer of the association, Amma Gyampo, described the emerging partnerships as a turning point for Ghana’s SME financing architecture.</p>



<p>“It’s really critical for us to see more collaboration in the SME financing space between debt, between credit, between equity and support systems, support programmes like the Ghana Investment Support Programme,” she said.</p>



<p>The GhISP, powered by British International Investment and supported by SECO, is designed to strengthen investment readiness and expand deal flow to underserved SMEs in Ghana. </p>



<p>The initiative places particular emphasis on gender-smart investing, diversity-lens strategies and climate-aligned finance. For the venture capital community, the programme signals more than technical assistance. It represents a coordinated attempt to elevate the broader private capital ecosystem.</p>



<p>“I think it’s so exciting for us to see a collaboration of this nature, so we can actually elevate some of the ecosystem activities already ongoing to develop our venture capital and private equity managers, to develop their funds, to make the policy environment much friendlier for us to build a very resilient and competitive financial ecosystem,” Ms Gyampo noted.</p>

<p>The event brought together development finance institutions, private capital funds, transaction advisers, SMEs and ecosystem partners. Representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the British High Commission, the Swiss Embassy, as well as BII and SECO, reaffirmed their commitment to private sector development as a driver of inclusive growth.</p>



<p>Ghana’s SME sector remains the backbone of the economy, accounting for a significant share of employment and enterprise activity. Yet access to long-term, patient capital continues to constrain expansion, innovation and competitiveness. </p>



<p>Industry players argue that bridging the financing gap requires coordinated policy reform, stronger fund management capacity and increased local capital mobilisation.</p>



<p>Ms Gyampo stressed that the collaboration could serve as a catalyst for deeper capital allocation to indigenous businesses.</p>



<p>“We’re very excited to have this collaboration come to fruition, and we see this as being a great catalyst for even more support to increase the allocation of funding available for our local companies through our own local investment funds and our fund managers,” she said.</p>



<p>By aligning technical assistance with investment strategies, GhISP aims to drive measurable development impact while crowding in private capital. The programme focuses on pipeline development, capacity building for fund managers and SMEs, and improving the overall investment climate to attract both domestic and international investors.</p>



<p>For GVCA, the long-term objective is clear: to build a resilient and competitive financial ecosystem capable of channelling sustainable capital into growth-ready enterprises.</p>



<p>Ultimately, as Gyampo emphasised, the goal is “to fuel the growth of our SMEs, our small businesses, our medium-sized businesses in particular, which are ripe for investments of this nature.”</p>



<p>With global development partners reinforcing Ghana’s private capital framework, stakeholders believe the country is better positioned to unlock the full potential of its SME sector and strengthen its role as a competitive investment destination in West Africa.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Former Defence Minister Dominic Nitiwul has sharply criticized President John Dramani Mahama over the prolonged absence of a substantive Defence Minister, warning that Ghana’s security architecture is being exposed amid rising regional threats.</p>



<p>Speaking on the floor of Parliament on Wednesday, he said the recent terrorist attack on Ghanaian tomato traders in Burkina Faso that killed eight highlights the urgent need for focused leadership at the Defence Ministry.</p>



<p>He argued that the cross-border nature and scale of the attack require a fully mandated Defence Minister to coordinate investigations, intelligence, and a decisive national response.</p>



<p>“I just think that the Ghanaian government must be explaining to us what happened, the circumstances. I think the government has not yet come out. They&#8217;ve come out officially with some statement, but we want a detailed explanation either by the Foreign Minister or by the Defence Minister,” he said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NITIWUL-SUBSTANTIVE.mp3-online-audio-converter.com_.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>He stressed that the Defence Minister, rather than the Interior Minister, should have led the response:</p>



<p>“That’s why I kept on calling for the President to appoint a Defence Minister, because by this time the Minister for Defence should have been on the flight to Burkina with his team. This is not the job of the Interior Minister… the Interior Minister’s job ends at Paga on the border.</p>



<p>&#8220;It doesn’t go beyond the border. It’s the duty of the Minister for Defence, with defence intelligence and National Security, to have gone there, set up a team, investigate, and ensure that they find out the circumstances that led to it and how to prevent it from happening again,” he explained.</p>



<p>Mr Nitiwul warned that leaving the Defence Ministry without a substantive occupant risks weakening intelligence coordination and undermining Ghana’s preparedness at a time of heightened regional instability.</p>

<p>The Mfantsipim Old Boys Association (MOBA) has officially commenced activities toward the historic celebration of the 150th Anniversary of Mfantsipim with a Pre-Launch press briefing held at the MOBA Secretariat in Accra. </p>



<p>The ceremony, held as part of the structured build-up to the school’s sesquicentennial celebration, convened distinguished alumni, members of Mfantsipim School&#8217;s Governing Council, revered faith leaders, representatives of the Ghana Education Service (GES), and members of the Anniversary Planning Committee.</p>



<p>The Pre-Launch press briefing follows an earlier milestone occasion, the official unveiling of the 150th Anniversary logo, a powerful visual identity that encapsulates the heritage, values, and forward-looking aspirations of Mfantsipim School.</p>



<p>Delivering remarks at the briefing and representing the Presiding Bishop of the Methodist Church in Ghana, Rt Rev Emmanuel Borlabi Bortey reflected on Mfantsipims’ enduring role in shaping Ghana’s moral, intellectual, and leadership landscape. </p>

<p>He emphasised virtues such as integrity, humility, diligence, accountability, and purposeful leadership as the moral compass guiding generations of Mfantsipim alumni.</p>



<p>President of the 150th Anniversary Planning Committee, Captain John B. Yamoah, described the forthcoming celebration as “a remarkable milestone that will be etched permanently in the annals of Ghanaian history.” He noted that the sesquicentennial is not merely a commemoration of longevity, but a moment of reflection, renewal, and recommitment to the school’s founding ideals.</p>



<p>He also announced that the official unveiling of the 150th Anniversary commemorative cloth will take place on March 20th at Wesley Towers in Accra, calling on distinguished members of the MOBA fraternity to proudly adorn the anniversary cloth as a visible symbol of unity, heritage, and collective pride, ensuring dignified representation befitting the Mfantsipim brand.</p>



<p>Captain Yamoah also cautioned against any misrepresentation of the school’s name, emphasising that the institution remains Mfantsipim School, or simply Mfantsipim, and should not be inaccurately referred to as “Mfantsipim Senior Secondary” or “Mfantsipim Senior High.” </p>



<p>He underscored that the Mfantsipim brand is singular, historic, and irreplicable, and must be treated with the reverence it commands.</p>



<p>Also addressing the gathering, the Director-General of the Ghana Education Service, Prof. Ernest Kofi Davis, reaffirmed the Service’s steadfast commitment to strengthening second-cycle education across Ghana. </p>



<p>He recognised Mfantsipim School as one of the nation’s foremost torchbearers of academic excellence, acknowledging its profound contribution to the nation’s intellectual and leadership landscape over the past century and a half. </p>



<p>He further called on old students across all second-cycle institutions to actively support their alma mater, particularly in the areas of academic advancement and infrastructure development, to ensure sustained excellence within Ghana’s educational landscape.</p>



<p>In his remarks, the Headmaster of Mfantsipim School, Prof. Ebenezer Aidoo, described the institution as a model of discipline and holistic learning, committed to nurturing not only intellectual excellence but also moral character and civic responsibility.</p>



<p>As the School approaches its sesquicentennial climax in Cape Coast, Mfantsipim at 150 stands as both a celebration of legacy and a renewed commitment to faith, excellence, and purposeful leadership, true to its timeless call, Dwen Hwe Kan.</p>
