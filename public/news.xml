										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Member of Parliament for Damongo and Ranking Member on Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, Samuel Abu Jinapor, has disputed claims that Ghana’s newly commissioned Chancery in Addis Ababa is solely the achievement of the current administration.</p>



<p>In a<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1223802136543464&amp;set=a.537872435136441" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook post</a> titled <em>“Setting the Records Straight on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1223802136543464&amp;set=a.537872435136441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghana’s Addis Ababa Chancery</a>”</em>, Mr Jinapor described comments made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, at the commissioning ceremony as “erroneous” and an “egregious misrepresentation of facts”.</p>



<p>The new Chancery, located in Addis Ababa, was recently commissioned amid public commendation of the government’s efforts to strengthen Ghana’s diplomatic presence in Ethiopia.</p>



<p>However, Mr Jinapor insisted that construction of the project began under the administration of former President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.</p>



<p>According to him, the sod-cutting ceremony was performed by President Akufo-Addo on 10th February, 2020 on the sidelines of the African Union Summit.</p>



<p>The event, he said, was witnessed by then Ethiopian President Sahle-Work Zewde and other senior officials from both Ghana and Ethiopia.</p>



<p>Mr Jinapor, who stated that he was present at the ceremony, recalled that President Akufo-Addo had at the time lamented Ghana’s failure to own a chancery building in Addis Ababa, given the longstanding relations between the two countries dating back to the era of Kwame Nkrumah and Haile Selassie.</p>



<p>He rejected suggestions that the project had a 10-year history from 2016, describing such claims as misleading.</p>



<p>Construction, he maintained, commenced in February 2020, immediately after the sod-cutting and had reached about 90 per cent completion by October 2024.</p>



<p>Mr Jinapor further indicated that the only delay in the project’s completion was related to the final payment of the contract sum during the 2024 general elections period.</p>



<p>He argued that if there had been any interruption in progress beyond that point, it could not be attributed to the previous administration.</p>



<p>“This is a national project commenced by the previous Government and completed by the current Government,” he stated, adding that acknowledging continuity in governance should not be viewed as partisan.</p>



<p>He described it as disingenuous to characterise the chancery as a “Mahama project” when, according to him, the current administration only completed the remaining 10 per cent of the work.</p>



<p>Mr Jinapor urged the Foreign Affairs Minister, as the country’s chief diplomat, to acknowledge what he termed “unimpeachable facts” surrounding the project’s origins and execution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Founder and CEO of leading agribusiness firm, Agri-Impact Group, Dr. (h.c) Daniel Fahene Acquaye, has been appointed Chairman of the CSIR–Crops Research Institute (CRI) Management Board.</p>



<p>He was officially inducted into office on Thursday, February 19, 2026, in Kumasi.</p>



<p>In this role, Dr. Acquaye will lead an eight-member Board, providing strategic direction and governance oversight to one of Ghana’s foremost agricultural research institutions.</p>



<p>The board will, among other things, set and approve research priorities and policies, provide budget and financial management oversight, promote applied research and commercialisation, foster private sector partnership and enhance national visibility.</p>



<p>Dr. Acquaye’s appointment is seen as a strategic step toward strengthening research–industry collaboration and accelerating the commercialisation of agricultural innovation.</p>



<p>The Management Board includes:</p>



<p>Dr. Daniel Fahene Acquaye – CEO, Agri-Impact Group; Agribusiness Expert (Chairperson)<br>Dr. Baffour Asafo-Agyei – Retired Crops Research Scientist and Plant Breeder with local and international experience (Member)<br>Mr. Kojo Akoto Boateng – Consultant, Farmer, and Media Personality (Member)<br>Dr. Solomon Ansah – Director of Crop Services, MoFA (Member)<br>Prof. Marian Quain – Deputy Director-General, CSIR (Member)<br>Dr. Collins Tay – Director, CSIR–Soil Research Institute (Member)<br>Prof. Maxwell Darko Asante – Director, CSIR-CRI (Member)<br>Mr. Emmanuel Afriyie – Lawyer and Head of Administration, CSIR-CRI (Secretary to the Management Board)</p>



<p>About Dr. Daniel Fahene Acquaye</p>



<p>A distinguished agribusiness development and value chain expert, Dr. Daniel F. Acquaye brings on board over three decades of experience in enterprise development, youth empowerment, and agricultural transformation across Africa and the Caribbean.</p>



<p>He has consulted for leading global institutions, including the Mastercard Foundation, Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), USAID, ECOWAS, GIZ, AGRA, IFAD, UNDP, the African Development Bank, and the African Union, among others, with assignments spanning over 30 countries.</p>



<p>A key highlight of his career has been advancing Ghana’s medicinal and natural plant products onto the global stage through science-based and market-driven partnerships.</p>



<p>Through his subsidiary, Agribusiness in Sustainable Natural African Plant Products (ASNAPP), which began as a USAID-funded initiative operating in five African countries, he established strong collaborations with academic and research institutions such as Rutgers University (USA), Stellenbosch University (South Africa), KNUST, and other partners.</p>



<p>These partnerships led to ethnobotanical research, the establishment of a Genebank at KNUST, the cultivation of Cryptolepis for the Centre for Scientific Research into Plant Medicine, and the commercialisation of products such as kombo butter, Lippia herbal tea, grains of paradise, Xylopia, miracle berries, and Artemisia annua.</p>



<p>Within four years, exports of medicinal plants under the initiative increased from $3 million to $25 million, significantly expanding Ghana’s presence in international markets.</p>



<p>Dr. Acquaye also pioneered greenhouse farming models as part of a modern, climate-smart agribusiness strategy. Through ASNAPP and later Agri-Impact Ventures (now Agri-Impact Group), greenhouse production systems were introduced and scaled to support women, youth, and persons with disabilities, supplying high-quality vegetables to premium domestic and international markets.</p>



<p>Today, Agri-Impact Group manages greenhouse farms under its Fresh Logistics subsidiary, promoting technology adoption, year-round production, and youth employment.</p>



<p>In recognition of his exceptional contribution to youth empowerment and agribusiness development, he was recently honoured by the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) with a Doctor of Science (Honoris Causa) degree.</p>



<p>Under his leadership, Agri-Impact Group has mobilised over $100 million in agricultural project funding in the past five years, employs more than 150 staff, and is currently leading a transformative Mastercard Foundation–supported programme aimed at creating over 300,000 jobs for youth in Ghana, alongside supporting a World Bank–funded SME growth initiative in Jamaica.</p>



<p>His company has also partnered with the Ministry of Trade, Agribusiness and Industry (MoTAI) and other sector players to develop a National Agribusiness Policy for Ghana, and with the Ministry of Food and Agriculture to develop a Poultry Masterplan and a policy framework for the rice sector.</p>



<p>Dr. Acquaye’s new role at CSIR–Crops Research Institute positions him at the intersection of research, commercialisation, governance, and national development, an opportunity to further drive innovation, strengthen institutional performance, and advance Ghana’s green growth and agricultural transformation agenda.</p>

<p> The project which formed part of the Foundation&#8217;s commitment to enhancing access to clean and safe drinking water in its host communities, and was aimed at addressing the long standing water challenges faced by the people of Mehuntem.</p>



<p>Speaking during the commissioning , the executive secretary of the Gold Fields Ghana Foundation , Abdel Razak Yakubu revealed that as the time line of handing over the Damang mines over to government draws close , Gold Fields Ghana will continue to be present and assist its host communities;</p>

<p>&#8221; ..

<p>The facility consists of a concrete pedestal and the provision of a 40, 000 litre storage tank to serve the community; &#8220;..individuals can connect the water to their various homes . The assembly has assisted with the provision of chlorine to treat the water and it is very heartwarming that Gold Fields has been able to provide water supply systems for all its host communities it operate in , &#8221; Abdel Razak Yakubu reiterated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>King Charles III&#8217;s brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, has been arrestedon suspicion of misconduct in public office.</p>



<p>Thames Valley Police confirmed it had arrested a man in his 60s in Norfolk on Thursday and was carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk. He remains in custody, it said.</p>



<p>King Charles III said the &#8220;law must take its course&#8221; in response to Andrew&#8217;s arrest and that the police had his &#8220;full and wholehearted support and co-operation&#8221;.</p>



<p>Police had previously said they were considering investigating Andrew over allegations relating to his association with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and were reviewing allegations he shared confidential material.</p>



<p>Communications between the pair featured among the tranche of files released by the US government.</p>



<p>This is the first time Andrew has been arrested. He has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing.</p>



<p>Thames Valley Police said that, following a &#8220;thorough assessment&#8221;, a formal investigation had now been opened.</p>



<p>It also said earlier in February that it was assessing a separate allegation that a second woman was sent to the UK by Epstein for a sexual encounter with Andrew in 2010. The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time.</p>



<p>BBC News understands that Thames Valley Police contacted the Home Office to give them advance warning before Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested.</p>



<p>The arrest, which took place at Sandringham at 08:00 GMT on Thursday, is not in relation to any allegations of sexual offences.</p>



<p>Vehicles believed to be unmarked police cars were seen outside the King&#8217;s Norfolk estate, where the former prince has been living since leaving his home in Windsor, in Berkshire.</p>



<p>The BBC understands that Royal Lodge &#8211; Andrew&#8217;s former home in Windsor Great Park &#8211; is being searched by police. A number of uniformed officers have been seen beyond the gates.</p>



<p>Thames Valley Police said it was not naming the arrested man &#8220;as per national guidance&#8221;, and warned that as the case was now active, care must be taken to avoid being in contempt of court.</p>



<p>Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said: &#8220;We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Norfolk Constabulary told the BBC it was &#8220;supporting a Thames Valley Police investigation into misconduct in a public office&#8221;.</p>



<p>The former Duke of York served as the UK&#8217;s trade envoy between 2001 and 2011, travelling globally and enjoying privileged access to senior government and business contacts around the world.</p>



<p>In 2010, Andrew appears to have forwarded government reports from visits to Vietnam, Singapore and China to Epstein, files relating to the late financier recently released by the US Department of Justice appear to show.</p>



<p>The documents also appear to show Andrew forwarded information on investment opportunities in gold and uranium in Afghanistan to Epstein.</p>



<p>Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.</p>



<p>King Charles said he learned of the news his brother&#8217;s arrest with the &#8220;deepest concern&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.</p>



<p>&#8220;As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.&#8221;</p>



<p>The BBC understands that the Prince and Princess of Wales support the King&#8217;s statement.</p>



<p>It is also understood that neither the King nor Buckingham Palace were given advance warning of Andrew&#8217;s arrest, which occurred on his 66th birthday.</p>



<p>The royals have been maintaining a business-as-usual approach, opting to continue with their engagements, despite the extraordinary developments of this morning.</p>



<p>The King, who had been attending a solo engagement to mark the start of London Fashion Week on Thursday, did not react to questions from reporters asking for his reaction to his brother&#8217;s arrest.</p>



<p>Queen Camilla was asked about the arrest of her brother-in-law as she left an engagement in Windsor on Thursday.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you concerned about Andrew&#8217;s arrest, your Majesty?&#8221; the Queen was asked as she got into a waiting car outside a lunchtime orchestral concert at Sinfonia Smith Square Hall. She was seen waving but did not respond.</p>



<p>Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing over his association with Epstein. He has not responded to the BBC&#8217;s requests for comment on the specific allegations in relation to the release of millions of Epstein files in January.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has told the BBC that he has submitted a five-page letter to several UK police forces providing new and additional information from the Epstein files.</p>



<p>In a statement, Brown says the new information is in addition to what he submitted to the forces last week, in which he &#8220;expressed my concern that we secure justice for trafficked girls and women&#8221;.</p>



<p>The brother of the late Virginia Giuffre, Sky Roberts has told BBC Newsnight that he believes his sister had been &#8220;vindicated&#8221; by news of Andrew&#8217;s arrest.</p>



<p>The former prince previously faced allegations from Virginia Giuffre, which were settled out of court.</p>



<p>She alleged she was made to have sex with Andrew on a number of occasions, including on Epstein&#8217;s private island Little St James in the early 2000s.</p>



<p>The settlement reached between the two made no admission of wrongdoing on Andrew&#8217;s part.</p>



<p>Despite acknowledging the reasoning behind Andrew&#8217;s arrest as &#8220;not a direct correlation&#8221; to Virginia&#8217;s allegations, Roberts heralded the moment as a &#8220;win for survivors&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t be here without her (Virginia). We wouldn&#8217;t be to a moment [sic] where this would have been investigated to this point&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Roberts also commended the King for his support of the investigation by Thames Valley Police, adding: &#8220;I say thank you to the King and to the Royal Family for standing behind survivors&#8221;.</p>



<p>Andrew stepped back from royal duties in 2019 as he said the allegations had become a &#8220;disruption&#8221; for the royal family.</p>



<p>He subsequently lost his military titles and royal patronages as Giuffre brought a civil action against him in the US in 2022.</p>



<p>Andrew was stripped of his princely title in October 2025, the same month Giuffre&#8217;s posthumous memoir was published and as fresh details about his association with Epstein came to light.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Centre for Democratic Development Ghana (CDD-Ghana) has urged sweeping institutional reforms to strengthen Ghana’s anti-corruption architecture, warning that the first year of the John Dramani Mahama administration shows both encouraging steps and significant gaps.</p>



<p>In its one-year governance assessment released on Thursday, February 19, the civil society organisation called for the urgent establishment of an Independent Anti-Corruption and Ethics Commission to consolidate the work of existing accountability bodies.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana recommended implementing the Constitutional Review Committee’s proposal to merge the currently fragmented mandates of the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO), and the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) into a single independent body.</p>



<p>The think tank argued that the present structure weakens coordination and effectiveness in tackling corruption.</p>



<p>It further proposed removing the Attorney-General’s prosecutorial authority over corruption cases and transferring that power to the proposed independent commission.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana also called for legal safeguards to prevent political interference in prosecutions.</p>



<p>“Ensure that the Attorney-General or any person exercising prosecutorial authority may not discontinue a commenced prosecution without leave of court,” the report recommended.</p>



<p>Beyond structural reforms, the organisation stressed the need for sustained financing of accountability institutions.</p>



<p>It urged the government to “provide adequate and sustained funding for accountability institutions, moving beyond rhetorical commitments to actual transfer of budgetary allocations.”</p>



<p>The report warned that chronic underfunding has historically undermined Ghana’s anti-corruption efforts.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana also pressed the government to fast-track the long-delayed Conduct of Public Officers Bill.</p>



<p>According to the group, the proposed law must contain “comprehensive provisions on ethics, asset disclosure, and conflict of interest” to close existing loopholes in the governance framework.</p>



<p>The think tank further called for robust implementation of the National Ethics and Anti-Corruption Action Plan (NEACAP 2026–2030), cautioning against repeating the shortcomings of the previous NACAP I.</p>



<p>In its overall assessment, CDD-Ghana acknowledged what it described as promising early signals by the Mahama II administration, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Limiting ministerial appointments</li>



<li>Launching a Code of Conduct for appointees</li>



<li>Supporting the OSP</li>



<li>Initiating asset recovery efforts</li>
</ul>



<p>However, it stressed that the administration’s flagship “Reset” agenda will ultimately be judged by concrete outcomes rather than policy announcements.</p>



<p>“The test of the ‘Reset’ agenda will not be in rhetoric but in concrete institutional reforms, consistent enforcement, and the political will to apply accountability standards uniformly across all actors in government,” the report concluded.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana pledged to continue monitoring the government’s performance, noting that citizens who have vested sovereignty in the administration expect measurable progress in the fight against corruption.</p>

<p>He cautioned prize winners to remain vigilant and avoid fraud, stressing that Ecobank would not call or request sensitive personal information before customers can access their rewards.</p>



<p>The initiative has been widely welcomed by traders, particularly market women, with many describing it as a timely intervention that motivates them to save regularly while enjoying tangible benefits.</p>



<p>The promotion underscores Ecobank’s commitment to enhancing financial inclusion and rewarding customer loyalty across Ghana.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ghana Police Service has arrested a 39-year-old man described as a suspected narcotics kingpin following an intelligence-led operation in the Bono Region.</p>



<p>The suspect, identified as David Frimpong, was apprehended by officers from the Berekum Divisional Police Command at Nyamebekyere, a suburb within the Berekum Municipality.</p>

<p>According to a police statement issued on Thursday, February 19, officers acting on intelligence stormed the suspect’s residence — a semi-completed building — where he was believed to be operating from. Mr Frimpong reportedly attempted to flee upon sighting the police but was swiftly apprehended.</p>



<p>A thorough search of the premises uncovered what authorities described as significant quantities of suspected narcotic substances and materials used in drug preparation and distribution.</p>

<p>Police disclosed that the search yielded:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Seven compressed slabs of dried leaves suspected to be Indian hemp</li>



<li>195 wraps of dried leaves</li>



<li>Three sacks containing additional quantities of dried leaves believed to be Indian hemp</li>



<li>A container of ‘groundnut cake’ toffee suspected to have been mixed with Indian hemp</li>



<li>Six pairs of scissors</li>



<li>Fourteen packs of cigarettes</li>



<li>190 wrapping papers</li>
</ul>

<p>All items have been retained for evidential purposes and will undergo forensic examination to confirm their composition.</p>



<p>Preliminary investigations suggest that Mr Frimpong is a dealer in narcotic drugs and is believed to have been distributing the substances within Berekum and surrounding communities.</p>

<p>The suspect remains in police custody as investigations continue. Authorities say preparations are underway to process him through the legal system, where he is expected to face charges relating to possession of narcotic drugs without lawful authority.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana) has raised concerns over the application of pre-trial detention and bail procedures under the administration of John Dramani Mahama, citing significant public controversy and allegations of abuse of discretionary powers by investigative bodies.</p>



<p>In its one-year assessment of the Mahama administration, the policy think tank noted that the handling of arrests, detention and bail conditions—particularly in high-profile political cases—has generated debate about fairness, due process and the potential for institutional overreach.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>EOCO Under Scrutiny</strong></h3>



<p>The report highlights complaints from several suspects, many of whom served as appointees under the previous New Patriotic Party (NPP) administration led by former President Nana Akufo-Addo.</p>



<p>According to CDD, some of these individuals felt that the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) had abused its discretionary authority to detain suspects and impose bail conditions.</p>



<p>The matter reached a crescendo during the arrest and detention of the NPP’s Ashanti Regional Chairman, Bernard Antwi Boasiako, widely known as Chairman Wontumi. </p>



<p>His case, which attracted significant public and political attention, became emblematic of wider concerns about investigative discretion and perceived partisan application of the law.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Legal Gaps and Risk of Abuse</strong></h3>



<p>While existing legislation allows decisions by investigative bodies to be challenged in court, CDD argues that the current framework still leaves room for potential abuse. </p>



<p>The organisation warned that without clearer statutory safeguards, the exercise of powers relating to arrest, bail and remand may continue to provoke controversy and erode public confidence in the justice system.</p>



<p>The report emphasised that the perception of unequal or politically motivated application of the law can undermine democratic stability and trust in state institutions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CRC Proposals as a Remedy</strong></h3>



<p>As part of its recommendations, CDD pointed to proposals made by the Constitutional Review Commission (CRC), which it believes offer a pathway to reform.</p>



<p>Among the key suggestions is the passage of comprehensive legislation by Parliament to regulate arrest procedures, bail conditions, pre-trial detention and remand. Such a law would establish clear timelines and defined grounds for exercising these powers, thereby limiting arbitrary or prolonged detention.</p>



<p>The CRC further recommends the establishment of a similar statutory framework to guide prosecutions, ensuring consistency, transparency and accountability across the criminal justice process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Call for Parliamentary Action</strong></h3>



<p>CDD urged lawmakers to consider these proposals carefully, arguing that codifying clear standards would protect individual rights while preserving the legitimate powers of law enforcement agencies.</p>



<p>The think tank noted that strengthening legal safeguards in the pre-trial process is essential not only to protect suspects’ rights but also to reinforce public confidence in Ghana’s democratic institutions.</p>

<p>The Concerned Drivers Association of Ghana and other unions have commended the Accra Mayor, Michael Kpakpo Allotey, for clearing hawkers off Kinbu-Tudu Street, a move that has significantly eased traffic congestion in the area.</p>



<p>The praise follows a meeting between the union and the mayor, during which drivers highlighted the challenges they faced with hawkers occupying the streets.</p>



<p>Nii Ashie, Greater Accra Regional Chairman of the Concerned Drivers Association of Ghana, told Adom News that the mayor had fulfilled his promise to clear the roads, bringing relief to drivers.</p>



<p>“The road was blocked during and after Christmas, but the mayor came through,” he said.</p>



<p>Paa Willie, President of the Concerned Drivers Association, also lauded the efforts of Mayor Allotey and President John Mahama, noting that the streets are now clear and drivers are no longer harassed by police officers.</p>



<p>“The Accra Mayor’s efforts have made a huge impact, and we appreciate his leadership,” he stated.</p>



<p>He added that major traffic jams during the Christmas season on Kinbu-Tudu Street and at Makola had made commuting extremely difficult, but the situation has improved remarkably.</p>



<p>Paa Willie also expressed admiration for how the Mayor managed to get the market women to relocate from the street, calling him a strong and effective leader.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana) has raised concerns about persistent violence, institutional weaknesses and unresolved legal gaps in Ghana’s presidential transition process, in its one-year assessment of the Mahama administration.</p>



<p>In its review of developments, CDD-Ghana observed that transitions in the Ghana Fourth Republic—particularly between the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC)—have historically been marred by violence, political reprisals and governance disruptions.</p>



<p>According to the report, the 2025 transition was “not different from previous ones”. It cites contestation and violence surrounding parliamentary results in several constituencies, including the destruction of Electoral Commission result sheets, assaults on poll workers and what it described as an ineffective police containment strategy.</p>



<p>The period leading up to the inauguration of President John Dramani Mahama was characterised, CDD noted, by fear and uncertainty.</p>



<p>As has become typical during transitions, the think tank said marauding groups of party-affiliated vigilantes illegally entered public institutions in attempts to remove outgoing political appointees or secure employment allegedly promised by the incoming administration.</p>



<p>One of the most striking incidents cited was the storming of the offices of Ghana National Gas Company on December 10, 2024, by NDC supporters. The situation reportedly required a combined deployment of police and military personnel, who fired warning shots to disperse the group.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana further noted that such incidents continued even after President Mahama was sworn into office. </p>



<p>On January 15, 2025, the organisation issued a public statement urging the new government and the NDC to disband vigilante groups and allow the police to maintain law and order.</p>

<p>“Typical of the history of presidential transitions, almost no one has been held accountable for clearly criminal acts,” the report stated.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Legal and Constitutional Gaps</h3>



<p>Beyond the violence, CDD-Ghana highlighted long-standing constitutional and legal weaknesses that continue to undermine effective state transitions.</p>



<p>Although the Presidential (Transition) Act, 2012 (Act 845) was enacted to sanitise and formalise the handover process, CDD argues that it has only partially achieved its purpose. </p>



<p>While transitions at the apex of government have become more orderly—with structured transition teams and cordial engagements between outgoing and incoming administrations—the same cannot be said for the broader machinery of state.</p>



<p>A major recurring issue, the report notes, is the practice of last-minute appointments, contracts and financial commitments by outgoing governments. In the 2025 transition, disputes arose over payments and recruitment undertaken during the transition window.</p>



<p>The incoming administration subsequently revoked what it termed “last-minute appointments” made after January 7, 2025, a move that significantly affected many newly recruited public sector workers, particularly unemployed youth.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Governance Disruptions at Local and Corporate Levels</h3>



<p>CDD-Ghana also pointed to structural governance gaps created by mass dismissals and abrupt directives during transitions. Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) were instructed to hand over to District Coordinating Directors upon the assumption of office by the new President. Similar directives were issued to boards and chief executives of public corporations.</p>



<p>While these actions are common during political transitions, CDD argues that they create operational paralysis.</p>



<p>The removal of MMDCEs, for instance, disrupts the functioning of District Security Councils and other local governance mechanisms. Likewise, dissolving boards and removing chief executives of state-owned enterprises can halt even purely commercial operations, sometimes with contractual and financial consequences.</p>



<p>In some cases, replacing a board, appointing a chief executive or confirming a new MMDCE can take six months to a year, compounding governance uncertainty.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Council of State and Presidential Appointments</h3>



<p>Another area of concern is the sequencing challenge created under the Presidential Office Act, 1993 (Act 463), which requires presidential staff appointments to be made in consultation with the Council of State.</p>



<p>Incoming presidents typically prefer to constitute their own Council of State before making substantive appointments, meaning that key presidential staff often serve in an interim capacity for extended periods.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana believes these overlapping legal requirements contribute to avoidable governance delays at critical moments of state transition.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Proposed Reforms</h3>



<p>The organisation endorsed recommendations put forward by the Constitutional Review Committee (CRC), including proposals to amend Chapter Eight of the Constitution to restrict certain actions during the transition period—such as urgent appointments, contracts and financial commitments.</p>



<p>The CRC has also proposed fixed-term appointments for certain key officials that would not be coterminous with the President’s tenure, thereby reducing politicisation and disruption during transitions. </p>



<p>Additionally, the report recommends revising the Presidential (Transition) Act to extend its scope beyond the Presidency to encompass public and civil service and local government structures.</p>



<p>Further proposals include strengthening oversight of state enterprises through the State Interests and Governance Authority (SIGA), to ensure continuity and accountability.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Call for Institutional Maturity</h3>



<p>CDD-Ghana warned that unless structural reforms are undertaken, Ghana’s democratic transitions will continue to be accompanied by instability, economic risk and erosion of public confidence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Centre for Democratic Development Ghana (CDD-Ghana) has raised fresh concerns about press freedom and the pace of anti-corruption reforms in its one-year assessment of the John Dramani Mahama administration.</p>



<p>In the report released on Thursday, February 19, the civil society group warned that the government has yet to fulfil key promises aimed at expanding civic space and strengthening the accountability framework.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana criticised what it described as the government’s failure to initiate the repeal of “all anti-press freedom laws” to reverse what it called a growing climate of fear and intimidation.</p>



<p>According to the organisation, there are worrying signs that the repealed criminal libel regime may be returning through the use of the publication of false news provision under the Criminal Offences Act.</p>



<p>The report noted that some cases that appear to be straightforward defamation disputes are being pursued as criminal matters by state security agencies.</p>



<p>“This is concerning because defamation matters must be tackled through civil action taken by respective aggrieved persons, whether they are public officials or not,” the assessment stated.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana cautioned that the involvement of security agencies in such cases is “undesirable because it often leads to the gagging of citizens and the shrinking of civic space.”</p>



<p>The think tank warned the trend could have a chilling effect on investigative journalism and whistleblowing activities if not urgently addressed.</p>



<p>On broader governance reforms, CDD-Ghana acknowledged the government&#8217;s decision to transition from the first National Anti-Corruption Action Plan (NACAP I) to the new framework, the National Ethics and Anti-Corruption Action Plan (NEACAP).</p>



<p>The group described the move — and the placement of the new framework under the Office of the President — as commendable and potentially capable of strengthening oversight.</p>



<p>However, it stressed that success would depend heavily on implementation.</p>



<p>“The proof will be in implementation,” the report emphasised, warning that the same challenges that weakened NACAP I — particularly underfunding and weak political commitment — must be “genuinely addressed, not just rhetorically.”</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana also pointed to delays in passing the long-promised Conduct of Public Officers Bill into law.</p>



<p>While acknowledging the launch of a Code of Conduct for Appointees, the organisation said the absence of a comprehensive legislative framework means a key manifesto pledge remains unfulfilled.</p>



<p>Analysts say the bill is widely viewed as central to tightening rules on conflicts of interest, asset declaration, and ethical standards in public office.</p>



<p>The latest assessment adds to ongoing debate about the government’s record on transparency, media freedom and institutional reform.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana is urging authorities to accelerate legislative action, safeguard press freedoms, and ensure the new anti-corruption framework is properly funded and backed by strong political will.</p>



<p>Observers say the coming months will be critical in determining whether the administration can convert policy commitments into measurable governance gains.</p>

<p>A few days ago, Hon. Eric Edem Agbana, the Member of Parliament for Ketu North and a member of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Education, raised a red flag that every Ghanaian parent, teacher, and citizen should pay attention to. He called out the &#8220;dehumanising content&#8221; in one of our Social Studies textbooks for Junior High School students- specifically, a section that attempts to list the &#8220;benefits&#8221; Ghana derived fromcolonisationn.</p>



<p>For far too long, our educational system has allowed a dangerous narrative to fester: the idea that while colonisation was &#8220;tough,&#8221; it gave us roads, schools, and a legal system. This is a historical lie that we have swallowed for decades. It is a narrative that sanitises a crime against humanity. To suggest that colonisation had &#8220;well-intended benefits&#8221; is like thanking a thief for leaving a flashlight behind after emptying your house so he could see his way to the door. We must be clear: colonisation was an extractive, dehumanising business venture that was never meant to develop the African, but to deplete the African for the benefit of Europe. It is time we deconstruct this myth and take back the minds of our children.</p>



<p><strong>Economic Exploitation: The Infrastructure of Extraction</strong></p>



<p>The most common argument used to defend the colonial era is the infrastructure left behind. People point to the railways, the Takoradi ports, and the roads built by the British. But we must ask ourselves: why were they built?</p>



<p>If you look at the map of the colonial railway system, it doesn&#8217;t connect our people; it connects the resource-rich hinterlands to the coast. The railway was not built so that a trader in Kumasi could easily visit a relative in Accra. It was built to move gold, timber, and cocoa out of the country as fast as possible. The ports were not gateways for Ghanaian trade; they were exit points for our wealth.</p>



<p>This infrastructure was the machinery of a massive extraction project. To call these &#8220;benefits&#8221; is to ignore the motive. Like a farmer who fattens a chicken before the slaughter, the colonialists built only what was necessary to make the extraction of our riches more efficient. They didn&#8217;t prioritise local industries; in fact, they suppressed them to ensure we remained a market for their finished goods. This created a cycle of economic dependence that we are still struggling to break today. True development could have been achieved through equal cooperation and trade integration if the Europeans actually meant well, but their goal was expansion and domination, not partnership.</p>



<p><strong>Social Disruption: The Birth of the Identity Crisis</strong></p>



<p>Colonisation did not just take our gold; it tried to take our souls. It disrupted the very fabric of our social structures and governance. Before the &#8220;District Commissioner&#8221; arrived, we had sophisticated systems of accountability and communal living. The British replaced these with foreign laws and an &#8220;Indirect Rule&#8221; system that often turned our own leaders into puppet proxies for the Empire.</p>



<p>The most damaging part of this social disruption was the war on our identity. This is where the deep-seated inferiority complex in our society began. Our agents of socialisation- the schools, the churches, and the media-were used to tell us that everything African was &#8220;heathen,&#8221; &#8220;primitive,&#8221; or &#8220;backward.&#8221;</p>



<p>Think about the schools. Girls were forced to cut their hair to look &#8220;neat&#8221; according to Western standards, and our traditional clothing was demoted to &#8220;Friday wear&#8221; or something &#8220;informal.&#8221; We were taught to speak English with a certain accent to prove we were &#8220;civilised,&#8221; while our mother tongues were labelled as &#8220;vernacular&#8221;, and students were punished for speaking them. This was a deliberate foundation for neocolonialism. It taught the Ghanaian to hate his own reflection and exalt the white man&#8217;s lifestyle. We are now living in a society with a massive identity crisis, where we idolise the American lifestyle and Western capitalism without realising that these systems were often built on our backs.</p>



<p><strong>A suicidal Liberal Democracy, Political Oppression and the Illusion of &#8220;Development</strong></p>



<p>Ghana’s liberal democracy, codified in the 1992 Constitution, is a neocolonial-influenced document that forces the nation to adopt the political end-state of the West without its prerequisite economic foundation. Critically, no developed nation, from the United Kingdom and the United States to the &#8220;Asian Tigers&#8221; like South Korea and Singapore-achieved industrialization under a liberal democratic framework. Historically, these powers utilized centralized, one-party, or illiberal systems to enforce the structural discipline and long-term planning necessary for economic takeoff. They only adopted democratic pluralism after securing economic sovereignty.</p>



<p>In Ghana, however, this model was externally mandated through aid conditionalities, compelling the nation to &#8220;run&#8221; politically before it could &#8220;walk&#8221; economically. This has resulted in a &#8220;winner-takes-all&#8221; culture that fosters chronic &#8220;short-termism&#8221; and paralysing polarisation. While the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) is mandated by Act 479 to create long-term frameworks, these are routinely sacrificed for four-year electoral gains.</p>



<p>Successive administrations abandon vital national projects to satisfy partisan bases, ensuring that progress is perpetually reset with every change of government.</p>



<p>By clinging to this neocolonial relic, Ghana remains trapped in a cycle of dependency. The current democratic structure prioritises procedural &#8220;good governance&#8221; over the radical, disciplined mobilisation of resources required for true transformation. Until the nation reconciles its governance with the historical reality that development demands a period of concentrated, centralised focus, its full potential will remain suppressed by the very institutions designed to mirror Western ideals rather than Ghanaian realities.</p>



<p>Politically, Ghanaians were subjugated and denied basic rights in their own land. Any form of resistance was met with brutality. The &#8220;development&#8221; the colonial authorities spoke of was always biased. While they built schools like Achimota, the curriculum was designed to produce clerks, administrative assistants, and low-level officials-proxies who would help the British run the colony. They didn&#8217;t want to produce independent thinkers, engineers, or innovators who would challenge the system.</p>



<p>Even the infrastructure built in the hinterlands, which people often credit to the colonial government, was frequently the work of third-party altruistic groups like churches. And even then, much of it was tied to indoctrination- convincing the African that his salvation lay in a foreign culture.</p>



<p>The system was rigged from the start. Today, we hear people preaching about &#8220;willpower&#8221; and &#8220;hard work&#8221; as the only way to succeed. While hard work is good, we must realise that many of our systemic issues are not individual failures; they are systemic symptoms. People are struggling to make it in a system designed to hold them back. We have inherited a structure of &#8220;every man for himself&#8221; individualism that is the opposite of our communal roots.</p>



<p>This roadmap represents a radical departure from the neocolonial structures that have defined Ghana since the transition to the Fourth Republic. To reach our full potential, we must deconstruct the procedural &#8220;benefits&#8221; of a democracy that serves foreign interests and replace them with a decade of intentional mental liberation.</p>



<p><strong>THE ROADMAP: A PERIOD OF MENTAL LIBERATION</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Radical Curricular Deconstruction:</strong> We must purge the educational system of colonial-centric narratives that prioritise Western triumph. In alignment with the Education Act, 2008 (Act 778), we must shift from rote learning to critical consciousness. Students must study the Pan-Africanism of Kwame Nkrumah, the dependency theory of Walter Rodney, and the revolutionary humanism of Steve Biko and Patrice Lumumba to replace individualistic capitalism with communal self-worth.</li>



<li><strong>Reclaiming Socialisation Agents: </strong>Family, Religious and media institutions must be reoriented. Under Article 39(1) of the Constitution, the State is mandated to integrate customary values into national life. We must enforce proper family values, demand an end to the religious demonisation of indigenous spiritualities and utilise the media to flood the public sphere with communal values, ensuring that the &#8220;agents of socialisation&#8221; serve the national interest rather than foreign ideologies. This includes the strategic regulation of digital spaces, moving beyond the Electronic Communications Act, 2008 (Act 775, to actively filter content that contradicts the national agenda of mental liberation and cultural protection.</li>



<li><strong>Decolonising Teacher Pedagogy: </strong>Teacher training colleges must become laboratories for mental liberation. Teachers, as the primary architects of the national psyche, must be incentivised to deconstruct the &#8220;colonial mentality&#8221; that equates Westernisation with progress. They must be the frontline soldiers in dismantling the psychological chains of neocolonialism.</li>



<li><strong>Communalism over Individualistic Monopolies:</strong> We must dismantle the &#8220;big man&#8221; culture and the neoliberal monopolies that exploit the masses. Our goal is to produce practical humanists- politicians, leaders, engineers, doctors, and artists who view their competence and skills as tools for communal upliftment rather than personal accumulation at the expense of their neighbours.</li>



<li><strong>Constitutional Indigenisation: </strong>We must overhaul the 1992 Constitution to move beyond the &#8220;hybrid&#8221; Westminster-Washington model. This involves the formal integration of the Chieftaincy Act, 2008 (Act 759) into the legislative process, transforming the Council of State into a powerful chamber for traditional authorities to ensure that national laws reflect the indigenous &#8220;spirit&#8221; and ancestral wisdom rather than foreign legal transplants.</li>



<li><strong>Linguistic Sovereignty: </strong>Language is the carrier of culture. We must elevate Ghanaian languages from mere subjects to the primary media of instruction and official state business. By breaking the hegemony of English, we allow our people to think, innovate, and govern in the languages that carry our communal logic, thereby ending the alienation of the masses from the state.</li>



<li><strong>Economic Protectionism and Autarky: </strong>We must reject the neoliberal &#8220;open market&#8221; lies that keep us as raw material exporters. The state must aggressively protect local industries and prioritise intra-African trade, deconstructing the myth that &#8220;foreign direct investment&#8221; is the only path to prosperity. True potential lies in self-reliance and the strategic control of our own markets.</li>



<li><strong>The &#8220;enslaved psyche&#8221;</strong><br>This is a colonial byproduct where &#8220;evolutionary thrift&#8221; triggers a cognitive bias toward familiar stagnation. This psyche clings to the 1992 Constitution, fearing the risk of radical change. However, uprooting these structures without a &#8220;map&#8221; -a rigorous transitional governance framework-invites &#8220;Hobbesian strife,&#8221; where a power vacuum leads to state collapse. To avoid anarchy, we mustutilisee the Chapter 25 amendment architecture to transition from liberal democracy to indigenous communalism. This &#8220;map&#8221; ensures that dismantling neocolonial relics is a structured evolution toward our ancestral identity, preventing the chaos of a vacuum-led revolution.</li>
</ol>



<p>Conclusively, colonisation was a scourge, not a blessing. The &#8220;roads and railways&#8221; were just the chains used to haul our wealth away. We owe it to the next generation to ensure they do not grow up with the same inferiority complexes that have hindered our progress for so long.</p>



<p>We must be the ones to restamp our own identity. Our toils might not result in a perfect system within our lifetime, but we must do the work. The &#8220;house&#8221; (the global class system) is rigged, but our answer lies in unity and a conscious, deliberate effort to shape what our children believe about themselves. As the 1992 Constitution of Ghana suggests in Articles 25 and 38, the state has a duty to provide education that leads to the &#8220;full realisation&#8221; of rights and facilities. That realisation is impossible if the mind is still in colonial chains. It is time for a total mental overhaul. Let us start by recalling those books.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The former Chief Executive Officer of the defunct Menzgold Ghana Limited, Nana Appiah Mensah, also known as NAM 1, has told the High Court that the Bank of Ghana (BoG) advised his companies on their operational structure. </p>



<p>He is standing trial for allegedly using his companies to induce and defraud over 16,000 members of the public. </p>



<p>Appearing in the witness box to give his side of the story, NAM 1 was questioned by his lawyer, Paa Joy A. Boateng, during examination-in-chief about the incorporation status and licensing of Menzgold Ghana Limited.</p>



<p>The accused explained that Menzgold, originally incorporated as Menzbank Ghana Company Limited, intended to operate as the first “bullion” bank in West Africa, if not the entire continent.</p>



<p>In pursuit of this vision, NAM 1 told the court that the BoG had issued a publication listing Menzbank among unlicensed microfinance institutions.</p>



<p>“In response, Menzbank’s in-house counsel wrote to the BoG, citing the publication in the dailies and informing them that Menzbank was not a microfinance institution, requesting that our name be expunged from the list,” he said.</p>



<p>He added that the Central Bank responded by requesting supporting documents and invited him to a meeting.</p>



<p>“As a law-abiding entity, we submitted the Precious Minerals Marketing Company (PMMC) licence and all other documentation they requested, which they acknowledged. </p>



<p>&#8220;Menzgold was subsequently given an opportunity in the meeting, chaired by Mr Amoh Awuah and other officers of the Central Bank, to adequately address the issues, which we did to the best of our ability,” NAM 1 said, noting that the company was then known as Menzbank.</p>



<p>He further explained that the meeting resolved the mistaken listing of Menzbank as an unlicensed microfinance institution, attributing it to the name’s suggestion of a financial institution.</p>



<p>NAM 1 told the court that the Central Bank advised a slight adjustment to the company’s name.</p>



<p>“So more specifically, our team and that of the Central Bank collectively resolved that Menzbank with a ‘k’ would be changed to Menzbanc with a ‘c’ to ensure consistency, which is a cardinal element in business administration. So Menzbank was changed to Menzbanc on the advice of the BoG,” he said.</p>



<p>He further testified that BoG later convened a second meeting after several months to address public confusion over whether Menzbanc was a licensed financial institution.</p>



<p>“This was because the name ‘Menzbanc’ depicted a financial institution, and members of the public often called the Central Bank to enquire. Secondly, our gold jewellery products and tablets, which buyers could trade for extra value, gave the semblance of financial investment,” he explained.</p>



<p>After discussions, the Central Bank instructed that for the companies to operate without confusion, the sale of gold jewellery products should be separated from gold trading operations.</p>



<p>“In effect, it was the Bank of Ghana that advised the setting up of Brew Marketing Consult,” NAM 1 said.</p>



<p>The case has been adjourned to March 5, 2026, for further examination-in-chief.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>



<p>NAM 1 and two of his companies, Menzgold Ghana Limited (MGL) and Brew Marketing Consult Ghana Limited (BMCGL), face 39 charges, including selling gold without a licence, operating a deposit-taking business without a licence, inducement to invest, defrauding by false pretence, fraudulent breach of trust and money laundering.</p>



<p>The allegations relate to defrauding customers of various sums between 2016 and 2018, totalling GH¢340,835,650. NAM 1 has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is on bail of GH¢500 million with four sureties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A new one-year assessment of the Centre for Democratic Development Ghana (CDD-Ghana) has flagged what it describes as a major loophole in the government’s anti-corruption framework, warning that the GH₵20,000 gift threshold for ministers could weaken accountability safeguards.</p>



<p>In its evaluation of the John Dramani Mahama administration released on Thursday, February 19, the civil society organisation said the current limit set under the Code of Conduct for ministers is “alarmingly high” and risks opening the door to undue influence.</p>



<p>According to CDD-Ghana, allowing ministers to receive gifts valued up to GH₵20,000 without triggering serious scrutiny creates what it termed “significant loopholes for potential corruption&#8221;.</p>



<p>The think tank argued that international best practice typically favours much lower thresholds or outright bans on high-value gifts to public officials, especially those involved in procurement and policy decisions.</p>



<p>The organisation further expressed concern over what it described as the President’s inaction on mounting calls for a review of the threshold.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana noted that the continued silence on proposals to reduce the cap “partly undermines the credibility of the Code&#8221;, particularly at a time when public trust in anti-corruption efforts remains fragile.</p>



<p>Analysts say the issue has become a litmus test for the administration’s broader commitment to tightening ethical standards in public office.</p>



<p>Beyond the gift threshold debate, the report also pointed to delays in passing the long-anticipated Conduct of Public Officers Bill, describing the hold-up as a missed opportunity to strengthen Ghana’s accountability architecture.</p>



<p>The bill, if enacted, is expected to provide a more comprehensive legal framework governing conflicts of interest, asset declarations, and ethical conduct among public officials.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana warned that without the legislation, reforms risk remaining largely administrative rather than legally enforceable.</p>



<p>Anti-corruption advocates say the concerns raised could fuel renewed public debate about transparency standards within government, especially as Ghana continues to pursue fiscal consolidation and governance reforms.</p>



<p>The Mahama administration has repeatedly pledged to strengthen accountability systems, but civil society groups maintain that closing policy loopholes — including the gift threshold — will be critical to demonstrating tangible progress.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana is urging the government to review the cap urgently and fast-track the Conduct of Public Officers Bill to reinforce public confidence in the country’s anti-corruption regime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), Dr. Jacob Paarechuga Anankware, surprised many people when he arrived at work riding a motorcycle.</p>



<p>Dressed in a formal suit and a certified helmet, Dr. Anankware carefully rode into the EPA premises. Staff and visitors quickly noticed his arrival, and conversations followed about leadership, simplicity, and safety on the roads.</p>



<p>Many described the moment as unusual for a senior public official, but also refreshing. Others praised him for wearing full protective gear and setting a good example for riders.</p>



<p>Speaking on the reason behind his motorcycle ride, Dr. Anankware explained that it was not a special or symbolic action.</p>



<p>“Periodically, I ride to work,” he said. “Riding makes me feel alert and improves my concentration. It also helps me appreciate other road users who are not in my position. Finally, it helps me get to work early, and I am able to move quietly without attention.”</p>



<p>He confirmed that the ride was not a one-time decision, adding that riding to work is part of his normal routine. “There was nothing special about today. It is one of my routines,” he said.</p>



<p>Although Dr. Anankware said he was not trying to promote a policy message, he noted that motorcycles generally use less fuel and can help reduce carbon emissions compared to bigger vehicles.</p>



<p>“Bikes use less fuel, and this has a catalytic effect on the carbon footprint left by big vehicles,” he explained, while stressing that he does not expect all government officials to ride motorcycles because of safety concerns and personal choice.</p>



<p>When asked if motorcycle use can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions in cities, his answer was, “definitely.”</p>



<p>He said the EPA is already leading efforts to promote green energy and cleaner alternatives. “We promote alternatives to fossil fuels because of their effects on the ozone layer, global warming, oceans, plants, animals, and even human survival on planet Earth,” he said.</p>



<p>Dr. Anankware explained that Ghana’s long-term plan is to achieve net-zero energy-related emissions by 2060, as outlined in the Ghana Energy and Investment Plan (2023–2060).</p>



<p>He added that in 2024, the government waived import duties on electric vehicles meant for commercial transport until 2032. According to him, John Dramani Mahama has also shown leadership by driving an electric car, a move he says has helped increase the number of electric vehicles in the country.</p>



<p>Dr. Anankware said road safety was one of the reasons he rode with a helmet. “Wearing a helmet is a basic requirement. It protects the rider from head injury in case of an accident,” he said.</p>



<p>He called for strict enforcement of helmet laws and sent a message to commercial motorbike riders, commonly known as Okada riders.</p>



<p>“My humble plea to all riders is to wear a helmet at all times, even for short distances. You never know when an accident will happen. The brain is the most important part of the body. Any injury to it can kill or permanently damage you.”</p>



<p>Dr. Anankware believes public officials should live in ways that match national goals. “Public officials should demonstrate simple and responsible living,” he said, praising President Mahama’s modest lifestyle and leadership style.</p>



<p>He also highlighted serious air pollution concerns, citing data from the World Health Organization (WHO), which shows that Accra is one of Africa’s fastest-growing cities, with road transport contributing a large share of fine air pollution.</p>



<p>“These statistics are worrying. It will take collective effort,” he said, calling on all Ghanaians to support efforts to protect the environment and reset the economy.</p>

<p>Security expert Dr. Ishmael Norman has called on President John Dramani Mahama to appoint a woman as Ghana’s next Minister of Defence, highlighting the reputational and policy benefits such a move would bring.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on<strong> JoyNews’ The Pulse</strong>, Dr. Norman argued that it is time for Ghana to break the tradition of men occupying the Defence Ministry and for the President to select a capable female leader who understands policy, parliamentary procedures, and budgeting in the defence sector.</p>



<p>“It will be for reputational benefit, and this thing will be so high up before all women, all girls, that it will be amazing the benefits of that appointment. We are tired of men; appoint a woman, Mr. President. Please, please, appoint a woman,” he appealed.</p>



<p>On the specific female candidate he proposes, Dr. Norman named the Korle Klottey MP Dr. Zanetor Agyemang Rawlings. He highlighted her experience on the Defence and Interior subcommittee, the Intelligence subcommittee, and her participation in activities at the Ghana Armed Forces Staff College.</p>



<p>“She has quite a lot of qualifications,” he said. “She has proven her worth as a medical doctor, parliamentarian, and disciplined professional.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is not an iota of any bad thing said about her. She has been groomed for that role, and it is high time she is elevated to that position.”</p>



<p>Dr. Norman also referenced Ghana’s affirmative action law, noting that women should occupy at least 25% of top positions in every organization, a target that has not yet been met in the defence sector.</p>



<p>He urged patience, however, acknowledging that the final decision rests with President Mahama and the Council of State, and emphasised the importance of careful consultation before appointing the next Defence Minister.</p>



<p>When asked about Deputy Defence Minister Ernest Bronya Genfi, Dr. Norman described him as being careful and diplomatic in his role, particularly given the sensitive circumstances surrounding the ministry.</p>



<p>He praised him for his professionalism and commitment, noting that any future appointment would require the consultation of the President, the Council of State, and the military leadership.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A proposed Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill triggered heated exchanges in Parliament, as the government moves to restructure Ghana’s national security architecture and change the name of the National Investigations Bureau (NIB) back to Bureau of National Intelligence (BNI).</p>



<p>The bill, laid before Parliament by the Minister for the Interior, Muntaka Mohammed-Mubarak, on Thursday, February 19, seeks to address what the government describes as public confusion between the National Investigations Bureau (NIB) and the National Investment Bank, which share the same acronym.</p>



<p>Under the proposed law, the intelligence agency will revert to the name Bureau of National Intelligence (BNI), distinct from its former historical title, Bureau of National Investigation.</p>



<p>The bill also proposes a major restructuring of national security governance by scrapping the Ministry for National Security, with oversight functions to be exercised through the Presidency.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="956" height="625" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka.png" alt="Majority, Minority clash over bill to revert NIB name to BNI and overhaul national security structure" class="wp-image-10032982379" title="Majority, Minority clash over bill to revert NIB name to BNI and overhaul national security structure" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka.png 956w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-300x196.png 300w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-768x502.png 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-459x300.png 459w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-214x140.png 214w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-150x98.png 150w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-218x143.png 218w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-649x424.png 649w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-330x216.png 330w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-225x147.png 225w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-217x142.png 217w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-340x222.png 340w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-229x150.png 229w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-55x36.png 55w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 956px) 100vw, 956px" /></figure>



<p>Presenting the bill, Mr. Mohammed-Mubarak argued that the reforms are necessary to streamline coordination and avoid institutional conflicts.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, we have a situation where you say NIB, people are wondering whether you are talking about the bank or the security agency. So one of the significant things we are trying to do is to reintroduce the name BNI… Bureau of National Intelligence,” he said.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ss_ZNTT1Hk?si=-12jpZMRYoBro-V8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>He added that the new structure is intended to prevent conflict between a Minister for National Security and the National Security Coordinator, stressing that coordination should be firmly anchored under the President with ministerial oversight rather than a standalone ministry.</p>



<p>However, the proposals immediately drew strong opposition from the Minority, who described the bill as flawed, overly centralising power, and lacking safeguards.</p>



<p>Former Defence Minister, Dominic Nitiwul, questioned the policy rationale behind the reforms, warning that the changes could create instability and weaken accountability.</p>

<p>“If in four years you are no more in power, are we expecting a new government to also bring a new Act to reflect their direction?” he asked.</p>



<p>“It will be dangerous for this nation to make that office and agency so powerful without proper accountability. It’s a misplaced priority, and if you do that, you’ll suffer.”</p>



<p>Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin also rejected the bill, arguing that it is politically motivated rather than driven by evidence-based governance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="982" height="617" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin.png" alt="Majority, Minority clash over bill to revert NIB name to BNI and overhaul national security structure" class="wp-image-10032982385" title="Majority, Minority clash over bill to revert NIB name to BNI and overhaul national security structure" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin.png 982w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-300x188.png 300w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-768x483.png 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-477x300.png 477w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-223x140.png 223w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-150x94.png 150w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-218x137.png 218w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-675x424.png 675w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-330x207.png 330w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-225x141.png 225w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-217x136.png 217w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-340x214.png 340w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-239x150.png 239w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Afenyo-Markin-55x35.png 55w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" /></figure>



<p>“The memorandum before us does not provide any empirical evidence to suggest that Act 1030 has failed,” he said.</p>



<p>“So much power is being given to the coordinator, and it is not clear how his powers are going to be fettered. </p>



<p>&#8220;Without clear responsibility, accountability and oversight, this becomes problematic. When citizens’ rights are abused, it will be justified in the name of national security.”</p>



<p>He called for further consultations and amendments to incorporate concerns raised by the Minority.</p>

<p>Responding to the criticism, the Majority Leader, Mahama Ayariga, defended the bill, describing it as a correction of what he termed a “historical wrong” created by the previous administration.</p>



<p>“We decided to cut down the number of ministers, and among the ministries we guillotined was the Ministry for National Security,” he said.</p>



<p>“What you [NPP] did was to force the hand of a President to appoint a Minister for National Security. It was a wrong thing for us to have done as a Parliament, and this historical wrong has to be corrected.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Director-General of the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC), Dr Audrey Smock Amoah, has emphasised the need for strict compliance with planning guidelines and improved performance standards to ensure that development plans translate into tangible results.</p>



<p>Delivering a presentation on Plan Preparation, Annual Progress Reports (APRs), and the Regional Integrated Plan, on Thursday, 19th February 2026, Dr Amoah highlighted L.I. 2232, which governs the preparation of APRs. She commended the Eastern Region for its strong performance, noting that most APRs submitted last year were rated excellent, very good, or good.</p>



<p>However, she stressed that rankings alone are not enough.</p>



<p>“We want to get to a point where, apart from the rankings, when we step into the districts or the regions, we see actual development,” she stated, explaining that APRs must comprehensively capture annual activities, financial performance, implementation challenges, and recommendations for improvement.</p>



<p>Dr Amoah further announced that several districts had successfully secured certification of their development plans, while others were yet to address outstanding review comments.</p>



<p>“We are still waiting for you to address your comments so that you receive your certificates,” she urged, applauding compliant districts and noting that the Regional Coordinating Council had also attained certification.</p>



<p>On her part, the Eastern Regional Minister, Rita Akosua Adjei Awatey, underscored the importance of coherent and well-aligned development planning, cautioning against the persistent challenge of abandoned projects.</p>



<p>“Where there is one consolidated, comprehensive, and collectively owned development plan, the likelihood of project abandonment significantly reduces,” she said.</p>



<p>Earlier, the NDPC team paid a courtesy call on the President of the Eastern Regional House of Chiefs, who underscored the critical need for a long-term, sustainable approach to development. Reflecting on agricultural practices, he observed that while farmers may sell their produce to the highest bidder today, such short-term gains could prove costly in the future.</p>



<p>“In ten years, the farmers could be the poorest,” he cautioned, stressing that true growth must safeguard future livelihoods rather than focus solely on immediate profits.</p>



<p>He emphasised that sustainable development remains key to ensuring lasting economic progress for communities across the region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minister for Sports and Recreation, Kofi Adams, says legislation of Ghana&#8217;s sports fund is not enough to drive growth in the sector without real financial commitment.</p>



<p>Speaking in Parliament on Thursday, 19 February, Mr Adams said passing the Sports Fund Bill must be matched with practical investment if Ghana is to unlock the economic potential of sport.</p>



<p>He made the remarks as the country prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, where Ghana has been drawn in Group L alongside Panama, England and Croatia. The tournament, which begins in June, will be the Black Stars’ fifth appearance on football’s biggest stage.</p>



<p>Mr Adams said funding would be central to Ghana’s participation.</p>



<p>“Ghana has qualified for the World Cup; funding will be a key component for our participation and it is in that spirit, Speaker, I make this statement,” he said.</p>



<p>He warned that law alone cannot transform the industry.</p>



<p>“Legislation alone does not finance sports, commitment does. Globally, the sports industry exceeds $500 billion in value yet on our continent, sports contribute less than 0.5% to GDP in most countries &#8211; not because we lack talent, not because we lack passion but because we have not yet built a financing system that matches our ambition.”</p>



<p>According to the minister, the proposed Ghana Sports Fund would provide a transparent and accountable framework to support infrastructure development, school and grassroots sport, elite athlete preparation, welfare systems and recreation.</p>



<p>“The Ghana Sports Fund provides us that system. It creates a transparent and accountable framework to support infrastructural development, school and grassroots sports, elite athlete preparation welfare systems and recreation,” he added.</p>



<p>Mr Adams also commmended the National Investment Bank for donating 100,000 Ghana cedis to the fund, describing the gesture as a demonstration of leadership from the financial sector.</p>



<p>He said meaningful reform in Ghana’s sports industry would depend not only on Parliament passing the bill, but on sustained financial backing from both government and private institutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Deputy National Communications Director of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Kamal-Deen Abdulai, has questioned the clarity and application of Article 146 of Ghana’s 1992 Constitution, describing it as potentially “the most confused position” in the supreme law at the moment.</p>



<p>Article 146 of the 1992 Constitution outlines the procedures and grounds for the removal of justices of the superior courts and other high-ranking officials on the basis of stated misbehaviour or incompetence.</p>



<p>Speaking on the Joy News AM Show on Thursday, 19th February, Mr Abdulai raised concerns about what he suggested could be a selective interpretation of the constitutional provision governing the removal of certain public officers, including the Chief Justice.</p>



<p>“Is there a case of cherry-picking or selective application of the law here when it comes to Article 146 of the Constitution? It’s a question somebody would ask,” he said.</p>



<p>“Lawyers have also exposed their positions on what we heard yesterday and read. That looks like the most confused position of the Constitution at the moment is Article 146.”</p>



<p>Mr Abdulai noted that many legal commentators had weighed in on the matter, offering differing interpretations of what amounts to “stated misbehaviour”.</p>



<p>“Many people have actually been there. And some of these, when they come out, the legal pundits or legal luminaries will come out with their various angles. What actually constitutes a misbehavior is what the CJ is saying,” he stated.</p>



<p>Referring to a recent communication emanating from the Jubilee House, Mr Abdulai cited portions of what has been described as the “Green Letter,&#8221; which addressed a petition seeking a prima facie determination.</p>



<p>“That look, from what we have received and read, it is evident on the face of it that some constitutional questions were raised, administrative questions were raised, but they don&#8217;t meet the threshold to determine a prima facie case,” he said.</p>



<p>He added that a full publication of the reasoning behind the decision would be instructive.</p>



<p>“It will be interesting to have a full report. Because I know that when justices of their caliber sit, they don&#8217;t just write English. They derive their positions from laws; they derive their positions from determined cases, which are precedents. And they derive their positions from textbooks and all that.”</p>



<p>Mr Abdulai stressed that transparency in such high-level constitutional matters was crucial, particularly after the President had been furnished with the report.</p>



<p>“It’s just unfortunate what the law says. Whether after furnishing the President with it, the President would make it available for all of us to read, to get to know the ratio or the reasons behind the decision of the Chief Justice,” he said.</p>



<p>Quoting directly from the letter issued from the Presidency, he read, &#8220;While the allegations raised serious constitutional and administrative questions, they do not, on their face, meet the threshold required for a prima facie determination of stated misbehavior or incompetence, warranting that a committee be set up to inquire into the petition.”</p>



<p>“The petition largely rests on conclusions of unlawfulness and bad faith without establishing a preliminary level, clear facts, demonstrating intentional wrongdoing, or a manifest inability to perform constitutional functions,” he continued.</p>



<p>“Even if the commission&#8217;s actions or inactions are assumed to be erroneous, controversial, or suboptimal, such shortcomings do not automatically translate into stated misbehavior.”</p>



<p>Mr Abdulai argued that these conclusions had triggered broader public debate about consistency in applying Article 146, particularly in light of previous determinations by the Council of State.</p>



<p>“Thus, I’m saying that some lawyers, after reading this, say, At what point can a stated misbehavior actually be impugned?” he said.</p>



<p>“Not only lawyers, but commonsensical people would also say this. Because yesterday, we were told that same Article 146, Council of State, was able to establish, if you like, a prima facie case against not just anybody, but a certain Chief Justice.”</p>



<p>He contrasted the current reasoning with earlier cases where alleged breaches of administrative procedures, including travel policies, were said to have met the threshold for a prima facie case.</p>



<p>“And when ratios were asked to be given, we’re told that she traveled, and the travel policy was infringed upon. We’re told that there was some administrative infringement, and then if this one talks about some administrative questions and infringements, and yesterday was actually meeting the threshold of a prima facie, why not today?” he queried.</p>



<p>Mr Abdulai stated that his concerns were not directed at any particular institution.</p>



<p>“I’m not actually against the OSP or the EC, but I’m trying to say that our law should actually be so clear to us that it will not leave us in a state of confusion, as it were,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Chairman of the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC), Dr Nii Moi Thompson, has reiterated the need for a consolidated long term national development plan to replace Ghana’s fragmented and largely unimplemented past frameworks.</p>



<p>During the ongoing regional consultative engagement with key stakeholders in the Eastern Region on Thursday, 19 February 2026, Dr Thompson delivered a presentation on the proposed long term national development plan, emphasising the importance of a clear national vision and noting that policy discontinuity has undermined national progress.</p>



<p>He referenced previous initiatives such as Ghana Beyond Aid and Vision 2057, stressing that long term planning is not about predicting the future, but about defining goals and working systematically to achieve them.</p>



<p>“We cannot proceed with an incrementalist approach to development,” he noted, warning that without deliberate and sustained planning, Ghana risks stagnation.</p>



<p>He identified informality as “the weakest link” in the country’s development, observing that while 92 per cent of businesses operate in the informal sector and employ nearly 90 per cent of the workforce, they contribute only about 20 per cent to GDP due to low value addition.</p>



<p>Dr Thompson therefore urged district assemblies to prioritise economic formalisation, business development, and models such as the Start and Improve Your Business initiative to enhance productivity and competitiveness.</p>



<p>Dr Thompson also called for greater adoption of technology, particularly Artificial Intelligence, to modernise planning processes and improve efficiency.</p>



<p>He disclosed that the Commission has already begun exploring AI tools following a recent introductory session.</p>



<p>“It will help to minimise the workload and expedite certain processes for us,” he noted, adding that he has personally used AI to summarise district development plans effectively.</p>



<p>He expressed optimism that once fully institutionalised at the Commission level, the innovation would be extended to the regions and district assemblies.</p>



<p>Turning to governance and maintenance culture, he emphasised that development is not only about constructing new infrastructure but also about preserving existing assets. Drawing on the broken window theory, he cautioned that neglecting minor defects inevitably leads to systemic deterioration.</p>



<p>“The second you see this, you are supposed to prevent it,” he remarked, citing road encroachment, school erosion, and the destruction of pavements as examples of avoidable decline that ultimately place additional burdens on government resources.</p>



<p>The Regional Minister described the Commission’s long term national development plan as timely and commendable, emphasising that its success will depend on effective implementation, inclusivity, and accountability.</p>



<p>“A better tomorrow is dependent on our collective decisions and actions today,” she concluded, urging stakeholders to ensure that development remains people centred, strategic, and sustainable.</p>

<p>Ghana’s Minister for Sports and Recreation, Kofi Adams, says he will donate two months of his salary to the Ghana Sports Fund.</p>



<p>He made the announcement while speaking in Parliament, where he stressed the need for the Sports Fund Bill to be passed into law. He said the fund could make a strong contribution to Ghana’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and help transform sports financing in the country.</p>



<p>The minister made the pledge after commending the National Investment Bank for donating GHC 100,000 to the fund.</p>



<p>“I will donate two months of my salary to the Ghana Sports Fund effective February 2026,” Mr Adams said.</p>



<p>“If we expect the private sector to invest, if we expect (Sports) Federations to reform, if we expect young athletes to commit, then leadership must also commit.”</p>



<p>He also called on fellow lawmakers and government officials to support the initiative.</p>



<p>“I respectfully call on members of this house, Ministers of State and the Executive to support this fund in tangible ways. Government has delivered the framework,” he added.</p>



<p>The Ghana Sports Fund is designed to mobilise resources to support sports development, infrastructure, and athlete welfare across the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Majority Chief Whip in Parliament, Rockson Dafeamekpor, has promised to donate three months of his salary to help the growth of the Ghana Sports Fund. </p>



<p>The Ghana Sports Fund, passed into existence earlier this year, serves as the dedicated source of funding for the development of sports in Ghana.</p>



<p>The multi-source Sports Development Fund is designed to support athlete welfare, infrastructure development, grassroots sport, and systematic talent identification.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the National Investment Bank (NIB) made its first donation to the fund, expressing its commitment to the development of sports in the country. </p>



<p>That action has been followed by Dafeamekpor, who has also decided to donate to the fund.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Chief Whip has asked me to announce that he is committing three months of his salary [to the Ghana Sports Fund,&#8221; Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga said in Parliament on Thursday. </p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">‘I will invite the Special Prosecutor to come and find out how he’s going to survive for the three months’ – Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga jokes after his Chief Whip donated three months’ salary to the Sports Fund<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JoySports?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#JoySports</a> <a href="https://t.co/EY2zqOjjg1">pic.twitter.com/EY2zqOjjg1</a></p>&mdash; #JoySports (@JoySportsGH) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoySportsGH/status/2024512389937344642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>The bill’s passage marks a significant policy move aimed at addressing longstanding funding challenges in the sector, with government hopeful that the fund will provide a more structured and reliable source of support for Ghanaian sports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If the moral arc of a nation is to bend toward justice, the instruments of its political parties must first be tempered in the fires of integrity.</p>



<p>The National Democratic Congress has signaled that its commitment to the &#8220;Reset Ghana&#8221; agenda is not merely a pulpit for public consumption, but a mandate for internal purification.</p>



<p>By moving with surgical speed following the submission of a preliminary investigative report to the Functional Executive Committee, the party has transformed a localized inquiry into a national crusade for democratic sanctity.</p>



<p>​The directive, issued by General Secretary Fifi Fiavi Kwetey, marks a pivotal transition from reactive discipline to proactive reformation. What began as a specific probe into allegations of financial inducement during the Ayawaso East Constituency internal elections has now blossomed into a comprehensive overhaul of the party’s electoral culture.</p>



<p>The &#8220;canker&#8221; of vote-buying, as the party candidly describes it, is no longer being treated as a peripheral nuisance but as a systemic threat that requires the most formidable intellectual and political shielding.</p>



<p>​To this end, the committee led by the venerable Hon. Kofi Totobi Quakyi has been significantly bolstered with a new guard of legal and political heavyweights.</p>



<p>The inclusion of Hon. Rockson-Nelson Dafeamekpor, Hon. Barbara Serwaa Asamoah, Mahdi Gibrill, and Courage Kwabena Barlon creates a formidable brain trust tasked with a singular, high-stakes mission: to research, consult, and legislate internal measures that ensure leadership is won through the strength of ideas rather than the weight of a purse.</p>



<p>​This expansion is a masterstroke of political symbolism that mirrors the government’s broader aspirations for the Republic. A party that seeks to reset a nation’s economy must first prove it can reset its own soul.</p>



<p>By empowering this committee to &#8220;consult widely&#8221; and deliver &#8220;sustainable measures,&#8221; the NDC is attempting to bridge the chasm between constitutional ideals and the gritty reality of political competition.</p>



<p>It is a recognition that the credibility of a government is inextricably linked to the purity of the process that birthed its leadership.</p>



<p>​Ultimately, the Functional Executive Committee’s decision rests on the conviction that a &#8220;Reset&#8221; is only as strong as the foundation upon which it is built.</p>



<p>As the party prepares for future electoral cycles, this reconstituted body serves as both a shield against corruption and a beacon of a new political era.</p>



<p>The message is clear: the NDC is no longer content to merely talk about change; it is doing the difficult, necessary work of building a house of integrity from the inside out, ensuring that the democratic culture of the party remains a standard-bearer for the nation at large.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The New Patriotic Party (NPP) Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, Vincent Ekow Assafuah, has alleged a conflict-of-interest situation at the crisis-hit Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) involving some top management members.</p>



<p>In an extensive post on his Facebook page on Thursday, the MP alleged that the Chief Executive Officer of COCOBOD, Dr Randy Abbey, and his Acting Deputy in charge of Finance and Administration, Ato Boateng, are linked to a company, Atlas Commodities Limited, which he claims is involved in the purchase of cocoa.</p>



<p>According to the MP, a search at the Registrar-General’s Department reveals that both the Chief Executive Officer and his acting deputy are associated with Atlas Commodities. </p>



<p>He further alleges that the company has been buying cocoa using funds meant for Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs), including Produce Buying Companies (PBCs).</p>



<p>The MP published what he described as evidence of a waybill issued in the name of Atlas Commodities Limited, indicating the movement of cocoa from Kedjebi within the 2025/2026 crop season.</p>



<p>The document shared by the MP allegedly references 800 bags of Grade One cocoa, and he raised “legitimate questions” about the operational role of the private company within the cocoa purchasing chain.</p>

<p>Below is the full article by the MP:</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong>BIG SCANDAL LOOMING AT COCOBOD</strong></p>



<p>One of the reasons cocoa farmers continue to endure hardship under the current COCOBOD administration is what appears to be blatant insensitivity and possible abuse of office.</p>



<p>Serious concerns have emerged regarding the leadership of COCOBOD under Randy Abbey and his deputy, Mr Ato Boateng, Acting Deputy Chief Executive (Finance &amp; Administration), whose established professional association with Atlas Commodities Limited is confirmed by records at the Registrar-General’s Department and further corroborated by publicly available information, including a simple Google or AI search, which shows that he has been the company’s Chief Executive Officer since 2018.</p>



<p>Attached is a waybill issued in the name of Atlas Commodities Limited indicating the movement of cocoa from Kedjebi within the 2025/2026 crop season. The document references 800 bags of Grade One cocoa, raising legitimate questions about the operational role of this private company within the cocoa purchasing chain.</p>



<p>It is alleged that funds meant for Licensed Buying Companies, including PBCs, to purchase cocoa were instead redirected to this private entity, with cocoa allegedly hoarded in anticipation of future price increases.</p>



<p>These alleged activities are said to be taking place in parts of the Central and Eastern Regions, raising concerns about the scale of the operation.</p>



<p>COCOBOD is the regulator of all Licensed Buying Companies. Therefore, how can the regulator of the industry be seen to operate, directly or indirectly, as a buying company within the same system it supervises? If true, this would represent a serious conflict of interest and a breach of regulatory integrity.</p>



<p>Further claims suggest that Atlas Commodities Limited does not operate its own warehouses but may be relying on existing PBC warehouse facilities.</p>



<p>Most concerning is the allegation that Atlas Commodities may be operating within warehouses registered under PBC. COCOBOD regulations require that every warehouse be registered under a specific Licensed Buying Company. If a warehouse is registered under PBC, it should not be used for the storage, grading, sealing or processing of cocoa belonging to another company.</p>



<p>If proven, such an arrangement would constitute a serious regulatory breach and raise critical questions for the district Quality Control Officers responsible for oversight.</p>



<p>Additionally, it is being alleged that the Chief Executive has withheld a task force report related to these matters, preventing the public from knowing the full extent of its findings.</p>



<p>These are grave concerns that demand urgent and independent investigation. The matter has reportedly been brought to the attention of the Jasikan and Hohoe Police Stations.</p>



<p>Cocoa farmers deserve transparency, accountability and protection from any actions that undermine their livelihoods.</p>

<p>Residents of Atwima Behenease, a community in the Atwima Kwanwoma Municipality of Ashanti Region, are pleading with the government to intervene and rehabilitate the critically damaged &#8220;Abɔgyesɛ&#8221; River Bridge.</p>



<p>The bridge is on the edge of a disaster, coming under the strain of the recent heavy rains.</p>



<p>This has left residents worried and stranded, as transportation to access essential services has halted.</p>



<p>The bridge serves as a crucial link for surrounding communities, including Atwima Boko, Twedie, Trabuom, and Nkawie, facilitating the movement of people and goods.</p>



<p>A visit to the bridge revealed that it has been severely damaged by heavy rains, with both sides washed away, leaving only a narrow passage for vehicles and pedestrians.</p>



<p>Afia Akyaa, a resident, made an urgent plea to the government to intervene and repair the bridge, which is critical for Atwima Behenease and surrounding communities.</p>



<p>&#8220;The condition of the bridge is extremely hazardous, and we&#8217;re calling on the authorities to take immediate action, rather than waiting for disaster to strike,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Kwadwo Mensah, another resident, shed light on the appalling condition of the road, stating that it&#8217;s in a really bad shape.</p>



<p>&#8220;The entire road is in a terrible state, so if they can&#8217;t manage to fix it all, the least they could do is repair the bridge, which is a major concern for us&#8221;.</p>



<p>Kwaku Antwi, a former unit committee chairman for Akyeremade-Kwanwoma Electoral Area, stated that the bridge has been in a state of disrepair for 8 months now.</p>



<p>He said the community, led by the queen mother and elders, has reached out to the relevant authorities, including the DCE, MP, and Feeder Roads, but no action has been taken to fix the bridge.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just two weeks ago, two cars, one of which was carrying students, nearly crashed on the bridge. It was only God&#8217;s intervention that prevented the accident from happening, otherwise, we might have lost lives.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every time we approach the authorities, they assure us that plans are underway to fix the bridge, but it seems like they&#8217;re just paying lip service. It&#8217;s frustrating because it feels like they are waiting for a disaster to happen before taking real action, then they&#8217;ll probably show up with condolences and promises of help. Meanwhile, we&#8217;re the ones living with the risk every day,&#8221; he lamented.</p>

<p>Ghana’s Minister for Sports and Recreation, Kofi Adams, has pledged to donate two months of his salary to the newly established Sports Fund, following the passage of the Sports Fund Bill by the Parliament of Ghana.</p>



<p>Speaking on the floor of Parliament, Hon. Adams described the fund as a critical step toward revitalising sports development in the country and ensuring sustainable financing for athletes and federations.</p>



<p>The Minister said his decision to commit two months of his salary was a personal demonstration of support for the initiative and a call to action for other stakeholders to contribute towards the growth of sports in Ghana.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“I will donate two months of my salary to the Ghana Sports Fund.”<br><br>Hon. Kofi Adams speaking on the Sports Fund during parliamentary proceedings.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JoySports?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#JoySports</a> <a href="https://t.co/OgxjFdHjxB">pic.twitter.com/OgxjFdHjxB</a></p>&mdash; #JoySports (@JoySportsGH) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoySportsGH/status/2024515460146819556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>The Sports Fund is expected to serve as a dedicated financial vehicle to support grassroots sports, infrastructure development, athlete preparation, and the general promotion of sporting excellence nationwide.</p>



<p>The bill’s passage marks a significant policy move aimed at addressing longstanding funding challenges in the sector, with government hopeful that the fund will provide a more structured and reliable source of support for Ghanaian sports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Chamber of Oil Marketing Companies (COMAC) and the Chamber of Bulk Oil Distribution Companies (CBOD), have threatened to embark on a strike over the alleged unlawful diversion of funds from the LPG Fund to the Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing Company (GCMC).</p>



<p>In a joint statement, the two associations vowed to explore all legal means to reverse the action.</p>



<p>According to them, the move constitutes a flagrant breach of statutory mandate, a dangerous sabotage of national energy policy, and an unacceptable betrayal of public trust. They described the alleged diversion as a blatant deviation from the fund’s original purpose.</p>



<p>The associations are demanding the immediate reversal of the action through the following measures:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cease all disbursements to GCMC from the LPG Fund immediately.</li>



<li>Reverse any allocations already made to GCMC and restore the funds to their lawful purpose.</li>



<li>Reaffirm statutory mandate &#8211; Government must publicly confirm that the LPG Fund will finance only bottling plants, CRM rollout, and unsafe cylinder withdrawal.</li>



<li>Guarantee transparency &#8211; Implement quarterly public reporting on all fund utilisation with independent audit verification.</li>
</ol>



<p>They added that &#8220;These are not industry requests. These are legal and moral imperatives.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Background</strong></p>



<p>According to COMAC and CBOD, the eLPG Fund was established under Legislative Instruments LI 2262, as amended, and LI 2481, and implemented by the National Petroleum Authority, NPA, on April 1, 2024, with three explicit, legally binding objectives:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li>USD 44/MT Bottling Plant Margin &#8211; To finance construction and operation of LPG bottling plants nationwide.</li>



<li>USD 36/MT Cylinder Investment Margin &#8211; To fund the Cylinder Recirculation Model, CRM, rollout for safe and efficient LPG distribution.</li>
</ol>



<p>They argued that these purposes are non-negotiable.</p>



<p>They further noted that &#8220;the fund was never intended as discretionary capital for ad hoc allocations&#8221;.</p>



<p>The associations also maintained that &#8220;redirecting it to GCMC is not administrative flexibility it is a statutory violation that demolishes the foundation of Ghana&#8217;s LPG safety and infrastructure framework.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Government’s Intervention</strong></p>



<p>The two associations are calling on government to urgently address the matter, stating that &#8220;This moment demands decision: Will Ghana uphold the rule of law and protect its citizens, or will it condone misallocation, erode energy sector credibility, and sacrifice lives for bureaucratic convenience?&#8221;</p>



<p>They also stated that COMAC and CBOD will pursue every legitimate avenue, policy, legal, and public, to defend the LPG Fund&#8217;s rightful utilisation.</p>



<p>“We will not permit this fund to become a discretionary slush account. We will not remain passive while statutory protections are shredded,&#8221; they added.</p>



<p>They further cautioned that “we will not accept anything less than full accountability, decisive leadership, and restoration of fund integrity.&#8221;</p>



<p>“The people of Ghana deserve nothing less than protection, transparency, and respect for the law; the government must now decide which side of that equation it occupies,” they argued in the joint statement.</p>



<p>The associations also maintained that &#8220;we will explore all options to protect our interest and preserve our right as key stakeholders under the structure.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Women of Valour 2026 has been launched at the residence of the British High Commission to Ghana in Accra with policymakers, media professionals, activists and survivors in attendance.</p>



<p>The event was held on 17th February 2026 under the theme “The Pursuit of Fearlessness.”</p>



<p>At the centre of the launch were emotional testimonies from abuse survivors, whose experiences are shaping this year’s advocacy focus.</p>



<p>Musician Diana Hopeson recounted how a marriage she entered at age 21, believing shared Christian values would guarantee peace, gradually became emotionally abusive behind closed doors.</p>



<p>Despite her public image as a successful musician, she revealed that she endured repeated threats on her life.</p>



<p>“My breaking point was when he threatened to drive our car into a truck so we would both die, simply because I smiled with fans after an event,” she said.</p>



<p>She added that there were also threats to obtain a weapon and kill them both, a situation that eventually forced her to leave and seek help.</p>



<p>Actor and advocate Vicky Zugah also shared her painful experience, beginning with a relationship in 2013 that quickly turned violent.</p>



<p>“He dragged me into a room and threatened to stab me,” she recounted. “Another time, he tried to drive into a mountain with me in the car.”</p>



<p>After leaving that relationship, she entered another which she said became physically abusive even during pregnancy.</p>



<p>“He beat me and threatened to kill me and my unborn child, saying nothing would happen because we live in Ghana,” she said, adding that the most painful part was being blamed by some for the failure of her relationships.</p>



<p>Speaking at the launch, Director of the Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit, Owusuwaa Kyeremeh, assured women and young people that protection mechanisms are in place.</p>



<p>“We are ready to fight for women and the youth. No matter the status or class of the person involved, report the abuse and it will be dealt with appropriately,” she stated.</p>



<p>She noted that DOVVSU has been operational since 1998 and continues to strengthen its response systems as cases of abuse evolve.</p>



<p>Founder of Women of Valour, Nana Aba Anamoah, said the courage of survivors directly inspired this year’s theme.</p>



<p>“These are not isolated cases. Too many women suffer in silence because they are afraid afraid of judgment and afraid of not being believed,” she said.</p>



<p>According to her, “The Pursuit of Fearlessness” is about creating safe spaces where women can speak up without fear and trust that institutions will protect them.</p>



<p>The main Women of Valour 2026 event is scheduled to take place on 7 March in London, where stakeholders are expected to continue discussions on collaboration between the media, policymakers and activists to protect women and girls.</p>

<p>The Commissioner-General of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), Mr. Anthony Kwasi Sarpong, has confirmed that the interception of 17 trucks loaded with suspected smuggled cooking oil is part of intensified anti-smuggling enforcement measures to protect Ghana’s economy.</p>



<p>Describing the operation as a “decisive blow against economic sabotage”, Mr. Sarpong said on Thursday, February 19, that the intelligence-led midnight raid uncovered an alleged transit diversion scheme in which goods declared for Burkina Faso and Niger were diverted into Ghana through the Akanu corridor.</p>

<p>“This is about protecting Ghana’s economy,” Mr. Sarpong emphasised.</p>



<p>Twelve trucks have been impounded, with five reportedly still being tracked.</p>



<p>Trucks identified include:</p>

<p>Authorities say the diversion could have deprived the state of import duties, VAT, ECOWAS trade revenue, and critical protection for local edible oil producers.</p>



<p>“If you want to trade in Ghana, pay your tax. If you attempt to cheat the system, you will lose your goods and your trucks,” the Commissioner-General warned.</p>



<p>The GRA announced it will hold a national press briefing and launch deeper investigations to identify and prosecute the masterminds behind the syndicate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A woman arrested in connection with the alleged theft of a four-day-old baby boy from the Mamprobi Polyclinic remains in police custody and is expected to be put before the court in due course, the Accra Regional Police Command has confirmed.</p>



<p>In a press statement issued on Thursday, 19 February, the suspect, identified as Latifa Salifu, was apprehended on Wednesday, 18 February 2026, following what police described as intensive investigations into the reported abduction.</p>



<p>The incident was first reported to the Mamprobi District Police Command on Tuesday, 17 February 2026, after an unidentified woman, allegedly disguised as a nurse, unlawfully entered the postnatal ward of the Mamprobi Polyclinic and stole a newborn baby boy belonging to Precious Ankomah.</p>



<p>Acting on intelligence gathered, officers from the Dansoman Divisional Command tracked down and arrested Ms Salifu at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, where she was found in possession of the four-day-old child.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="771" height="1024" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-771x1024.png" alt="Mamprobi Polyclinic baby theft suspect to appear in court" class="wp-image-10032982261" title="Mamprobi Polyclinic baby theft suspect to appear in court" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-771x1024.png 771w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-226x300.png 226w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-768x1019.png 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-105x140.png 105w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-94x125.png 94w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-188x250.png 188w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-113x150.png 113w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-319x424.png 319w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907-38x50.png 38w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1907.png 1136w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px" /></figure>



<p>Preliminary investigations indicate that the suspect was unable to provide medical records or documentation to support her claim that she had delivered the baby at the hospital. She was subsequently arrested and detained to assist with ongoing enquiries.</p>



<p>The baby has since been safely reunited with his mother, Ms Ankomah, who positively identified her son through a distinctive birthmark on his left leg. The child has been referred to Korle Bu Teaching Hospital for further medical assessment and care.</p>



<p>In response to the incident, the Regional Police Command has introduced heightened security measures at the Mamprobi Polyclinic. Twenty-four-hour police protection has been deployed at the facility to ensure the safety of patients, staff and visitors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1908-768x1024.png" alt="Mamprobi Polyclinic baby theft suspect to appear in court" class="wp-image-10032982263" title="Mamprobi Polyclinic baby theft suspect to appear in court"></figure>



<p>Police emphasised that Latifa Salifu remains in custody assisting with investigations and will be put before the court in due course, as authorities work to establish the full circumstances surrounding the case.</p>



<p>“The Accra Regional Police Command cautions the general public to remain vigilant, particularly within healthcare facilities, and to promptly report any suspicious behaviour or persons to the nearest Police Station. Hospital authorities are encouraged to strictly regulate access to maternity and postnatal wards,” the statement concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Experiencing The Blend Festival firsthand has been truly remarkable. For Prudential Bank, this is what sponsorship should feel like: being part of moments that matter, celebrating diversity, and connecting with the very people and businesses we serve every day. As a Bank we provide support for the Creative sector in the form of export support. This festival is a testament to the unifying power of music, and we are proud to have powered it in partnership with Rana Motors,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Commenting, the Chief Executive Officer of Rana Motors, Essam Odaymat, who is also a member of the Blend Band expressed his surprise at the turnout saying, this is another way the vehicle manufacturing and sales company gives back to support the Creative Industry.</p>

<p>“As a company, we are dedicated to the government’s 24-hour Economy Policy. We have an assembly plant in Ghana which provides employment and production around the clock. Producing and supporting the Blend Festival is yet another way we support the Creative Arts industry by offering a platform for musicians and other players in the industry to deploy their talents, make sales and earn a living”, he said. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As the curtains fell on a spectacular night of music and connection, what lingered was a sense of community, lasting memories, strengthened relationships and renewed anticipation for future editions.&nbsp; The Blend Festival 2026 had delivered on its promise, a celebration where diversity, creativity, and commerce converged.</p>



<p>The Blend Festival was organised by Pidgen Music.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mr Davisson-Konu has shared the inspiring journey of how he reunited and married his Junior High School sweetheart, revealing that his late mother had always encouraged him to marry his first love.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview with <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0">Roselyn Felli</a> on Changes on <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1">JoyPrime</a>, Mr Davisson-Konu said their love story began in 1993 during their Junior High School days. Young, hopeful and deeply connected, they shared a bond that felt special even then. In their innocence, they promised each other that one day they would become husband and wife. However, life had other plans.</p>



<p>He explained that after completing JHS, circumstances pulled them apart. They lost contact and went on separate paths, each trying to build a future independently. Along the way, both experienced marriage but not without hardship. Mrs Davisson-Konu revealed that she lost her first husband, while Mr Konu also divorced his first wife.</p>



<p>Despite the distance, the years and the trials of life, Mr Konu said the love he once felt for Nancy still lingered in his heart. In his bid to find her, he sent a message to his old school lover on Facebook. At first, there was no response. But when she eventually replied, everything changed. Conversations resumed effortlessly, as though time had stood still. The connection was instant, genuine and deeper than before.</p>



<p>Mrs Davisson-Konu added that their reconnection made it clear that they had found in each other something rare and peaceful. Later on the show, Mr Konu said they dated for a year, rediscovering their bond and strengthening their friendship before finally deciding to get married. He added that his late mother had always advised him to marry his JHS lover, and looking back, it felt like a prophecy fulfilled.</p>



<p>They both expressed their feelings on their wedding day, saying there was no anxiety or doubt, only calm and certainty. It felt right. Their marriage has since been marked by peace, minimal conflict and strong support for one another. According to the husband, his wife sees things he often misses, proving that women possess insight that holds families together.</p>



<p>Their union, he noted, is also strengthened by how well their careers complement each other. While the husband is into event planning, the wife is a professional caterer. Interestingly, this same line of work caused challenges in the husband’s previous marriage. However, it has become a blessing in his new marriage because they walk the journey together.</p>



<p>Given the opportunity to share warm words with each other, the husband described his wife as the greatest joy of his life, promising to stand by her side through every season and circumstance. He also expressed deep gratitude for her presence and unwavering love.</p>



<p>The wife, in turn, said she knew from the very first day they reconnected that he was meant for her. She said she cherishes their late-night conversations and described him as not just her husband, but the missing piece in her life.</p>



<p>Their story, they noted, stands as a reminder that love does not always follow a straight path. Sometimes it pauses and sometimes it hides, but when it is true, it finds its way back.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The government has been commended for its commitment to boosting the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) education system in the country.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The government has been commended for its commitment to strengthening the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) sector, as the Kwadaso Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), Eric Asibey, cut sod for major infrastructure projects at the Business Secretarial and Technical Institute (BSTI) at Asuoyeboah in the Ashanti Region.</p>



<p>Principal of BSTI, Abena Mansah Foriwaah, praised the government’s sustained investment in TVET when the ceremony was held at the school.</p>



<p>The two projects include the construction of a three-storey classroom block with a two-bedroom principal’s apartment and a six-unit staff flat, awarded to Cape Tree Company Limited, as well as a multipurpose TVET centre, awarded to SG Two-Trust Company Limited.</p>



<p>The projects are expected to be completed within 24 months and 30 months, respectively, providing much-needed facilities for the institute.</p>



<p>Ms Foriwaah acknowledged the previous government’s efforts in initiating investments in technical and vocational institutions and welcomed the current administration’s commitment to sustaining and expanding those investments to boost the sector’s growth.</p>



<p>She noted that BSTI has been grappling with inadequate infrastructure and learning resources and expressed optimism that the new projects would significantly ease the situation.</p>



<p>“We were facing a lot of challenges, including a lack of teachers’ accommodation, inadequate classrooms and other infrastructure. Timely completion of this project will provide excellent teaching and learning facilities, as well as monitoring and supervision, to maintain the school’s vision of being the best in the training of engineers, secretaries and other professional personnel,” she said.</p>



<p>Ms Foriwaah added that the government has assured management that funds for the completion of the projects will be disbursed promptly, and expressed hope that the contractors would adhere to the timelines.</p>



<p>In an interview, Mr Asibey revealed that the projects are being funded by the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETFund) under the New Targeted and Emergency Projects (NTEmP) initiative. He said the projects form part of efforts to improve educational infrastructure and enhance the learning environment in the municipality.</p>



<p>He expressed gratitude to President John Dramani Mahama for driving development across the country and underscored the importance of quality education in shaping Ghana’s future generations.</p>



<p>The MCE urged the contractors to adhere strictly to project specifications and timelines, noting that funding has already been secured.</p>



<p>“President Mahama is committed to completing all the projects initiated by the previous government, and, for that matter, he cannot abandon his own projects. So, the consultant needs to keep an eye on the contractors and ensure that top-notch materials are being used and that deadlines are met,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Asibey also stressed the need to engage local skilled labour to create employment opportunities for young people in the municipality.</p>



<p>“We want to see the involvement of our local people — masons, carpenters and other artisans — in this project, and we appeal to the contractor to prioritise the use of local resources,” he added.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Engineer Richard Addo-Gyamfi, Ashanti Regional Director of the Ghana Technical and Vocational Education and Training Service (GTVET), raised concerns about encroachment on the school’s land due to the absence of infrastructure and a boundary wall.</p>



<p>He made an urgent appeal to the relevant authorities and stakeholders to intervene and prevent further encroachments to safeguard the future of the institute.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Security expert Ishmael Norman has described recent comments by former Defence Minister Dominic Nitiwul as unfair and has called on him to apologise.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on JoyNews’ The Pulse, Dr Norman argued that Mr Nitiwul’s assertion that the absence of a substantive Defence Minister has left Ghana vulnerable was overly broad and disparaging to the country’s security institutions.</p>



<p>His remarks follow Mr Nitiwul’s sharp criticism of President John Dramani Mahama over the prolonged vacancy at the Ministry of Defence. The former minister had warned that Ghana’s security architecture was being exposed amid rising regional threats, particularly after the killing of eight Ghanaian traders in Burkina Faso.</p>



<p>“It is not very fair for Honourable Dominic Nitiwul to say that the absence of a substantive Defence Minister has rendered Ghana weak. That is a bit insulting to all the major generals, brigadier generals, colonels, the Chief of Defence Staff, all the way down the military hierarchy,” Dr Norman said.</p>



<p>“One civilian with no military experience who becomes Minister of Defence is not going to micro-manage the generals in the military,” he added. “His statement is too broad, too raw, and it alienates those working to keep Ghana safe.”</p>



<p>He further noted that countries without standing armies often maintain strong security systems through well-trained police, immigration and customs services, stressing that national security is not solely dependent on the military.</p>



<p>Dr Norman maintained that although he holds Mr Nitiwul in high regard, the comments were biased and partisan.</p>



<p>“I believe he should really apologise for that statement,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Member of Parliament for Ayawaso West Wuogon, John Dumelo, has announced plans to provide free Ghana-made cocoa drinks to public basic school pupils in his constituency.</p>



<p>In a statement, the MP said the initiative will start on March 2 and will benefit pupils from Class One to Class Four.</p>



<p>According to him, the programme aims to support the nutritional needs of schoolchildren while promoting locally made products.</p>



<p>“From 2nd March 2026, I will be providing free Ghana-made cocoa drinks to all public basic pupils from Class 1 to 4 in my beloved Ayawaso West Constituency,” he stated.</p>



<p>He added that the initiative has multiple benefits: boosting local industry by sourcing exclusively Ghana-made products to support cocoa farmers and local manufacturers, enhancing school attendance by providing nutritious incentives, and fostering national pride by helping children appreciate Ghana’s cocoa heritage.</p>



<p>“This programme is a testament to our belief that a healthy child is a teachable child,” the statement concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mfantsipim Senior High School has outlined a five-pillar reform agenda to strengthen academic, infrastructure and national education impact as the school prepares to mark its sesquicentennial.</p>



<p>Addressing a pre-launch press briefing in Accra yesterday, the Chairman of the 150th Anniversary Planning Committee, John B. Yamoah, said the anniversary would go beyond ceremonial observance and serve as a strategic platform to consolidate the institution’s legacy while repositioning it for the future.</p>



<p>“For a century and a half, Mfantsipim has shaped generations of leaders &#8211; statesmen, professionals, academics, clergy, sportsmen, and innovators-men who have served the nation and the world with distinction.</p>



<p>“This Sesquicentennial is, therefore, more than a school anniversary-it is a national celebration of 150 years of secondary education in Ghana,” he added.</p>



<p>Founded in 1876 by the Methodist Church Ghana, Mfantsipim is widely regarded as the cradle of formal secondary education in the country.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Focus</h2>



<p>The anniversary, on the theme: “A legacy of excellence, leadership and service to inspire the future,” will be anchored on five strategic pillars.</p>



<p>They are &#8211; celebrating the school’s heritage, strengthening academic delivery, improving infrastructure, deepening alumni and community engagement, and contributing meaningfully to national education development.</p>



<p>The committee, which was inaugurated in August 2024, had constituted sub-committees to drive implementation of the programmes in collaboration with stakeholders.</p>



<p>They include the Methodist Church Ghana, the Ministry of Education and the Mfantsipim Old Boys Association (MOBA).</p>



<p>Mr Yamoah mentioned key legacy projects earmarked under the reform agenda to include the upgrading of academic and residential facilities, expansion of STEM and digital learning infrastructure, enhancement of sports facilities, the establishment of a historical museum to preserve the school’s archives, and the erection of a 150th anniversary monument.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Activities</h2>



<p>The anniversary year, which will run until December 2026, will feature significant events which would include an official launch scheduled for April 11, 2026, in Accra, followed by a series of educational, cultural and community engagements across the country.</p>



<p>“The success of Mfantsipim@150 depends on all of us; MOBA, staff of Mfantsipim, students, parents, the Methodist Church Ghana, corporate partners, traditional authorities, and the people of Cape Coast and of Ghana.</p>



<p>“Together, let us honour the past, celebrate the present, and secure the future of this great institution by investing in it,” Mr Yamoah said.</p>



<p>He warned that any unauthorised reproduction or commercial exploitation of the trademarked logo or memorabilia would attract legal sanctions.</p>



<p>A representative of the Methodist Church, Rt Rev. Emmanuel Borlabi Bortey, said mission schools were established not merely for literacy but for moral and spiritual transformation.</p>



<p>He said that education was central to spreading the Gospel and building integrity-driven societies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Significance</h2>



<p>The Director-General of the Ghana Education Service, Professor Ernest Kofi Davis, described the anniversary as a platform to assess and advance secondary education nationally.</p>



<p>Using Mfantsipim as a benchmark, he said GES would strengthen STEM, digital learning, teacher development and access to quality education, and ensure that such standards were replicated across the country to meet 21st-century demands.</p>



<p>For his part, the Headmaster of the school, Very Rev. Ebenezer K. Aidoo, described the anniversary as a celebration, a call to action, and an investment in the future.</p>



<p>He urged alumni to mobilise resources, strengthen networks and influence to strengthen infrastructure, digital learning and holistic education, among other initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana’s second group game at the World Cup against England could be cancelled due to an escalating funding dispute surrounding the stadium scheduled to host the match.</p>



<p>FIFA is facing the alarming prospect of relocating seven matches away from Gillette Stadium, barely four months before the tournament begins per UK newspaper, The Mirror.</p>



<p>The venue which serves as home to the New England Patriots and New England Revolution is slated to host several World Cup fixtures, including the Ghana vs England encounter.</p>



<p>Scotland’s first two World Cup matches against Haiti and Morocco, are also scheduled to be played there, as well as Norway’s clash with France and a fixture involving one of Bolivia, Iraq or Suriname. The stadium is additionally due to host a Round of 32 match and a quarter-final.</p>



<p>However, the town of Foxborough is threatening not to grant the necessary entertainment licence unless its security costs are guaranteed in advance.</p>



<p>Although the stadium forms part of the Boston metropolitan area, approximately 22 miles south-west of the city, FIFA’s sponsorship regulations mean it will be officially referred to as “Boston Stadium” during the tournament.</p>



<p>The dispute came into sharp focus during a town meeting on Tuesday night between members of the Foxborough Select Board and FIFA representatives.</p>



<p>Director of venue operations Kevin Clark and Boston 2026 host committee president Mike Loynd were questioned by board members.</p>



<p>Board chair Bill Yukna asked Loynd:<br>“Is FIFA, who is going to be the licensee, are they in the end responsible if nothing else comes through on this?”</p>



<p>Loynd replied: &#8220;That&#8217;s sort of a broad question.”</p>



<p>Board member Mark Elfman responded: “It&#8217;s really not.”</p>



<p>Elfman added as quoted by the Mirror: “I gotta be honest with you, it baffles my mind that you guys are sitting here in front of me right now and how we still have no idea where this money&#8217;s coming from.”</p>



<p>At the centre of the disagreement is an estimated $7.8 million in security funding.</p>



<p>Foxborough officials insist the amount must be guaranteed upfront, making it clear they will not risk taxpayers’ money on the promise of reimbursement.</p>



<p>Vice chair Stephanie McGowan stated firmly:<br>“We&#8217;re not prepared to issue this license unless everything is in place. I&#8217;m gonna tell you, this board will not issue this license.”</p>



<p>She further questioned: &#8220;How does anybody expect that we would do this for someone who&#8217;s coming into our town for 39 days, making all these demands, and then you guys are gonna go away. Then once there is no Boston26 … well, who are we gonna sue?”</p>



<p>Despite the hardline position, Yukna indicated that a resolution remains possible.</p>



<p>&#8220;We want nothing more than to be able to just sign on the dotted line and know that when the events start, our problems aren&#8217;t about the money.”</p>



<p>Ghana is Group L and will play England on June 23, 2026, in Boston.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Government has released GH¢855 million to settle arrears owed to cocoa farmers after a prolonged payment crisis that left many producers unpaid for months, despite delivering their produce to licensed buying companies.</p>



<p>The payment is part of an emergency intervention to stabilise the cocoa sector and restore confidence among farmers and buying companies. </p>



<p>In the wake of the crisis, the government has also announced a broad package of reforms aimed at restructuring the industry and putting the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) on a more sustainable financial footing. </p>



<p>These reforms include a controversial reduction of more than GH¢1,000 in the producer price per bag, a move that has sparked debate across the sector.</p>



<p>Speaking to journalists in Parliament of Ghana, Chairman of the Finance Committee, Isaac Adongo, defended the measures, describing them as difficult but necessary steps to rescue a sector he said has been under severe financial strain for years.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ADONGO-855.mp3.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>“The bottom line of all that has happened is that some amounts were owed to cocoa farmers, and the government took a decision to repay those monies so that the cocoa buying companies can settle the outstanding obligations,” he said.</p>



<p>“I’m happy to report that this morning, the government has released 855 million cedis for that purpose. But we have also decided to introduce a number of reforms that are long overdue. </p>



<p>&#8220;The cocoa sector has been under enormous strain over the years, and we have been pretending to service cocoa farmers while destroying the very vehicle we use to support them.”</p>



<p>Mr Adongo also blamed the crisis on the previous New Patriotic Party (NPP) administration, rejecting claims that responsibility lies with the current government. </p>



<p>According to him, COCOBOD entered 2025 heavily indebted and financially distressed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ADONGO-RECKLESS.mp3.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>“COCOBOD entered 2025 with about GH¢17.8 billion in loans, plus significant operational liabilities. When you add everything together, the exposure was over GH¢60 billion. That vehicle could not be sustainable and had to be addressed,” he said.</p>



<p>“You have 60 billion of somebody’s money, it’s not free money. You are not paying, and yet you are saying we should continue to go and borrow more.”</p>



<p>He maintained that the release of funds to farmers, coupled with structural reforms in pricing, financing and operations, is intended to stabilise the sector, protect farmers in the long term, and rebuild COCOBOD into a financially viable institution capable of sustaining Ghana’s cocoa economy.</p>

<p>Former Defence Minister and Bimbilla Member of Parliament Dominic Nitiwul has called on the government to provide a full explanation regarding recent developments affecting Ghanaian nationals abroad, emphasising the urgent need for a fully empowered Defence Minister to oversee investigations.</p>



<p>Mr Nitiwul’s comments come in the wake of a recent terrorist attack in Burkina Faso that targeted Ghanaian tomato traders, raising concerns about the safety of Ghanaian nationals operating in volatile regions of West Africa.</p>



<p>Eight Ghanaians were killed, and several others were injured in the deadly attack.</p>



<p>Speaking to the press, Mr Nitiwul expressed concern over what he described as insufficient information from government authorities. </p>



<p>“I just think that the Ghanaian government must be explaining to us what happened, the circumstances. I think the government has not yet come out,” he said. “They’ve come out officially with some statement, but we want a detailed explanation, either by the foreign minister or by the defence minister.&#8221;</p>



<p>He further stressed the importance of having a defence minister in place to coordinate Ghana’s response in times of crisis.</p>

<li><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href="http://Ghanaian tomato traders targeted in deadly terrorist attack – Association President speaks">Ghanaian tomato traders targeted in deadly terrorist attack – Association President speaks</a></li>
</ul>



<p>“And that’s why I kept on calling that the President should have appointed a Defence Minister, because by this time the Minister for Defence should have been on the flight to Burkina Faso with his team,” Mr Nitiwul said.</p>



<p>The former minister highlighted that a defence minister with a full mandate is critical not only for leading investigations but also for ensuring timely government action and coordination with security agencies abroad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman of Parliament’s Finance Committee, Isaac Adongo, has announced that the Ministry of Roads and Highways will take over road construction projects previously managed by the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), citing mismanagement and unsustainable financial commitments.</p>



<p>Addressing a press briefing on the cocoa sector and related infrastructure challenges, the Bolgatanga Central MP disclosed that COCOBOD entered 2025 with more than GH¢26.5 billion in outstanding road commitments. Of this amount, only GH¢4.4 billion has been certified, rationalised and transferred to the Roads Ministry for implementation.</p>



<p>He stressed that road construction falls outside COCOBOD’s core mandate, particularly at a time when the board is facing significant financial strain.</p>



<p>“It is time for us to wash our hands off cocoa roads and get the appropriate ministry — the Ministry of Roads and Highways — to take over the construction of roads,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Adongo further revealed that between 2017 and 2020, COCOBOD undertook road projects without board approval. He said contracts worth GH¢1.4 billion were awarded in 2017, GH¢14 billion in 2018–2019, and GH¢5.8 billion during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite no allocations being approved for such works.</p>



<p>“The end result is that we are now saddled with about GH¢26.6 billion in road commitments at COCOBOD. Certainly, this cannot continue,” he stated.</p>



<p>He also raised concerns about the management of loans from the African Development Bank. According to him, COCOBOD accessed a GH¢600 million facility, of which GH¢250 million was not released by the bank. He added that the remaining GH¢350 million, intended to boost cocoa production, failed to achieve its objective, as cocoa output declined.</p>



<p>Mr Adongo maintained that transferring the road projects to the Roads Ministry would rationalise spending and allow COCOBOD to concentrate on its core responsibility of improving cocoa production.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, Vincent Ekow Assafuah, has petitioned the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) to investigate what he describes as serious concerns of conflict of interest, abuse of office, and administrative malpractice at the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD)]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, Vincent Ekow Assafuah, has petitioned the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) to investigate what he describes as serious concerns of conflict of interest, abuse of office, and administrative malpractice at the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD)</p>



<p>A formal petition was submitted to the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) today, Thursday, February 19, calling for a full-scale investigation into the issues.</p>



<p>The petition, grounded in Article 218(a) of the 1992 Constitution and Section 7(1)(a) of the CHRAJ Act, 1993 (Act 456), raises concerns about the conduct of Mr. Ato Boateng, Acting Deputy Chief Executive in charge of Finance and Administration at COCOBOD.</p>



<p><strong>Alleged Prior Ties to Private Company</strong></p>



<p>According to the petitioner, publicly available records and professional profiles indicate that Mr. Boateng previously served as Chief Executive Officer of Atlas Commodities Limited in 2018. The company is engaged in cocoa-related commercial activities.</p>



<p>The petitioner argues that this prior executive and fiduciary relationship raises red flags, particularly given Mr. Boateng’s current strategic role at COCOBOD, where he is said to wield significant influence over financial approvals, administrative control, regulatory oversight and institutional decision-making affecting Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs) and other cocoa sector operators.</p>



<p><strong>Warehouse Operations Under Scrutiny</strong></p>



<p>A key issue highlighted in the petition concerns the operations of Atlas Commodities Limited within warehouses registered under the Produce Buying Company (PBC).</p>



<p>Under COCOBOD regulations, warehouses are required to be registered under and used exclusively by specific Licensed Buying Companies. Such facilities are not to be used for the storage, grading, sealing or processing of cocoa belonging to other companies.</p>



<p>The petition contends that Atlas Commodities’ operations within PBC-registered warehouses raise serious regulatory and governance concerns, especially in light of Mr. Boateng’s previous leadership role at the company and his current senior management position at COCOBOD.</p>



<p><strong>Constitutional and Legal Basis</strong></p>



<p>The petitioner cites Article 284 of the 1992 Constitution, which states that a public officer must not place himself in a position where his personal interest conflicts or is likely to conflict with the performance of his official duties.</p>



<p>The petition also references the Public Office Holders (Declaration of Assets and Disqualification) Act, 1998 (Act 550), which prohibits public officers from engaging in conduct that creates a conflict between private interests and official responsibilities.</p>



<p>Additionally, Section 7(1)(a) of the CHRAJ Act empowers the Commission to investigate alleged corruption, abuse of power, unfair treatment and administrative injustice involving public officers.</p>



<p><strong>Key Issues for Investigation</strong></p>



<p>The petitioner is urging CHRAJ to investigate:</p>



<p>-Whether Mr. Boateng’s prior executive role at Atlas Commodities constitutes a conflict of interest under Article 284 of the Constitution.</p>



<p>-Whether full disclosure of his past association with the company was made to COCOBOD and relevant state oversight bodies upon his appointment.</p>



<p>-Whether Atlas Commodities has received any preferential treatment, regulatory accommodation or operational advantage within COCOBOD-regulated systems.</p>



<p>-Whether the use of PBC-registered warehouses by the company violates COCOBOD regulations and whether any official facilitation enabled such operations.</p>



<p>-Whether the circumstances amount to abuse of office, regulatory capture or administrative malpractice.</p>



<p><strong>Reliefs Being Sought</strong></p>



<p>The petition is requesting CHRAJ to conduct a full, independent and transparent investigation into the allegations; determine whether any constitutional, statutory or administrative breaches have occurred; and recommend appropriate sanctions or institutional reforms where necessary.</p>



<p>It further calls for corrective administrative measures to safeguard the integrity of COCOBOD’s regulatory and operational systems.</p>



<p>Describing the cocoa industry as one of Ghana’s most strategic economic pillars, the petitioner stresses that the integrity and impartiality of COCOBOD’s governance structures are of paramount national importance.</p>



<p>The petition concludes that any situation that reasonably gives rise to conflict-of-interest concerns must be addressed decisively to preserve public trust, institutional credibility and regulatory fairness.</p>



<p>CHRAJ is yet to publicly comment on the petition.</p>

<p>The Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) has intercepted 12 articulated trucks in a major enforcement operation along the Dawhenya–Tema Road, in what officials describe as a serious breach of Ghana’s transit regime with significant revenue implications.</p>



<p>The operation, conducted between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m., was led by the Deputy Commissioner, Operations, with support from the Chief Revenue Officer, Preventive (Tema Collection), the Revenue Mobilisation Taskforce of National Security, and enforcement officers from both the Tema Collection and Customs Headquarters.</p>



<p>The 12 trucks are believed to be part of a consignment of 18 articulated trucks that had been electronically gated out of the Customs system as transit goods.</p>



<p>They were declared as goods in transit from Akanu, destined for Niger through Kulungugu. However, the trucks were intercepted while moving without the mandatory Customs human escort, a major breach of transit procedures.</p>



<p>The trucks were loaded with 44,055 packages of edible cooking oil, tomato paste and spaghetti. Authorities say the actual value of taxes involved is over GH¢85 million.</p>



<p>Eleven of the intercepted trucks have been moved to the GPHA Transit Terminal and are under strict Customs supervision, with logistical support from the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority.</p>

<p>One truck developed a mechanical fault during the operation, and its contents are being transferred to another vehicle to secure the goods.</p>



<p>Preliminary checks confirm that all 18 trucks were electronically gated out of the system, yet only 12 have been physically secured.</p>



<p>Investigations are ongoing to identify and track the six outstanding trucks.</p>



<p>Deputy Minister for Finance, Thomas Nyarko Ampem, congratulated the team for the bust and explained that explained that “Investigation is ongoing to identify the six outstanding trucks.”</p>



<p>He disclosed that he has directed the Commissioner-General to conclude investigations within one week.</p>



<p>“I’ve asked the Commissioner-General to conclude investigations in one week. We are tracking the two Customs officers who were involved,” he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Ampem stressed the seriousness of the matter, noting that the potential revenue loss is substantial.</p>



<p>“We take these things seriously because the impact on our revenue is serious,” he added.</p>



<p>On his part, the Commissioner-General of the Ghana Revenue Authority, Anthony Kwasi Sarpong, cautioned businesses and traders to comply fully with Customs laws.</p>



<p>He warned that authorities would not hesitate to apply the full rigours of the law against offenders.</p>



<p>“We will apply the law of confiscation. The full arms of the law will be applied,” he said, adding that the GRA would crack the whip on any business or individual found culpable of actions that deny the state much-needed revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Chamber of Oil Marketing Companies (COMAC) and the Chamber of Bulk Oil Distributors (CBOD) have condemned the alleged diversion of funds from the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Fund to the Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing Company (GCMC), describing the move as a “flagrant breach of statutory mandate” and a “dangerous sabotage of national energy policy.”</p>



<p>The LPG Fund, implemented by the National Petroleum Authority (NPA) on April 1, 2024, under Legislative Instruments LI 2262 (amended) and LI 2481, was established with three legally binding objectives:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>USD 44/MT Bottling Plant Margin</strong> – To finance the construction and operation of LPG bottling plants nationwide.</li>



<li><strong>USD 36/MT Cylinder Investment Margin</strong> – To fund the Cylinder Recirculation Model (CRM) for safe and efficient LPG distribution.</li>
</ol>



<p>The press release emphasised that the fund’s purposes are non-negotiable and were never intended as discretionary capital for ad hoc allocations. </p>



<p>Redirecting resources to GCMC, according to COMAC and CBOD, represents not administrative flexibility but a direct breach of law that undermines the LPG safety and infrastructure framework.</p>



<p>The chambers argued that diverting the fund away from bottling plant development, CRM rollout, and the withdrawal of unsafe cylinders endangers lives. </p>



<p>“Government is actively choosing GCMC’s financial convenience over the holistic mission to increase LPG accessibility, remove lethal cylinders from circulation, and ensure safe replacement,” the statement read.</p>



<div data-wp-interactive="core/file" class="wp-block-file"><object data-wp-bind--hidden="!state.hasPdfPreview" hidden class="wp-block-file__embed" data="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PRESS-RELEASE-1.pdf" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%;height:600px" aria-label="Embed of PRESS RELEASE (1)."></object><a id="wp-block-file--media-34221074-479f-4dc5-a676-1c9b3d3ddb69" href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PRESS-RELEASE-1.pdf">PRESS RELEASE (1)</a><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PRESS-RELEASE-1.pdf" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-34221074-479f-4dc5-a676-1c9b3d3ddb69" download>Download</a></div>



<p>Beyond the immediate energy sector, the alleged diversion carries wider economic consequences:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Destruction of private investment</strong> – Operators who invested billions based on statutory assurances face potential collapse.</li>



<li><strong>Job losses</strong> – Thousands of livelihoods along the LPG value chain are threatened.</li>



<li><strong>Consumer exploitation</strong> – Households may bear the burden through higher prices, reduced supply, and continued safety risks.</li>



<li><strong>Investor flight</strong> – Both domestic and foreign investors may withdraw from a jurisdiction where statutory guarantees are not respected.</li>
</ul>



<p>The chambers warned that “every diverted cedi erodes competitiveness, freezes critical investment, and transfers wealth from productive enterprise to governmental discretion,” undermining public confidence in state institutions.</p>



<p>COMAC and CBOD outlined clear, non-negotiable corrective measures:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cease all disbursements</strong> to GCMC from the LPG Fund immediately.</li>



<li><strong>Reverse any allocations</strong> already made and restore funds to their lawful purpose.</li>



<li><strong>Reaffirm statutory mandate</strong> – Ensure the fund finances only bottling plants, CRM rollout, and unsafe cylinder withdrawal.</li>



<li><strong>Guarantee transparency</strong> – Implement quarterly public reporting on all fund utilisation with independent audit verification.</li>
</ol>



<p>“These are not industry requests. These are legal and moral imperatives,” the statement stressed.</p>



<p>The chambers a pointed message to authorities: the government must now decide whether to uphold the rule of law, protect its citizens, and maintain energy sector credibility, or to condone misallocation and bureaucratic convenience at the expense of safety and public trust.</p>



<p>COMAC and CBOD pledged to pursue all legitimate avenues—policy, legal, and public—to defend the LPG Fund’s rightful utilisation. </p>



<p>“We will not permit this fund to become a discretionary slush account. We will not remain passive while statutory protections are shredded. We will not accept anything less than full accountability, decisive leadership, and restoration of fund integrity,” the statement concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman of the Finance Committee of Parliament, Isaac Adongo, has disclosed that the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) began 2025 burdened with approximately GH¢17.8 billion in loans and additional operational liabilities, warning that the institution was facing severe financial distress.</p>



<p>Addressing a press briefing on the current cocoa sector crisis, the Bolgatanga Central MP said the scale of COCOBOD’s debt exposure had become unsustainable and required urgent intervention.</p>



<p>“COCOBOD entered 2025 with roughly GH¢17.8 billion in loans plus operational liabilities. So loans alone were about GH¢17.8 billion by the beginning of 2025.</p>



<p>“If you add this to other obligations, you will soon come to realise that at this point, COCOBOD was bleeding with an exposure of about GH¢60 billion,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Adongo argued that the situation made continued borrowing imprudent, stressing that the cocoa sector could not remain viable under such heavy debt.</p>



<p>“Certainly, that vehicle could not be sustainable and needed to be addressed,” he noted.</p>



<p>To illustrate his point, the MP used a metaphor, questioning the logic of accumulating more debt without fixing underlying inefficiencies.</p>



<p>“If you have a basket in which you put water to drink and the bucket is leaking, do you fix the leak before you put water inside, or do you continue to put the water inside hoping that some will be left for you to drink?” he asked.</p>



<p>Adongo criticised those he said were advising government to take on additional borrowing despite the existing liabilities, describing such arguments as &#8220;illogical&#8221;.</p>



<p>“You have GH¢60 billion of somebody’s money. It’s not free money. You are not paying, and you are saying that we should continue even to go and borrow more,” he said.</p>



<p>He maintained that the cocoa sector requires a reset, insisting that government must confront the financial realities rather than deepen COCOBOD’s debt burden.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Police in South Africa have detained the youngest son of Zimbabwe&#8217;s late former President Robert Mugabe after a reported shooting at a property in an upmarket suburb in Johannesburg.</p>



<p>Bellarmine Mugabe, thought to be in his late 20s, was taken into custody following allegations that a 23-year-old man, believed to be a gardener, was shot.</p>



<p>Police are currently at the house in Hyde Park, where Mugabe was staying, and are searching for a firearm in what they are describing as a case of attempted murder.</p>



<p>Bellarmine Mugabe is the youngest son of Robert and his second wife Grace Mugabe. Robert Mugabe, who died in 2019, led Zimbabwe for 37 years before being forced out of power at the age of 93 in 2017.</p>



<p>Two people have been detained for questioning as the South African police determine the circumstances of the shooting, police spokesperson Col Dimakatso Nevhuhulwi told the BBC.</p>



<p>Police are not yet officially naming Bellarmine Mugabe as one of those being held, but reporters at the scene saw him in handcuffs and he has been widely named by local media.</p>



<p>The victim is in hospital and in a critical condition, the spokesperson added.</p>

<p>The government has announced plans to rename the National Investigations Bureau (NIB) as the Bureau of National Intelligence (BNI) as part of proposed reforms contained in the Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025.</p>



<p>The Interior Minister, Mohammed Mubarak Muntaka, told Parliament on Thursday, 19 January, that the change is intended to eliminate persistent confusion surrounding the NIB acronym, which is frequently mistaken for the National Investment Bank.</p>



<p>Addressing Members of Parliament on the floor of the House, the Minister argued that the overlap undermines clarity within the country’s security framework and runs counter to global practice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Everywhere in the world, you make sure that the acronyms for the security agencies do not match anything else, and in fact, it is supported by law to make sure that nobody can name anything after an acronym of any of the security agencies,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, we have a situation where, when you say NIB, people are wondering whether you&#8217;re talking about the bank or you&#8217;re talking about the security agency. So Mister Speaker, one of the significant things that we are trying to do is to reintroduce the name BNI at this time. Even though the BNI of yesterday was the Bureau of National Investigation, this BNI will remain the Bureau of National Intelligence.&#8221;</p>



<p>The proposed rebranding forms part of broader institutional adjustments aimed at restructuring Ghana’s security architecture. Beyond the name change, the bill also seeks to abolish the specific portfolio of the Minister for National Security.</p>



<p>Under the new arrangement, the President would be empowered to designate a Minister to exercise oversight over the National Security Coordinator, rather than maintaining a standalone ministry.</p>



<p>Explaining the rationale, Mr Muntaka said the reforms are designed to prevent operational friction and role duplication within the security establishment.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;A detailed ministerial role and the function of the national security coordinator, because he&#8217;s supposed to coordinate all the activities within the space. And if you assign or leave a ministry called the Ministry of National Security, which is likely supposed to play an oversight role, and if you are not careful, they begin to conflate, and they begin to have misunderstandings, and that affects the security architecture that we have in the country.</p>



<p>&#8220;So one of the things that we are trying to do is to keep this position as more or less that of the President, and then he gets one of his ministers to play that oversight without the necessarily fine, detailed designation of a minister for national security, so that as much as possible you try to avoid the conflict between the minister and the National Security coordinator&#8221;.</p>



<p>However, the Minority Leader, Alexander Afenyo-Markin, has mounted strong opposition to the Bill, cautioning that it risks concentrating excessive authority in the hands of the National Security Coordinator.</p>



<p>He questioned the necessity of the reforms, arguing that the memorandum accompanying the Bill fails to demonstrate shortcomings in the existing legal framework.</p>



<p>He said, &#8220;The memorandum before us does not provide any empirical evidence to suggest that ACT 1030 has failed. It appears that this bill is more founded on partisan political interest than a national security interest for good governance.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is being proposed? So much power is being given to the coordinator; it is not clear how his powers are going to be fettered, Mr Speaker. My submission is that if you give such powers to the coordinator, and you do not provide for a clear path of responsibility, accountability, and oversight, it becomes problematic to you yourself as a government, and when the rights of citizens are being abused, the man will come and tell you that in the name of national security. There will be the need for the Minister to sit with us as a house, do further winnowing, and incorporate the major concerns raised by the minority on this floor.&#8221;</p>



<p>The debate signals the likelihood of intense scrutiny as Parliament considers the Bill, with questions centering on accountability, oversight, and the balance of power within the national security framework.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ghana Tertiary Education Council (GTEC) has ordered the immediate closure of Royal Nursing College in Tafo Nyhiaeso, Ashanti Region, citing the institution’s failure to provide documentation verifying its accreditation.</p>



<p>GTEC stated that the college does not hold accreditation from the Nursing and Midwifery Council and had ignored a previous directive issued in June 2024, which prohibited the admission of new students.</p>



<p>The college, reportedly enrolling over 800 students, has been operating without proper registration, raising serious concerns about programme management and the quality of education being offered.</p>



<p>According to Accra-based Citi News, GTEC officials visited the campus on Thursday, February 19, and after an inspection lasting about an hour, announced the closure.</p>



<p>The Council emphasized that the measure was necessary to protect students and enforce national education standards.</p>



<p>Plans are being made to transfer affected students to accredited institutions, with special arrangements expected for final-year students to complete their programmes.</p>



<p>The closure left many students distraught, with some reportedly in tears on campus. Several expressed frustration, noting that they had recently paid tuition fees only to face an abrupt disruption to their studies.</p>



<p>During the enforcement visit, the Criminal Investigation Department accompanied GTEC officials, taking into custody the wife of the school’s owner and certain members of the college’s management team.</p>
