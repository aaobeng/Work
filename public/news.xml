										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As Ghana navigates a tense political and security climate, this week’s edition of Newsfile on <strong>JoyNews</strong>, hosted by Samson Lardy Anyenini, is set to confront four major national and international issues that strike at the heart of governance, justice, and state responsibility.</p>



<p>At the top of the agenda is the reported killing of eight Ghanaian citizens in a terrorist attack in neighbouring Burkina Faso which has raised concerns about regional insecurity, border protection, and the state’s responsibility to safeguard its citizens abroad.</p>



<p>On the back of this development, there has been calls for President John Mahama to appoint a substantive Defence Minister. Are the calls valid or just politics?</p>



<p>The programme is expected to interrogate whether the Ghanaian state did enough to protect its nationals, particularly traders and migrants who operate within high-risk zones.</p>



<p>Attention then moves from regional security concerns to a troubling case involving a Russian national accused of sexual exploitation, with explicit footage reportedly circulating online.</p>



<p>Beyond determining criminal responsibility, the central issue is whether justice will ultimately be served, especially as the government weighs the possibility of extradition.</p>



<p>With international elements at play, questions arise about the strength and efficiency of Ghana’s extradition processes. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, governance and accountability return to the forefront with developments surrounding former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta. Reports that he has been taken off an INTERPOL Red Notice have stirred debate about the strength and direction of ongoing investigations connected to his tenure in office.</p>



<p>A Red Notice is a global request to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending legal action. Its removal raises pressing questions: Was the notice procedurally flawed? Does this weaken the case? Or does it reflect a legal recalibration rather than an exoneration? The matter intersects with Ghana’s anti-corruption drive, due process rights, and the perception of whether international policing tools are being used appropriately in politically sensitive cases.</p>



<p>Rounding out the discussion is the Chief Justice’s dismissal of petitions challenging the removal processes involving the heads of the Electoral Commission and the Office of the Special Prosecutor, on the grounds that no prima facie case had been established.</p>



<p>Join <strong>JoyNews&#8217; </strong>Samson Lardy Anyenini and the experts as they delve into the national issues.</p>



<p>Newsfile airs live on the JoyNews channel on digital satellite channels 421 on DSTV and 144 on GoTV, and streams on JoyNews’ Facebook or YouTube channels on Saturdays from 9 am to noon.</p>



<p>Viewers can also follow the discussion by tuning in to Joy 99.7 FM or Luv 99.5 FM on the radio or stream the discussion live on either Google or Apple Podcasts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana Link Network Services Limited, operators of the Integrated Customs Management System (ICUMS), says all 18 transit trucks captured under Bill of Entry (BOE) 80226125039 have been accounted for on its electronic tracking platform.</p>



<p>In a statement issued on Friday, 20 February, the company clarified that the six trucks earlier reported as missing were fully traceable on its electronic tracking system.</p>



<p>The clarification follows reports that the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) had stepped up efforts to trace six articulated trucks suspected to be unaccounted for in an alleged transit diversion scheme involving goods with potential tax exposure exceeding GH¢85 million.</p>



<p>The trucks formed part of a consignment of 18 vehicles electronically gated out of the Customs system as transit cargo but were allegedly found moving within Ghana without the mandatory Customs escort.</p>



<p>Twelve of the trucks were intercepted during a late-night enforcement operation along the Dawhenya–Tema Road, while six were reported yet to be located.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="604" height="638" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1998.png" alt="Ghana Link dismisses ‘missing’ transit truck claims" class="wp-image-10032983399" title="Ghana Link dismisses ‘missing’ transit truck claims" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1998.png 604w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1998-284x300.png 284w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1998-133x140.png 133w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1998-118x125.png 118w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1998-237x250.png 237w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1998-142x150.png 142w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1998-401x424.png 401w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1998-47x50.png 47w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></figure>



<p>However, Ghana Link said its electronic tracking data, playback analysis, and physical verification exercises confirm that all the trucks have been located.</p>



<p>“As of yesterday and this morning, Ghana Link’s field team physically confirmed their locations as seen on our tracking system. We have transmitted the information and report to the Customs Division for any action deemed necessary under the law,” the statement said.</p>



<p>According to the company, playback data showed that the trucks initially travelled along the declared transit route from Akanu to Kulungugu until authorities directed 11 of them to proceed to the Tema Customs transit yard.</p>



<p>“This should be understood as an enforcement-led diversion for control purposes, not evidence that the trucks had disappeared,” the statement clarified.</p>



<p>Ghana Link said two of the trucks were located at Aflao, another two at the Aflao–Accra toll booth, and one each at West Point Filling Station in Tsopoli, Galaxy Filling Station in Dawhenya, and Akanu.</p>



<p>ICUMS further emphasised that 11 trucks were moved to a controlled holding point at the Tema Transit Yard, while the remaining trucks were traceable, located, physically verified, and handed over to Customs on Friday, 20 February.</p>



<p>The company reiterated that its tracking systems are designed to replace uncertainty with verifiable evidence, stating that playback data accounted for all trucks under the BOE, including those described in some media reports as missing.</p>



<p>Ghana Link acknowledged the seriousness of any suspected breaches of the transit regime and expressed support for lawful investigations by the GRA and other relevant state agencies, including National Security.</p>



<p>It maintained that its role is to provide reliable visibility over transit movements through tracking data and operational support to authorities, reaffirming its commitment to strengthening revenue mobilisation and facilitating trade in Ghana.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A French soldier has died after he was shot in the head while taking part in a game with other soldiers during a party, according to local media.</p>



<p>Brigadier Alexandre Lanckbeen was critically injured during the incident last Saturday while attending a party involving alcohol at the Percy Military Teaching Hospital in Clamart, west of Paris.</p>



<p>According to French prosecutors, a loaded handgun was discharged during what was described as a game between the soldiers, and a bullet struck Lanckbeen in the head.</p>



<p>Loïc Mizon, the military governor of Paris, said he had learned with &#8220;deep sadness&#8221; of the 20-year-old&#8217;s death on Friday as a result of his injuries.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wish to express my deepest compassion to his family and loved ones and assure them of the full support of the armed forces,&#8221; he said in a post on X.</p>



<p>Brigadier Lanckbeen served with the 35th Parachute Artillery Regiment based in Tarbes, and was deployed as part of Operation Sentinelle, a long-running domestic security operation.</p>



<p>According to prosecutors, on Saturday evening four soldiers housed at Percy Hospital had begun playing a game known within the military that involves attempting to disarm a colleague and disable their weapon.</p>



<p>The weapon is usually unloaded when the game is played but in this case it was not, according to local media.</p>



<p>During the game, a shot was fired which struck Lanckbeen in the head.</p>



<p>Three soldiers who were also deployed as part of Operation Sentinelle appeared before a Paris court on Tuesday in connection with the shooting, according to local media.</p>



<p>One soldier was charged with &#8220;violence with a weapon resulting in permanent disability and breaching orders by consuming alcohol&#8221;, reports said.</p>



<p>The other two soldiers were reportedly charged with &#8220;involuntary bodily harm resulting in a work incapacity exceeding three months, through a manifestly deliberate violation of regulatory obligation of safety or caution&#8221;.</p>



<p>They were also charged with &#8220;altering the scene of a crime or offense to obstruct the course of justice&#8221;.</p>



<p>Following Lanckbeen&#8217;s death, the charges are expected to be reclassified.</p>



<p>The inquiry has been handed to the criminal investigation service in Hauts-de-Seine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>More research on the threats of artificial intelligence (AI) &#8220;needs to be done urgently&#8221;, the boss of Google DeepMind has told BBC News.</p>



<p>In an exclusive interview at the AI Impact Summit in Delhi, Sir Demis Hassabis said the industry wanted &#8220;smart regulation&#8221; for &#8220;the real risks&#8221; posed by the tech.</p>



<p>Many tech leaders and politicians at the Summit have called for more global governance of AI, ahead of an expected joint statement as the event draws to a close.</p>



<p>But the US has rejected this stance, with White House technology adviser Michael Kratsios saying: &#8220;AI adoption cannot lead to a brighter future if it is subject to bureaucracies and centralised control.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sir Demis said it was important to build &#8220;robust guardrails&#8221; against the most serious threats from the rise of autonomous systems.</p>



<p>He said the two main threats were the technology being used by &#8220;bad actors&#8221;, and the risk of losing control of systems as they become more powerful.</p>



<p>When asked whether he had the power to slow down the progress of the tech to give experts more time to work on its challenges, he said his firm had an important role to play, but was &#8220;only one player in the ecosystem&#8221;.</p>



<p>But he admitted keeping up with the pace of AI development was &#8220;the hard thing&#8221; for regulators.</p>



<p>Sam Altman, the boss of OpenAI, also called for &#8220;urgent regulation&#8221; in a speech at the AI Summit, while Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi said countries had to work together to benefit from AI.</p>



<p>However, the US has taken the opposite view. &#8220;As the Trump administration has now said many times: We totally reject global governance of AI,&#8221; said the head of the US delegation Michael Kratsios.</p>

<p>Delegates from more than 100 countries, including several world leaders, are attending the event. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy MP represented the UK government.</p>



<p>Mr Lammy said the power wasn&#8217;t just with tech firms when it came to safety of AI and politicians need to work &#8220;hand in hand&#8221; with tech adding, &#8220;security and safety must come first and it must be of benefit for the wider public&#8221;.</p>



<p>Sir Demis believes the US and the west are &#8220;slightly&#8221; ahead in the race with China for AI dominance but added that it could be &#8220;only a matter of months&#8221; before China catches up.</p>



<p>He said he felt the responsibility to balance being &#8220;bold and responsible&#8221; about deploying AI systems out in the world.</p>



<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t always get things right,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;but we get it more correct than most&#8221;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Science education &#8216;still very important&#8217;</h2>



<p>In the next 10 years the tech would become &#8220;a superpower&#8221; in terms of what people would be able to create, Sir Demis, who won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s still very important to have a Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) education,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you have a technical background, I think it will still be an advantage in using these systems.&#8221;</p>



<p>He thinks AI writing code would open up the number of people who could build new applications, &#8220;and then maybe the key thing becomes taste and creativity and judgement&#8221;.</p>



<p>The AI Impact Summit is the largest ever global gathering of world leaders and tech bosses.</p>



<p>It ends on Friday with companies and countries expected to deliver a shared view of how to handle artificial intelligence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Gender Centre for Empowering Development (GenCED) has condemned what it describes as escalating cyberbullying and digital harassment targeting women in Ghana’s Parliament.</p>



<p>It warned that such attacks undermine democratic participation and discourage women from public service.</p>



<p>In a statement, the Centre expressed concern over online abuse directed at Millicent Amankwah Yeboah, Member of Parliament for Sunyani West, saying the attacks seek to demean her competence and dignity through ridicule of her speech and personal insults.</p>



<p>According to GenCED, the sustained online hostility reflects deep-seated gender bias and risks silencing women in leadership.</p>



<p>“This sustained online hostility, often framed as ridicule for speech and rhetorical style, reflects deep-seated gender bias and has the effect of discouraging women from full and confident participation in democratic discourse,” the statement said.</p>



<div data-wp-interactive="core/file" class="wp-block-file"><object data-wp-bind--hidden="!state.hasPdfPreview" hidden class="wp-block-file__embed" data="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LATEST.pdf" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%;height:600px" aria-label="Embed of LATEST."></object><a id="wp-block-file--media-26e11710-7267-46d6-9663-5a1d99eae101" href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LATEST.pdf">LATEST</a><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LATEST.pdf" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" download aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-26e11710-7267-46d6-9663-5a1d99eae101">Download</a></div>



<p>The organisation warned that the growing trend of online harassment, including derogatory comments, personal insults and threats, not only harms individuals but also signals to women and girls that their voices are unwelcome in public life.</p>



<p>GenCED cited recent data to highlight the scale of the problem. Monitoring by the Media Foundation for West Africa recorded 583 incidents of online gender-based violence targeting women, including female politicians and public figures, between August 2024 and March 2025 across major social media platforms.</p>



<p>National data from the Cyber Security Authority also shows cybercrime cases rising sharply in Ghana, with cyberbullying ranking among the top reported offences and accounting for hundreds of complaints in 2025 alone. In addition, a poll by UNICEF’s U-Report found that 49% of young people in Ghana have experienced online violence, often resulting in emotional distress.</p>



<p>The Centre noted that such patterns of abuse threaten democratic inclusion by intimidating women in public office and undermining equal participation in governance.</p>



<p>GenCED further pointed to Ghana’s legal framework, which recognises cyber harassment as a punishable offence. The Cyber Crimes Act, 2025 criminalises online harassment and cyberbullying, including the use of digital platforms to humiliate or insult individuals, with penalties including fines or imprisonment. It said additional protections are provided under the Cybersecurity Act, 2020 (Act 1038) and related electronic communications laws.</p>



<p>Despite these provisions, the organisation argued that enforcement remains weak, allowing online gender-based abuse to continue with little accountability.</p>



<p>The Centre stressed that cyberbullying against elected officials, particularly on the basis of gender or language, constitutes gender-based political violence and has no place in a democratic society. It called on political parties, state institutions, media organisations and online platforms to uphold standards of respect, dignity and equality in digital engagement.</p>



<p>GenCED urged law enforcement and regulatory bodies to apply cybercrime laws decisively against perpetrators, while calling on parliamentary leadership to publicly condemn online abuse targeting MPs and support measures to protect digital civic space. It also encouraged media organisations and online platforms to strengthen moderation systems and promote digital literacy.</p>



<p>The organisation further appealed to Ghanaian citizens to reject misogynistic attacks online and instead promote constructive debate focused on policy rather than personal attacks.</p>



<p>It emphasised that Millicent Amankwah Yeboah, like all elected representatives, has a constitutional mandate to serve her constituents without fear of digital intimidation, adding that Ghana’s democracy is strengthened by diverse voices and respectful public discourse.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Three Cameroonian soldiers have been sentenced to prison for their role in the killing of at least 21 civilians in the country's troubled Anglophone region.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Three Cameroonian soldiers have been sentenced to prison for their role in the killing of at least 21 civilians in the country&#8217;s troubled Anglophone region.</p>



<p>The jail terms for the crimes, which took place six years ago in the Northwest region, range from five to 10 years per person.</p>



<p>A military court previously found the soldiers guilty of murder, arson and destruction &#8211; a rare occurrence in a country where military personnel are seldom convicted of crimes against civilians.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, lawyers for the victims told the BBC they were disappointed with the length of the jail terms handed down on Thursday, calling them &#8220;insignificant&#8221;.</p>



<p>The convictions centre on the events of 14 February 2020, when soldiers, supported by a local militia of ethnic Fulanis, raided the village of Ngarbuh and killed civilians.</p>



<p>The victims included 13 children, according to Human Rights Watch, who added that the assailants burnt down homes and beat up residents.</p>



<p>What followed was a rare instance of Cameroon&#8217;s government acknowledging the atrocities of its soldiers in the Anglophone regions, which have been wracked by a separatist conflict for nearly 10 years.</p>



<p>The authorities initially denied responsibility for the attack on Ngarbuh but later backpedalled following international pressure and the findings of an investigation ordered by the country&#8217;s President, Paul Biya.</p>



<p>Alongside the three soldiers sentenced on Thursday evening, a militia member also received a jail term for murder, arson and destruction.</p>



<p>One of the victims&#8217; lawyers, Sother Menkem, told the BBC: &#8220;The sentence was so mild, I even qualify it as friendly because we are talking of a massacre.&#8221;</p>



<p>Menkem pointed out that under Cameroonian law, the minimum sentence for felonies such as murder and arson is 10 years.</p>



<p>&#8220;I expected at least 30 years&#8217; imprisonment or more because [the soldiers] instilled much fear on the inhabitants of that area,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The soldiers&#8217; lawyers argued that their clients were merely doing their job.</p>



<p>A man who lost several relatives in the February 2020 attack told the BBC he needed time to process the court&#8217;s decision.</p>



<p>He has since moved out of the conflict-hit region for safety reasons.</p>



<p>The military court rejected the victims&#8217; demand for compensation, a move decried by another of their lawyers, Richard Tamfu.</p>



<p>Human Rights Watch and legal representatives of the victims have insisted that the soldiers were acting on the instructions from their superiors and therefore criticise the fact that no senior military officer was prosecuted at the trial.</p>



<p>The case dragged on for six years after hearings were postponed multiple times.</p>



<p>Since 2017, separatist fighters in the country&#8217;s two English-speaking regions have been campaigning for the creation of a breakaway state.</p>



<p>Human rights groups have accused both the rebels and state forces of committing widespread abuses.</p>



<p>The UN says the conflict has killed at least 6,000 people and forced over half a million others to flee their homes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A 33-year-old trader who allegedly stole a four-day-old baby at the Mamprobi Polyclinic in Accra has been remanded by the Domestic Violence and Victims Support Unit Court in Accra.</p>



<p>Latifa Salifu, a mother of two, has been charged with one count of child stealing before the court presided over by K. K. Obiri Yeboah.</p>



<p>Her plea in respect of the charge was not taken as investigations are still ongoing.</p>



<p>The prosecution, led by Chief Inspector Opoku Aniagyei, told the court that investigations were still ongoing and prayed for the accused to be remanded in custody.</p>



<p>“We want the accused to be remanded to allow us to complete our investigations,” he said.</p>



<p>However, counsel for the accused, Hamisu Muhammad, pleaded with the court to grant his client bail, arguing that Salifu was not a flight risk and had never had a brush with the law.</p>



<p>“My client will not interfere with police investigations and witnesses because she does not have the resources to interfere and does not have the resources to abscond,” the counsel submitted.</p>



<p>He added that his client had men who were ready to stand in as sureties.</p>



<p>The prosecution opposed the bail application, indicating that police suspected the alleged theft may have been orchestrated by a syndicate.</p>



<p>“There is no sense that the accused, who has children who are boys, will still go to the hospital to steal a boy.</p>



<p>“We want the accused remanded to help with investigations,” the prosecutor said.</p>



<p>The judge sided with the prosecution and remanded the accused to reappear on March 4, 2026.</p>



<p><strong>Prosecution’s case</strong></p>



<p>Narrating the facts, Chief Inspector Aniagyei said that on February 14 this year, the mother of the four-day-old baby delivered at the hospital through a caesarean section.</p>



<p>He said the baby was subsequently referred to the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital for further treatment.</p>



<p>On February 17, 2026, while the mother was at the recovery ward, the prosecutor said a woman dressed in a peach-coloured scrub uniform posed as a nurse, came to her bed, looked at the baby and the mother, and left.</p>



<p>Later that day, at about 4 p.m., the accused allegedly returned to the mother under the pretext of administering medicine to the baby.</p>



<p>About 10 minutes later, Chief Inspector Aniagyei said a nurse approached the mother to ask about the baby, but she informed the nurse that the accused had taken the child and described her appearance.</p>



<p>He said nurses on duty searched the hospital premises but could not find the accused.</p>



<p>The complainant subsequently lodged a report with the Mamprobi Police.</p>



<p>On February 18, 2026, a whistleblower informed the Dansoman Police that the accused had been seen with the baby at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital.</p>



<p>“With the help of the Dansoman Police patrol team, the accused was arrested and brought to the Police station together with the baby.</p>



<p>“The accused in her Police investigation caution statement admitted the offence and stated that she went to pick up the baby from the victim under the pretext of administering medicine for her and bolted with the baby,” the prosecutor told the court.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The United States Embassy in Ghana has cautioned Ghanaian football fans planning to travel to the United States for this year’s World Cup not to overstay their authorised period of stay.</p>



<p>At a news conference in Accra on Friday, February 20, Chargé d’Affaires Rolf Olson stressed that securing a visa and purchasing a match ticket do not exempt visitors from complying with American immigration laws.</p>



<p>He stated that every country enforces its own immigration regulations and expects visitors to abide by them.</p>



<p>“I think it’s important to clarify something. Every country has its immigration practices and laws. And this is certainly true of Ghana as well,” he said. </p>



<p>“When a government issues a visa to a visitor for whatever purpose, for whatever length of time, it’s really incumbent upon that visitor to respect the laws of the country that they are in. And that’s both in terms of their conduct in the country, as well as how long they stay.”</p>



<p>Mr. Olson explained that a visa does not automatically guarantee entry or determine how long a visitor may remain in the United States. Rather, he noted, the visa permits a traveller to board a flight and seek admission at a U.S. port of entry.</p>



<p>“The visa itself is a permission to apply for entry at the port of entry. So the visa allows you to get on the plane. Without the visa, the airline won’t let you travel,” he said. </p>



<p>“You get to the border at the airport… it is the Customs and Border Patrol officer who then officially grants you entry into the country. It is that individual who will determine how long you have to stay.”</p>



<p>According to him, while the standard period for a B visa is generally six months, the duration is not automatic and may be shorter, depending on the decision of the Customs and Border Protection officer.</p>



<p>“If they give you 90 days, you have 90 days. If you have the six months, six months is a long time. And I think we can all agree that six months is enough time to go watch the World Cup matches, spend some time with friends, go on a vacation if you want to do that, and still return,” he said.</p>



<p>He further reminded applicants that although Ghanaian travellers often receive five-year multiple-entry visas, that validity is not guaranteed and remains at the discretion of the consular officer.</p>



<p>“There is no automatic five-year multiple-entry. But that is generally the standard, and we generally apply that for most travellers,” he noted, adding that visitors who comply with visa terms would have opportunities to travel again in the future.</p>



<p>Mr. Olson disclosed that he has engaged Ghanaian authorities on the expected travel arrangements for the tournament and urged prospective travellers not to abuse the opportunity.</p>



<p>“We very, very strongly encourage people and expect people who are granted a visa to go to the U.S. and observe the terms of that visa, from the length of time they’re there to what they’re actually doing,” he said. </p>



<p>“People who have exceeded the terms of their visa are breaking the law. And needless to say, we take that very seriously in the United States.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As the world observes World Day of Social Justice today, under the compelling theme “Empowering Inclusion: Bridging Gaps for Social Justice”, the Christian Council of Ghana (CCG) has expressed solemn solidarity with the global call to dismantle barriers of exclusion, inequality, and marginalisation.</p>



<p>The Council emphasises that this commitment is not only a civic duty but also a moral obligation and a profound expression of faith. Citing Psalm 89:14 — “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; love and faithfulness go before you” — the CCG draws a direct connection between divine principles and Ghana’s cherished national motto, “Freedom and Justice”, emblazoned upon the country’s Coat of Arms since independence. </p>



<div data-wp-interactive="core/file" class="wp-block-file"><object data-wp-bind--hidden="!state.hasPdfPreview" hidden class="wp-block-file__embed" data="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CCG_WORLD-DAY-OF-SOCIAL-JUSTICE_2026-2.pdf" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%;height:600px" aria-label="Embed of CCG_WORLD DAY OF SOCIAL JUSTICE_2026 (2)."></object><a id="wp-block-file--media-41a44f3b-01df-4711-9472-982d5ef50585" href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CCG_WORLD-DAY-OF-SOCIAL-JUSTICE_2026-2.pdf">CCG_WORLD DAY OF SOCIAL JUSTICE_2026 (2)</a><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CCG_WORLD-DAY-OF-SOCIAL-JUSTICE_2026-2.pdf" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" download aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-41a44f3b-01df-4711-9472-982d5ef50585">Download</a></div>



<p>This motto, inscribed by forebears emerging from colonial oppression, symbolises a covenantal aspiration: genuine freedom from bondage and just treatment for every citizen, irrespective of socioeconomic status or religious background.</p>



<p>In contemporary Ghana, the pursuit of empowering inclusion reflects this sacred alignment. Bridging societal gaps involves extending the freedoms promised in the national motto to those still constrained by poverty, discrimination, unemployment, disability, gender inequality, rural neglect, and inadequate social protection. </p>



<p>For the CCG, justice must be a lived reality, ensuring that widows, orphans, strangers, youth, and the elderly experience the dignity intended by God (Deuteronomy 10:18; Isaiah 1:17).</p>



<p>On this World Day of Social Justice, the Council has called upon the Government of Ghana and all stakeholders in nation-building to address systemic discrimination, economic disparity, and governance challenges that hinder inclusive prosperity. </p>



<p>The CCG also hopes that the Global South will witness true freedom and justice grounded in collective welfare, rather than the interests of a privileged few.</p>

<p>The Council commended President Mahama for his dedication to social justice through initiatives such as the National Apprenticeship Programme, MahamaCares (Ghana Medical Trust Fund), No-Fees-Stress Initiative, free tertiary education for persons with disabilities, free sanitary pads distribution, the Adwumawura Programme, expansion of the LEAP Programme, and free primary healthcare. </p>



<p>While acknowledging these policies as commendable, the CCG stressed that their effective and equitable implementation is crucial to benefit all intended recipients, fostering a just, progressive, and prosperous society.</p>



<p>Despite these efforts, the Council noted that government action alone cannot fully achieve social justice. On this occasion, the CCG called on the religious community and development partners, including the United Nations (UN), to collaborate in promoting social justice, particularly in regions where race, gender, sexuality, or economic status hinder access to fundamental rights and social services.</p>



<p>The Council specifically highlighted the persistent challenge of “no bed syndrome” in healthcare as an affront to social justice. Every Ghanaian and resident of Ghana, it asserted, deserves timely emergency care to realise their God-given potential.</p>



<p>Coming on the third day of Lent, a period of penitence, reflection, and beneficence, the Council urged citizens to embody the principles of Isaiah 58:1–12 by acting justly and compassionately towards the poor, vulnerable, and socially disadvantaged.</p>



<p>The CCG prayed that the observance of World Day of Social Justice, celebrated globally under the auspices of the United Nations, would bring humanity closer to its divine calling to be one another’s keeper. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The New Juaben South Metropolitan Chief Executive (MCE), Ransford Owusu Boakye, has visited the family of Constance Nyarko, a native of Srodae in Koforidua, who fell victim to the recent tragic terrorist attack in Burkina Faso that claimed eight Ghanaian lives.</p>



<p>Constance, affectionately known as Yaa Yaa, was among a group of Ghanaian traders travelling through northern Burkina Faso when they were ambushed by suspected insurgents.</p>



<p>During his visit, Mr. Boakye extended heartfelt condolences to the grieving family and assured them that the government would provide support for her burial arrangements.</p>



<p>Speaking to Adom News, Yaa Agyeiwaa, mother of the deceased, said Constance was the family’s sole breadwinner and left behind two children, making the loss particularly devastating.</p>



<p>Members of the Juaben Sewaa Market community, including tomato sellers, also expressed their sympathies and urged authorities to strengthen security for traders traveling abroad.</p>



<p>The incident has deeply affected the community, who remember Constance for her resilience, dedication, and hardworking nature.</p>



<p>Ransford Owusu Boakye reaffirmed the government’s commitment to supporting the family during this difficult time.</p>

<p>Cocoa farmers have picketed the headquarters of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) in Accra, intensifying protests over falling producer prices and delayed payments that they say are pushing farming households into economic distress.</p>



<p>Carrying placards and chanting slogans, the farmers accused authorities of failing to honour commitments to protect their livelihoods. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="http://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WhatsApp-Video-2026-02-20-at-5.10.53-PM.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Some of the inscriptions on Friday, February 20, read: “We worked, you lied,” “Government celebrates but our families mourn,” and “We can’t pay our kids’ school fees,” among others.</p>

<p>The messages captured the depth of frustration among farmers who say their incomes have been eroded despite their role in sustaining one of Ghana’s most critical export sectors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="http://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WhatsApp-Video-2026-02-20-at-5.06.16-PM.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>The protesters are demanding an urgent upward review of the cocoa producer price and the settlement of outstanding payments owed to them by Licensed Buying Companies operating under COCOBOD’s supervision.</p>

<p>&#8220;The prices were not reduced under the previous regimes; why is this administration reducing it. We have no problem with the government, they should just leave the prices to remain the same,&#8221; a frustrated woman told journalists.</p>



<p>According to the farmers, delays in payment and the recent downward adjustment in cocoa prices have made it increasingly difficult to cover basic household needs, including school fees, healthcare, and farm maintenance.</p>

<p>“We depend entirely on cocoa. When payments delay or prices drop, our families suffer,” one protester said, adding that many farmers are struggling to prepare for the next crop season due to lack of funds.</p>



<p>The demonstration at COCOBOD headquarters follows similar protests in cocoa-growing regions, particularly in the Western North Region, where farmers marched through major towns to protest the reduced farmgate price.</p>

<p>The unrest comes amid broader challenges facing Ghana’s cocoa sector, including global price volatility, declining output in some regions, and financial pressures on COCOBOD. </p>



<p>Although COCOBOD has announced payments to Licensed Buying Companies to facilitate farmer payments, many producers say the relief has yet to reach them at the farmgate level.</p>

<p>Farmer groups warn that without immediate intervention, many producers may abandon cocoa farming altogether or reduce investment in their farms, potentially affecting future production levels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President John Mahama has announced that the government’s ban on the export of non-ferrous scrap is expected to boost Ghana’s processed metal exports by between &#8220;$250 million and $300 million annually&#8221;, describing the move as a decisive step toward strengthening the country’s industrial base.</p>



<p>Speaking at the commissioning of the B5 Plus Limited Steel Manufacturing Plant at Prampram on Friday, February 20, the President said the policy is designed to secure raw materials for local manufacturers and accelerate value addition in the metals industry.</p>



<p>He explained that Ghana generates substantial volumes of scrap metal each year through construction, demolition, vehicle imports and other industrial activities. However, for years, a significant portion of that scrap has been exported in its raw form.</p>



<p>“Industrial capacity requires raw material security. By restricting non-ferrous scrap exports, the government ensures local processors have priority access to raw material for their production,” he said.</p>



<p>According to him, the policy will not only increase processed metal exports but also create between 5,000 and 10,000 new jobs across the value chain.</p>



<p>President Mahama added that the move would further enhance domestic revenue mobilisation through value-added tax, corporate taxes and pay-as-you-earn contributions.</p>



<p>He commended B5 Plus Group for its tax compliance, noting that the company is among the Ghana Revenue Authority’s most reliable taxpayers. </p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve paid more than $300 million in taxes and are looking to exceed $500 million very soon.&#8221;</p>



<p>While acknowledging concerns raised by the company over frequent audits, he suggested that regulatory oversight must be balanced and predictable.</p>



<p>The President said the broader objective is to move Ghana up the value chain by exporting finished and semi-finished products rather than raw scrap materials.</p>



<p>Linking the policy to the government’s “Big Push” infrastructure agenda, he said massive investments in roads, highways, railway modernisation, bridges, interchanges, energy transmission lines, affordable housing and industrial parks will require a strong and reliable supply of iron and steel.</p>



<p>&#8220;Africa is projected to require over $100 billion annually in infrastructure development. West Africa alone faces significant infrastructure deficits. </p>



<p>&#8220;If Ghana develops a strong steel base, we not only build our own roads and bridges, we will also supply steel to the whole sub-region. This is how infrastructure becomes industrial strategy. The 24-hour economy program is particularly relevant to energy-intensive industries such as steel manufacturing,&#8221; President Mahama added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Growth in the US slowed at the end of last year, as consumer spending slackened and the federal government shut down.</p>



<p>The world&#8217;s largest economy grew at an annual pace of 1.4%% in the three months to December, falling back from a robust 4.4% in the prior quarter.</p>



<p>It capped a turbulent year for the US economy, which has been buffeted by new tariffs, a crackdown on immigration, cuts to government spending and persistent inflation.</p>



<p>Overall, the economy grew 2.2% in 2025, performing better than many had anticipated in the face of those pressures.</p>



<p>&#8220;The core of the economy is resilient,&#8221; Michael Pearce, chief US economist at Oxford Economics wrote on Friday, adding that he expected growth to pick up again this year.</p>



<p>Despite the underlying momentum, sharp swings in trade policy last year sent the economic data on a roller coaster ride.</p>



<p>The year started in a mild contraction, fuelled in part by a jump in imports &#8211; which subtract from growth in calculations of gross domestic product (GDP) &#8211; as firms rushed goods into the country ahead of anticipated tariffs.</p>



<p>Growth bounced back in the spring and summer, as foreign imports slowed, before decelerating again in the final months of the year, as imports started to recover.</p>



<p>The release of trade data on Thursday &#8211; which showed the trade deficit widening in December &#8211; had prompted a flurry of last-minute, downward revisions to growth forecasts for the October-December period.</p>



<p>But the slowdown was still more severe than many economists had anticipated.</p>



<p>While private investment picked up, it remained largely concentrated in intellectual property and IT-related equipment.</p>



<p>Consumer spending rose 2.4%, cooling from 3.5% in the prior quarter.</p>



<p>Government spending plunged more than 16%.</p>



<p>&#8220;The government shutdown ended up being a much bigger drag on the economy&#8221; than other data had suggested, Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics wrote in a note. He said he expected that decline to be reversed in the months ahead.</p>



<p>Before publication of the report, US President Donald Trump tried to temper expectations, pointing to the shutdown, which he blamed on Democrats. He said it &#8220;cost the USA at least two points in GDP&#8221;.</p>



<p>In its report, the Commerce Department estimated that losses from the suspension of federal government services had subtracted one percentage point from GDP in the fourth quarter, while noting that the full impact was likely larger.</p>



<p>A separate report showed an uptick in the measure of inflation preferred by the US central bank &#8211; the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. It hit 2.9% in December, up from 2.8% in the prior month.</p>



<p>While analysts said the fourth quarter slowdown was unlikely to cause significant alarm, given the role of the shutdown, they said the inflation figure could give Federal Reserve officials pause.</p>



<p>&#8220;This PCE report is a reality check,&#8221; Olu Sonola, head of US economics at Fitch Ratings wrote in a note. He added that the figures could undercut arguments for the bank to start lowering interest rates again this year.</p>



<p>&#8220;The market may be pricing multiple cuts this year—but the Fed&#8217;s preferred inflation gauge is telling policymakers, &#8216;Not yet&#8217;,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The Chief Executive Officer of the Social Investment Fund (SIF), Lawyer Abass Nurudeen, says the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) has accepted the Chief Justice’s ruling dismissing the petition against the Electoral Commission Chairperson and her deputies.</p>



<p>Chief Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie has ruled that there is no prima facie case to proceed with petitions seeking the removal of the Electoral Commission Chair, Jean Mensa, and her deputies, Dr. Bossman Eric Asare and Samuel Tettey.</p>



<p>The decision was confirmed in a statement issued on Wednesday, February 18, by the Minister of Government Communications.</p>



<p>Reacting to the ruling on Kumasi-based&nbsp;<strong>Nhyria FM’s “Kro Yi Mu Nsem</strong>“, Abass Nurudeen said NDC supporters are disappointed with the ruling, but the party will respect the decision.</p>



<p>Abass, who is also the Ashanti Regional Communications Director of the NDC, appealed to party faithful to stay calm, emphasizing the party’s commitment to democratic values despite their disappointment with the ruling.</p>



<p>“I’ll urge them to stay calm and understand that being in government doesn’t automatically guarantee favorable outcomes in every case,” he said.</p>



<p>He reiterated that the EC Chair and her deputies lack competence, pointing to the numerous mistakes they made with the presidential results during the 2020 general elections.</p>



<p>He claimed that EC officials failed to learn from their 2020 general election mistakes, repeating them in the 2024 elections, specifically citing the Akwatia and Kpandai parliamentary election results processes.</p>



<p>He warned that if the Electoral Commission continues to make such mistakes, it could lead to conflict, posing a danger to the nation.</p>



<p>“As an NDC member, I think Madam Jean Mensah, Dr. Bossman Eric Asare, and Samuel Tettey shouldn’t remain in their EC positions, given what happened in the 2020 and 2024 general elections. These petitions should be a wake-up call for them.”</p>



<p>Dr. Henry Kwabena Kokofu, a former EPA Executive Director and NPP stalwart, hailed the Chief Justice’s ruling on the petition against the EC bosses and OSP as a victory for Ghana’s democracy.</p>



<p>He said everyone is guided by the Constitution, so if the Chief Justice and the Supreme Court have ruled based on it, then that is the way to go.</p>



<p>When asked whether he trusts the judiciary under Baffoe-Bonnie, he said he has had trust in Chief Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie for a long time.</p>



<p>“I’ve had trust in Chief Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie for a long time, but it’s not because of his ruling on the petition against the EC bosses and OSP,” he told the host, Barima Kofi Dawson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minority Caucus in Parliament has accused the administration of President John Dramani Mahama of presiding over what it describes as a significant decline in revenue performance, warning that fiscal consolidation claims do not reflect the underlying realities.</p>



<p>In a statement signed by Frank Annoh-Dompreh, Minority Chief Whip, the Caucus asserted that the government inherited a revenue-to-GDP ratio of 16 per cent but had seen it fall to 11 per cent by the third quarter of last year.</p>



<p>The statement described this as “a loss of approximately five per cent of GDP in revenue performance”, which it said explains expenditure constraints, salary arrears, and funding backlogs across the public sector.</p>



<p>“Fiscal discipline built on collapsing revenue is not reform; it is institutional contraction and state weakness,” the Minority declared.</p>



<p>It argued that while the government speaks of consolidation and prudence, the shrinking revenue base undermines the state’s capacity to deliver essential services and sustain development commitments.</p>



<p>The Caucus further contended that sterilisation policies aimed at curbing inflation have compounded economic hardship.</p>



<p>It pointed to the withdrawal of over GH¢60 billion from circulation, as acknowledged in the 2026 Budget, stating that this has constrained liquidity and dampened economic activity.</p>



<p>“What citizens are experiencing is not macroeconomic stability, but deliberate economic dryness,” the statement read.</p>



<p>The Minority concluded that economic management must prioritise structural growth and revenue expansion rather than contractionary measures.</p>



<p>“Governance must be grounded in sustainability and long-term resilience,” the statement emphasised, cautioning against what it termed short-term optics at the expense of enduring reform.</p>

<p>The Minority Caucus has expressed concern that Ghana is returning to what it describes as dangerous over-reliance on commodity prices to sustain economic stability.</p>



<p>In its latest statement, the Caucus warned that improvements in macroeconomic indicators are being driven largely by global gold prices rather than domestic structural reforms.</p>



<p>The statement commended the Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana) for initiating a one-year performance review of the Mahama administration, but urged civil society groups to examine “methods, costs and sustainability” beyond headline figures.</p>



<p>“Without subjecting recent developments to these three tests, national discourse is reduced to slogans, not governance,” the Minority stated.</p>



<p>On the cocoa sector, the Caucus claimed farmers are losing more than GH¢1,000 per bag due to structural changes in trading systems and the removal of stabilisation and hedging buffers.</p>



<p>“Economic resets that shift global market risks onto vulnerable farmers are not reforms; they are policy injustice,” the statement said, adding that the Minority had formally demanded corrective measures.</p>



<p>The Caucus further criticised what it termed declining fiscal performance, alleging that revenue-to-GDP ratios had dropped from 16 per cent to 11 per cent by the third quarter of last year.</p>



<p>It argued that fiscal consolidation “built on collapsing revenue is not reform; it is institutional contraction and state weakness”.</p>



<p>Ending on a cautionary note, the Minority stated that “this is not economic resilience; it is renewed commodity dependence and a return to old structural vulnerabilities”.</p>



<p>It urged continuous and technical national accountability, insisting that “Ghana deserves methods that work, costs that are justified, and sustainable policies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Parliament was thrown into a heated debate as Members of Parliament traded accusations and counter-accusations over the recent terrorist attack in Burkina Faso that claimed the lives of eight Ghanaian tomato traders.</p>



<p>The Minority side demanded urgent action, calling for a Parliamentary inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the killings, as well as state compensation and support for the families of the victims.</p>



<p>Raising the issue on the floor of Parliament, the Deputy Ranking Member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Nana Asafo Adjei-Ayeh, questioned whether Ghanaian authorities had acted on intelligence warnings and demanded accountability.</p>



<p>“The Minority demands the following: an immediate parliamentary enquiry into the circumstances surrounding this tragedy, including whether prior intelligence warnings existed and what steps, if any, were taken to protect Ghanaian traders operating in high-risk zones. Full compensation and state support for the families of the deceased and the injured,” he said.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/ghanaians-death-toll-in-burkina-faso-terror-attack-now-8/">Read also: Ghanaians death toll in Burkina Faso terror attack now 8</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Ranking Member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Samuel Abu Jinapor, further argued that Ghanaian civilians had been exposed to danger following heightened security risks in Burkina Faso, stressing that the victims were non-combatants.</p>



<p>“The president of Burkina Faso, General Ibrahim Traore, became a special guest at the inauguration of President Mahama, and I&#8217;m not saying it, security experts indicated, Mr. Speaker, that Ghanaians were going to become targets.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OgLYRujM1sE?si=R7AEXtpT2sut9Gm2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>&#8220;And indeed, these traders, Mr. Speaker, let&#8217;s ask ourselves the fundamental question. These traders are not combatants. These traders do not play any role in the conflict in Burkina Faso,” Mr Jinapor added.</p>



<p>However, the debate quickly took a political turn when National Democratic Congress (NDC) MP Samuel Atta Mills shifted focus to domestic agricultural policy, accusing the previous government of failing northern farming communities through the stalled Pwalugu irrigation project.</p>



<p>“Your former flagbearer, who&#8217;s now your new flagbearer, went on TV and said the best thing he has ever done in the north was the Pwalugu &nbsp;Dam. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/govt-engages-burkina-faso-over-safety-of-ghanaian-tomato-traders-dumelo/">Read also: Govt engages Burkina Faso over safety of Ghanaian tomato traders — Dumelo</a></li>
</ul>



<p>&#8220;This Pwalugu Dam was supposed to help us irrigate the land and grow tomatoes in the north. We spent about $12 million, and we have nothing to show for it. If this dam had been built, we would be able to grow our tomatoes up north,” he argued.</p>



<p>The comments drew strong opposition from the Minority, prompting a response from Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin, who rejected allegations of financial abuse and challenged the government on its economic promises.</p>



<p>“The honorable member, who is the majority leader, is a lawyer, and he knows. I challenge him to come out with any evidence to suggest or point to a person who has abused any so-called money. </p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. Speaker, his party is in government. Where is their 24-hour economy? Where is the one job, three shifts? If you create jobs in Pwalugu, it will help the poor in that part of the region,&#8221; Mr Afenyo-Markin asked.</p>



<p>Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga escalated the exchange, linking the tragedy directly to the failure of the irrigation project.</p>



<p>“If the Pwalugu multipurpose dam had been constructed, the women will not be going to Burkina Faso. When you take $12 million dollars to do irrigation for them, do the irrigation. </p>



<p>&#8220;You chop the money and drove the women into Burkina Faso to buy tomatoes, and they went and died there. And you want to come and do politics in this chamber,” he said.</p>

<p>In a statement issued during a civil society assessment of the administration, the Caucus argued that democracy must be anchored in “accountability, evidence, and truth” rather than “propaganda, symbolism, and headline management”.</p>



<p>The statement, signed by Frank Annoh-Dompreh, Minority Chief Whip, criticised the government’s handling of currency stability.</p>



<p>According to the Minority, the relative calm in the foreign exchange market has been achieved through “aggressive forex market intervention and depletion of Ghana’s hard-earned gold reserves.”</p>



<p>The Caucus warned that “stability achieved through reserve exhaustion is not success; it is deferred economic collapse”.</p>



<p>It further alleged that more than $10 billion was spent in 2025 alone on market interventions, raising concerns about the opportunity cost of depleted reserves.</p>



<p>The Minority also expressed alarm over suggestions that gold sourced from illegal mining operations could be entering the national value chain to support foreign exchange operations, describing the environmental and health implications as “a major source of worry”.</p>



<p>On inflation, the Caucus claimed that government measures had created “economic suffocation disguised as discipline.”</p>



<p>It cited the 2026 Budget’s admission that over GH¢60 billion had been withdrawn from circulation through sterilisation policies, arguing that such measures have suppressed liquidity, weakened credit markets, and constrained business growth. “Inflation control that destroys economic life is not discipline; it is economic suffocation,” the statement declared.</p>



<p>Concluding, the Minority insisted that governance must be grounded in structural reform and sustainability.</p>



<p>“Ghana cannot build its future on a currency peg sustained by structural economic weakening,” the statement read, adding that “stability without sustainability is deception; growth without structure is collapse in waiting”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) Ghana and National Chairman of the General Transport, Petroleum and Chemical Workers Union, Bernard Owusu, has strongly condemned the recent salary reductions imposed on Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) workers.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on&nbsp;<em><strong>Adom FM’s morning show Dwaso Nsem</strong></em>, Mr. Owusu questioned the logic behind making workers bear the brunt of declining global cocoa prices.</p>



<p>“We will not accept salary cuts because of declining world cocoa prices. The COCOBOD worker did not set international cocoa prices. The worker does not control the global market. The worker is not responsible for economic mismanagement. So why must the worker suffer?” he said.</p>



<p>Mr. Owusu stressed the stark income disparity between management and workers.</p>



<p>“When CEOs earn GH₵200,000 a month, and workers earn GH₵10,000–20,000, the gap is clear. Yet in difficult times, it is the worker they want to sacrifice,” he stated.</p>



<p>The TUC chairman also said the cuts appear to violate existing agreements.</p>



<p>“The imposed salary reductions are contrary to our Collective Bargaining Agreement. Salary matters must be negotiated with the recognized unions—not imposed unilaterally. COCOBOD workers are not shock absorbers,” Owusu warned.</p>



<p>He listed the union’s demands, stressing fairness and transparency.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TUC-ON-COCOBOD-PAY-CUT-1.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>“We demand respect for the CBA, proper union engagement, full transparency, and shared responsibility. An injury to one is an injury to all. Solidarity forever.”</p>



<p>His comments follow COCOBOD’s announcement that Executive Management would take a 20% pay cut, while Senior Staff accepted a 10% reduction for the remainder of the 2025/26 crop year, citing liquidity challenges in the cocoa industry.</p>



<p>But Mr. Owusu reiterated that workers should not be made to pay for circumstances beyond their control.</p>



<p>“We call on COCOBOD and government authorities to ensure that workers are protected and that their rights under the union agreements are respected,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana&#8217;s emergency care system is at a defining moment. For years, the phrase &#8220;no bed syndrome&#8221; has echoed across the country, symbolising the frustration of families who watch critically ill patients being turned away from multiple hospitals. But the deeper truth is this: the crisis is not simply about the number of beds. It is about how the system functions.</p>



<p>As an emergency physician working on the frontlines, I have seen firsthand that &#8220;no bed syndrome&#8221; is not a shortage problem — it is a coordination problem. It is a flow problem. It is a systems problem.</p>



<p>And systems problems require modern, proactive, system wide solutions.</p>



<p>Ghana now has a clear opportunity to redesign emergency care through practical, affordable, and globally aligned approaches.</p>



<p>The Real Issue: A System Under Strain, not a Lack of Beds or Mattresses.</p>



<p>The public often imagines &#8220;no bed syndrome&#8221; as a physical shortage of beds. The root causes are structural:</p>



<p>There are;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>No unified emergency triage system</li>



<li>No real-time visibility of bed availability</li>



<li>Slow internal patient flow</li>



<li>Weak ambulance-hospital coordination</li>



<li>Lack of accountability for emergency refusals</li>
</ul>



<p>These gaps create delays, diversions, and preventable deaths — even when beds exist. Ending this crisis requires a modern emergency care ecosystem, not just more infrastructure.</p>



<p>A Modern, Proactive Framework for Ending &#8220;No Bed Syndrome&#8221;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>National Emergency Triage &amp; Stabilisation Standards</li>
</ol>



<p>Every emergency patient that reports to a medical facility in Ghana must be:</p>



<p>-I- Assessed immediately, -I- Stabilised, and</p>



<p>-I- Coordinated for transfer if needed, following established national referral pathways. This will replace the outdated practice of refusing patients at the gate.</p>



<p>A unified triage system, adapted from global best practices, ensures that the sickest patients receive urgent care without delay.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Real-Time Bed Visibility Across Hospitals</li>
</ul>



<p>A modern health system cannot operate on guesswork. Accra&#8217;s major hospitals should be digitally interconnected, allowing ambulance teams to know — in real time — where capacity exists.</p>



<p>Ghana needs a simple, scalable bed-visibility system that works in both digital and low-resource settings.</p>



<p>This includes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Structured manual reporting for facilities with limited connectivity</li>



<li>A digital dashboard for larger hospitals</li>



<li>Integration with ambulance dispatch</li>
</ul>



<p>This single reform eliminates unnecessary diversions and saves lives.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Faster Internal Patient Flow</li>
</ul>



<p>Beds are often unavailable at the entry points of major hospitals because patients stay longer than necessary due to slow processes.</p>



<p>Modern flow reforms include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Dedicated Bed Managers</li>



<li>Early discharge planning</li>



<li>Short-stay/observation units</li>



<li>Daily &#8220;flow huddles&#8221; between ED and wards</li>
</ul>



<p>These measures free up beds faster and reduce emergency department congestion.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Strong Ambulance-Hospital Coordination</li>
</ul>



<p>Ambulances must not roam from hospital to hospital. A modern system requires:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Pre-arrival communication</li>



<li>Acceptance-before-arrival rules</li>



<li>Routing guided by real-time bed visibility</li>
</ul>



<p>This protects patients from dangerous delays and ensures ambulances deliver patients to the right facility the first time.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Data, Monitoring &amp; Accountability</li>
</ul>



<p>For the first time, &#8220;no bed&#8221; refusals must become a reportable event. Hospitals should track:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Emergency refusals</li>



<li>ED boarding time</li>



<li>Bed occupancy</li>



<li>Deaths in transit</li>



<li>Ambulance diversions</li>
</ul>



<p>Weekly dashboards and monthly reviews create transparency and drive improvement.</p>



<p>A Smarter, Scalable, Ghana-Ready Solution This modern approach is:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Low-cost</li>



<li>Scalable across all regions</li>



<li>Compatible with both digital and low-resource facilities</li>



<li>Aligned with global emergency care standards</li>
</ul>



<p>It does not require massive new buildings. It requires coordination, visibility, and system design, including continuous monitoring and evaluation.</p>



<p>A New Era for Emergency Care in Ghana</p>



<p>If fully implemented nationwide, our country could see:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A dramatic reduction in emergency refusals</li>



<li>Faster treatment for critically ill patients</li>



<li>Improved ambulance efficiency</li>



<li>Better use of existing hospital capacity</li>



<li>Fewer preventable deaths</li>
</ul>



<p>Ending &#8220;no bed syndrome&#8221; is not only possible — it is achievable now, with the right systems in place.</p>



<p>Is Ghana ready for a modern emergency care system? Ghana must decide — now — whether we will continue to accept preventable deaths as routine, or whether we will build an emergency care system worthy of the people it serves.</p>



<p>Thank you. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minority Caucus has criticised what it describes as inconsistencies and policy symbolism within the Mahama administration’s flagship programmes, including the 24-hour economy initiative.</p>



<p>The Caucus argued that while legislation has been introduced, implementation structures remain unclear and incomplete.</p>



<p>According to the statement signed by Frank Annoh-Dompreh, the 24-hour economy “has departed totally from its original vision”. It added: “What has been delivered is not a functional 24-hour economic system, but the creation of an authority without the operational architecture required for shift systems, labour frameworks, industrial coordination, production systems, and delivery mechanisms.”</p>



<p>The Minority also raised concerns about employment data being communicated by government officials.</p>



<p>It pointed to what it described as contradictions between claims of 300,000 jobs and assertions of one million jobs created.</p>



<p>“A government that cannot agree with itself on employment data cannot credibly manage national employment policy,” the statement said, adding that headlines were being prioritised over verified facts.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Caucus argued that flagship initiatives such as the National Apprenticeship Programme and the National Coding Programme were being celebrated at the level of announcements and launches, without sufficient evidence of measurable outcomes.</p>



<p>“Public policy must be measured by impact, not publicity,” the Minority stressed.</p>



<p>The statement concluded that reform without implementation design amounts to “policy symbolism”, warning that legislative announcements without structural backing risk eroding public trust in governance and national transformation efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that President Donald Trump violated federal law when he unilaterally <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-11-05-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imposed sweeping tariffs across the globe</a>, a striking loss for the White House on an issue that has been central to the president’s foreign policy and economic agenda.</p>



<p>The decision is arguably the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/economy/scotus-trump-tariffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most important loss the second Trump</a> administration has sustained at the conservative Supreme Court, which last year repeatedly sided with the president in a series of emergency rulings on immigration, the firing of the leaders of independent agencies and deep cuts to government spending.</p>



<p>Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-1287_4gcj.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote the majority opinion</a> and the court agreed 6-3 that the tariffs exceeded the law.</p>



<p>“The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope,” Roberts wrote for the court. </p>



<p>“In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it.”</p>



<p>The emergency authority Trump attempted to rely on, the court said, “falls short.”</p>

<p>Symphonic Music has announced the release of&nbsp;<em>King of Kings</em>, a symphonic gospel EP now available on all major digital platforms.</p>



<p>The project brings together the grandeur of a full orchestra, the rich harmonies of a choir and the voices of nine gospel artistes, in what organisers describe as a powerful worship experience.</p>



<p>Conceived and produced by Executive Producer, Composer and Conductor&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0">Alfred E. Wiafe Jr.</a>, the EP seeks to present gospel music in a symphonic form. The six-track project blends orchestral arrangements with contemporary gospel vocals.</p>



<p>“Our desire with ‘King of Kings’ was to create an auditory experience that truly exalts the throne of God,” Alfred E. Wiafe Jr. said. “It’s an unveiling of a sound designed to lead listeners into His majestic presence, where every instrument, every voice, and every lyric serves to magnify His name. The throne is exalted. The sound is unveiled.”</p>



<p>The EP features an array of vocal talents, including Charnte Eseyin, Noble G, Manuel Bless, Grace Charles, Joy Somie, Samuel Hutcherson, Rush The High Priest, L.C. Rudolph and Dave da Musicbox.</p>



<p>The collaborative nature of the project is reflected in songs such as the title track&nbsp;<em>King of Kings</em>, which features Charnte Eseyin and Rush The High Priest, and&nbsp;<em>Adonai</em>, featuring Manuel Bless.</p>



<p>A production team led the recording and arrangement process. The team includes Vocal Director Nayaw, Assistant Production Lead and Bassist Prince Sennah, Band Director and Drummer Emmanuel Bludo Jr., Pianists B Sharp and J. Morris, Synthesist Isaac Obiri Siaw, Guitarist Emmanuel Tetteh, Timpani and Stems by Emmanuel Donkoh, and Project Manager Gideon Donkoh.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President John Dramani Mahama has stressed that building a strong steel industry is key to Ghana’s infrastructure ambitions and regional economic leadership. </p>



<p>Speaking at the B5 Plus Ltd steel manufacturing plant commissioning on the value chain of local manufacturing, Mahama said, “We are exporting finished and semi-finished products, not raw scrap.”</p>



<p>He highlighted the government’s Big Push infrastructure programme, which he says is driving investments across multiple sectors. </p>



<p>“Government is investing heavily in roads and highways, railway modernization, bridges and interchanges, energy transmission lines, affordable housing, and industrial parks,” Mahama said.</p>



<p>President Mahama emphasised the critical role of steel in national and continental development. </p>



<p>&#8220;All these I have mentioned require iron and steel,” he noted, adding that “Africa has projected to require over 100 billion annually in infrastructure development,” with West Africa alone facing significant infrastructure deficits.</p>



<p>He argued that a robust domestic steel sector could serve both national and regional needs. “If Ghana develops a strong steel base, we will not only build our own roads and bridges, we will also supply steel to the whole sub-region,” he said.</p>



<p>He described the link between infrastructure and industrial strategy: “This is how infrastructure becomes industrial strategy.”</p>



<p>On energy-intensive industries, he added, “The 24-hour economy program is particularly relevant to energy-intensive industries such as steel manufacturing.” </p>



<p>President Mahama also highlighted his role in strengthening industrial policy, noting, “I had the honor and privilege yesterday to sign the 24-hour Authority bill into law.”</p>



<p>He made it clear that investments in local steel production are central to Ghana’s vision of industrial growth, job creation, and regional leadership in infrastructure supply.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>US President Donald Trump says he will direct US agencies, including the defence department, to &#8220;begin the process of identifying and releasing&#8221; government files on aliens and extraterrestrial life.</p>



<p>Trump made the declaration in a post on Truth Social, after he accused Barack Obama earlier in the day of revealing classified information when the former president said &#8220;aliens are real&#8221; on a podcast last week.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not supposed to be doing that,&#8221; Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding: &#8220;He made a big mistake.&#8221;</p>



<p>Asked if he also thinks aliens are real, Trump answered: &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re real or not.&#8221;</p>



<p>Former US President Obama told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that he thinks aliens are real in an interview released last Saturday.</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re real, but I haven&#8217;t seen them, and they&#8217;re not being kept in Area 51,&#8221; Obama said.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no underground facility unless there&#8217;s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.&#8221;</p>



<p>After the comment made headlines, Obama sought to clarify he thinks it is statistically likely life exists beyond Earth, given the vastness of the universe.</p>



<p>In a follow-up post on Instagram, Obama, who served as US president between 2009-17, clarified: &#8220;I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!&#8221;</p>



<p>Obama&#8217;s initial comments were made during a quickfire &#8220;lightning&#8221; round of questions on the podcast.</p>



<p>There was no indication that Obama relied on classified information when he gave the interview. The BBC has contacted Obama for comment. The Democrat and Trump, a Republican, are longstanding mutual political antagonists.</p>



<p>For his part, Trump said on Thursday on Air Force One that while a lot of people believe in the existence of aliens, he never talks about it, and &#8220;doesn&#8217;t have an opinion on it&#8221;.</p>



<p>Then a few hours later, he posted on Truth Social that &#8220;based on the tremendous interest shown&#8221; he will seek the release of files &#8220;related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters&#8221;.</p>



<p>The US has seen renewed public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life in recent years, sparked in 2017 by reports about a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42379749" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secret Pentagon programme</a> to probe testimony from pilots and other US military members who had reported seeing strange objects in the sky.</p>



<p>In 2022, Congress held <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-61474201" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first hearings on UFOs in 50 years</a> and the Pentagon promised more transparency on the matter &#8211; setting up a dedicated office to collect reports of all military UFO encounters.</p>



<p>The following year, a US House of Representatives <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66320498" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panel</a> on the topic produced no major bombshells nor confirmation of alien life. In a 2024 report, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68515515" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagon said there was &#8220;no evidence&#8221;</a> that the US government had encountered alien life, and that most UFO sightings were just ordinary objects.</p>

<p>Traffic on the Apam Junction–Winneba stretch of the highway has been temporarily halted following an accident involving a fuel tanker at Ekumfi Essarkyir Junction in the Central Region.</p>



<p>The tanker reportedly lost control and overturned, blocking a section of the road.</p>



<p>Personnel from the Apam Fire Station indicated that part of the fuel cargo spilled onto the highway, raising fears of a possible explosion.</p>



<p>Adom News’ Kofi Adjei, who visited the scene, reported that as a precautionary measure, officers from the Ghana National Fire Service and the Police have cordoned off the area and suspended vehicular movement.</p>



<p>Emergency response teams are currently working to transfer the remaining fuel into another tanker to minimise the risk.</p>



<p>Authorities have urged motorists to use alternative routes while efforts continue to clear the scene and restore normal traffic flow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President of the Ghana Union of Traders’ Associations (GUTA), Clement Boateng, has welcomed the signing into law of the 24-Hour Economy bill, describing it as a major boost for the private sector and the wider business community.</p>



<p>Speaking on <strong>Joy News Today</strong> on Friday, February 20, Mr Boateng said the legislation fulfills a key campaign pledge by the National Democratic Congress (NDC) government and signals a new phase in the country’s economic transformation drive.</p>



<p>“I think that we are all aware that this is a major flagship programme announced by the NDC government in their manifesto, and so when they assumed power, everybody was expecting that a major policy of this nature would be implemented as soon as possible,” he stated.</p>



<p>Mr Boateng noted, however, that the policy required careful preparation before it could be rolled out.</p>



<p>“But we should also not forget that for a policy of this nature, there is a lot of work that needs to be done; we have to talk about it, even the framework aspect of it, and then the legal implications,” he said.</p>



<p>According to him, the government took time to address the structural and legal considerations necessary for the smooth implementation of the initiative.</p>



<p>“I think they were doing all these things, and by God’s grace, they have finished, and then the president has also assented to it, so it has paved a way for its implementation,” he added.</p>



<p>Mr Boateng described the President’s assent to the bill as a positive development for businesses across the country.</p>



<p>“I think it’s good news for the private sector as well as the business community in general,” he said.</p>



<p>He expressed optimism that the policy would drive industrialisation and help reposition the economy for sustained growth.</p>



<p>“We think by paving a way for its implementation, it is then going to push the economic transformation and the industrialisation that we all desire as a country,” he noted.</p>



<p>The GUTA president further argued that the introduction of a multi-shift system under the 24-Hour Economy framework would generate sustainable employment opportunities.</p>



<p>“It will also create sustainable employment by introducing the multi-shift system, which is the three-shift system that we all aspire to achieve. It will also enhance productivity and promote economic growth,” he explained.</p>



<p>Mr Boateng added that increased industrial activity would ultimately boost government revenue through job creation and taxation.</p>



<p>“And then when we are able to set up factories as a way of industrialisation it will also enable the government to get more revenue by way of the jobs that it will create and also let the government get its revenue by way of taxes,” he said.</p>



<p>He urged stakeholders, including businesses and policymakers, to support the successful implementation of the policy.</p>



<p>“I think by and large it is good news, and then we all have to help to make sure this 24-Hour Economy is achievable,” Mr Boateng said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Beyond housing supply and regulation, Ghana’s housing crisis is closely linked to the country’s weak transportation system.

This has created excessive pressure on the limited housing stock in urban centres, pushing rent prices to unsustainable levels.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana’s housing problem dates back to the period immediately after independence. The challenge can be traced to the era of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana’s first President, whose government initiated several public housing schemes. Some of these developments, particularly in Tema, are still in use today.</p>



<p>Similarly, during the regime of President I. K. Acheampong, the government introduced the Low-Cost Housing Scheme. These houses can be found across the country, especially in many district capitals, and were intended to make housing affordable for low- and middle-income earners. Despite these efforts, population growth, rapid urbanisation, and limited sustained public investment gradually widened the housing deficit.</p>



<p>In recent times, the housing gap has become so large that government alone can no longer address it. This reality has led to increased private sector participation in the real estate and housing market. To protect tenants, government introduced rent control measures to regulate rent levels and landlord practices, but enforcement has largely been ineffective.</p>



<p>More recently, government introduced a Rent Assistance Programme, under which, through public–private partnerships, loans are provided to citizens to enable them pay rent advances. This intervention was necessitated by the widespread demand by landlords for up to two years’ rent in advance. While the programme has recorded an impressive loan recovery rate of about 99 percent, the number of beneficiaries remains far below the actual demand.</p>



<p><strong>Transportation as a Structural Cause of the Housing Crisis</strong></p>



<p>Beyond housing supply and regulation, Ghana’s housing crisis is closely linked to the country’s weak transportation system. Poor and inefficient transport forces many workers to live close to their workplaces, especially in Accra and other major cities. This has created excessive pressure on the limited housing stock in urban centres, pushing rent prices to unsustainable levels.</p>



<p>To address this structural challenge, government should consider developing a high-speed or bullet train system connecting Accra to the various regional capitals. Such a system would enable workers to live in more affordable locations while commuting efficiently to their places of work. For example, a worker could choose to live in Aflao and still commute daily to ministries and offices in Accra within a reasonable time.</p>



<p>The introduction of a bullet train system would significantly reduce pressure on housing in Accra and other major cities, help stabilise rent prices, and promote balanced regional development.</p>



<p><strong>Funding the Bullet Train Project</strong></p>



<p>The bullet train project can be funded with strong citizen participation, provided government first builds public trust through transparency and accountability. Government must engage the public on how the funds will be administered, establish a dedicated account for the project, and publish annual reports detailing inflows, expenditures, and balances.</p>



<p>The fund must be strictly ring-fenced for the bullet train project. Under no circumstance should the funds be diverted to finance the national budget or any unrelated government activity. Legal safeguards must be put in place to ensure this protection.</p>



<p>A dedicated levy of GH₵1.00 on petroleum products can be introduced to raise sustainable revenue for the project. Given nationwide fuel consumption levels, this levy could generate significant and predictable funds over time.</p>



<p>In addition, the fund can be securitised to raise upfront capital, allowing construction to begin while repayments are made gradually from the dedicated revenue stream.</p>



<p><strong>Administration and Legal Regime</strong></p>



<p>The bullet train system should not be managed directly by government. Instead, it should be operated under a robust Public–Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement. Ghana’s experience with state-managed transport systems such as Metro Mass Transit and Ayalolo buses demonstrates how political interference, abuse of office, and weak governance structures can undermine public investments. These failures must not be repeated. Under this arrangement, management and operations should be insulated from political control, with clear performance benchmarks and accountability mechanisms.</p>



<p>Government’s role should be limited to regulation, oversight, and enforcement of contractual obligations.</p>



<p>The operation and financing of the bullet train must be backed by a dedicated law that prevents abuse, diversion, or amendment of the fund for any other purpose. The only permissible amendment to the law should be the abolition of the petroleum levy once all expenses related to the train have been fully settled. There should be no “emergency” provisions that allow for the use of the funds under any circumstances.</p>



<p>Strong internal control systems must be established, including independent audits, parliamentary oversight, and public disclosure requirements, to prevent misappropriation and misuse of funds.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Ghana’s housing crisis cannot be solved through housing policies alone. It requires integrated planning that links housing, transportation, financing, and governance. A transparently funded, legally protected, and professionally managed bullet train system could transform commuting patterns, ease housing pressure in major cities, and drive long-term national development. The success of such a project will depend not only on infrastructure, but on discipline, accountability, and political restraint.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC), Simon Madjie, has urged investors to take advantage of emerging opportunities within Ghana’s coconut value chain to drive industrial growth, export diversification and environmental sustainability.</p>



<p>He made the call in Accra at the Ghana Tree Crops Investment Summit and Exhibition organised by the Tree Crops Development Authority (TCDA).</p>



<p>The summit, held under the theme “Sustainable Growth through Tree Crop Investment: Resetting and Rebuilding Ghana’s Green Economy,” brought together policymakers, development partners, private sector actors and investors to explore strategies for expanding Ghana’s tree crops industry.</p>



<p>Mr Madjie described coconut as one of the most commercially viable yet underdeveloped crops in Ghana’s agricultural portfolio.</p>



<p>He noted that Ghana is Africa’s leading coconut producer and ranks 13th globally, with annual production exceeding 500,000 metric tonnes, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).</p>



<p>Despite this, he said domestic supply remained insufficient to meet the combined needs of local consumption, industrial processing and export markets.</p>



<p>Citing 2026 data from the International Trade Centre (ITC), Mr Madjie stated that Ghana had an estimated export potential of US$23 million in desiccated coconut, with approximately US$19 million yet to be realised.</p>



<p>He stressed that the coconut value chain offers investment prospects across plantation development, structured outgrower schemes, aggregation, storage, processing and advanced manufacturing.</p>



<p>“The majority of value in the global coconut industry is captured after the farm gate. That is where Ghana is positioning investors to operate,” Mr Madjie said.</p>



<p>He encouraged both domestic and foreign investors to partner with Ghana to build a globally competitive coconut industry that delivers strong commercial returns and employment opportunities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University, Professor Williams Peprah, has expressed worry about the heavy politicisation of the cocoa farming industry.</p>



<p>According to him, the politicisation has made it difficult to see the actual benefit of the industry from policy propositions and implementations.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News in relation to the difficulties facing the cocoa industry, the US-based Finance Professor said commodity prices are very sensitive, thus the government should be mindful of the policy prescription to avoid losing gains.</p>



<p>He proposed the establishment of a Commodity Stabilisation Fund to address funding challenges anytime the industry is facing liquidity issues.</p>



<p>“The world market price, especially commodities like cocoa is highly price sensitive, so whatever decision one will take will always have to remember that the price can go up or down based on the product and market fluctuation. It has already been projected that supply (cocoa beans) was increasing on the market. We should have anticipated that the price would come down”.</p>



<p>“Just after Covid-19, we realise that cocoa price was going up because there was shortage. And if I was part of the team then, I will have strategise that the price will come down and whatever price we are giving to the cocoa farmers we will have factored in another strategy to probably to establish what I may term as a Commodity Stabilization Fund for all the commodities we have &#8211; gold, oil, cocoa – and put a certain percentage in that fund, so that any time there are price fluctuations that fund will be used to support the farmers””, he explained.</p>



<p>He urged policymakers to craft an enhanced strategy to address the numerous challenges in the cocoa industry.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At a press briefing organised held in Accra, Managing Director, Seidu Yonye emphasised that because Ghana’s cocoa purchasing system is "liquidity-intensive and time-sensitive," any delays in funding creates a vacuum.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Amidst concerns of delayed payments, Produce Buying Company (PBC), has appealed to COCOBOD to fast-track payment processes and resolve ‘systematic issues’ that have long plagued the industry.</p>



<p>The appeal comes at a time where concerns have been raised about COCBOD’s ability to ensure timely monetary settlements, coupled with reforms to ensure the restructuring of PBC’s operations, to regain its position as the largest cocoa procurement company in the sector.</p>



<p>At a press briefing organised held in Accra, Managing Director, Seidu Yonye emphasised that because Ghana’s cocoa purchasing system is &#8220;liquidity-intensive and time-sensitive,&#8221; any delays in funding creates a vacuum.</p>



<p>The management of PBC noted that the goal of this appeal is to &#8220;resolve the systematic issues of delayed payments to reduce the incentive for arbitrage and smuggling&#8221;.</p>



<p>To restore financial sanity, PBC is not just asking for speed; they also revealed the establishment of accountable payment systems to aide smooth disbursements.</p>

<p>&#8220;Transparent payment system accessible to COCOBOD and Banks. This architecture will allow stakeholders to track fund drawdowns and utilisation, cocoa deliveries and entitlements as well as real-time arrears.</p>



<p>According to the MD, this &#8220;receivables-based structure will allow banks to finance cocoa purchasing and monitor the supply chain with far greater confidence&#8221;.</p>



<p>Beyond the balance sheets, the MD’s statement focused heavily on farmer security. By streamlining payments, PBC aims to eliminate non-functional buyers who often exploit liquidity gaps to shortchange farmers.</p>

<p>Amoako featured in the Black Princesses Women&#8217;s World Cup qualifiers against South Africa and has been a rock at the back of Ampem Darkoa Ladies&#8217; defence, while Zakaria leads the Ghana Women&#8217;s Premier League top scorers chart after 13 games. </p>



<p>Tay trained with the Black Queens team during their camping in England ahead of their game against the Lionesses, having recovered from a long-term injury. </p>



<p>Sharon Sampson and Alormenu come in to bolster the attack of the Black Queens at the tournament. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear Honourable Education Minister,</p>



<p>I write with a deep sense of urgency and national concern regarding the alarming rise in student delinquency across our Senior High Schools and basic institutions in Ghana.</p>



<p>Recent incidents involving teacher assaults, weapon possession in schools, organised student violence, drug use glorification, sexual exploitation content, and criminal acts by students are no longer isolated disciplinary cases. They represent a systemic breakdown in the moral and behavioural development ecosystem of our children.</p>



<p>Disturbingly, a recurring trend has emerged: in several cases, parents and guardians are seen defending, justifying, or even celebrating acts of indiscipline and violence perpetrated by their wards against teachers, law enforcement, and institutions of authority. This shift signals a dangerous erosion of parental responsibility and societal values.</p>



<p>Global evidence from jurisdictions such as Singapore, the United Kingdom, and parts of the United States shows that effective educational discipline reforms must integrate enforceable parental accountability mechanisms. Where parents are actively bound by law and policy to the behavioural outcomes of their children, rates of juvenile delinquency, school violence, and substance abuse significantly decline.</p>



<p>Honourable, in Ghana, while our educational policies appropriately focus on child protection and discipline, there remains a glaring policy gap: the absence of a structured and enforceable parental responsibility framework for deviant student behaviour.</p>



<p>I respectfully propose the adoption of a “Parental Responsibility and Child Behaviour Accountability Policy (PRCBAP)” under the Ministry of Education in collaboration with the Ghana Education Service, the Ghana Police Service, and the Department of Social Welfare. This framework should include, among other things:<br>1. Mandatory Parenting Accountability Orders for parents of students involved in violent or criminal misconduct.<br>2. Compulsory parenting education and behavioural counselling programmes.<br>3. School–Parent Legal Cooperation Units at district levels.<br>4. Regulation of harmful digital content targeting minors.<br>5. Restorative justice programmes involving both parents and children.<br>6. Civil liability measures for severe acts such as assault, vandalism, andorganisedd school violence.</p>



<p>Honourable Minister, teachers can teach, but they cannot parent. Schools can discipline, but they cannot replace the moral foundation of the home. If immediate policy action is not taken, the long-term implications include, but are not limited to, increased youth criminality, teacher attrition due to unsafe working environments, erosion of respect for authority, national productivity decline and social instability.</p>



<p>Our educational system must not evolve into a crisis management system for failures originating from parental neglect and societal normalisation of deviance. The time has come for Ghana to adopt a firm, restorative, and legally grounded parental accountability policy to safeguard the future of our children and the integrity of our educational institutions.</p>



<p>I humbly urge the Ministry to initiate a national stakeholder dialogue on parental responsibility in child upbringing and student discipline reform. The future of Ghana’s moral and intellectual capital depends on the decisions we make today, Sir.</p>



<p>Respectfully submitted,<br>Al-Hassan Kodwo Baidoo<br>Educational Leadership and Reform Advocate</p>

<p>President John Mahama is scheduled to deliver the 2026 State of the Nation Address on Friday, February 27, in Parliament.</p>



<p>The address is expected to provide a comprehensive overview of the country’s current state, evaluating progress made so far and outlining the government’s key priorities and major policy directions for the year ahead. </p>



<p>The President is anticipated to address critical sectors including the economy, health, education, agriculture, and infrastructure, while also reflecting on Ghana’s international relations and commitments.</p>



<p>The address also serves as a constitutional requirement under Article 67 of the 1992 Constitution, which mandates the President to attend Parliament at the beginning of each session and deliver a message on the state of the nation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Former Commissioner General of the Ghana Boundary Commission (GhBC), Major General Emmanuel Wekem Kotia has provided detailed commentary on Ghana’s decision to escalate its maritime boundary dispute with Togo to international arbitration. </p>



<p>His remarks come after the Ghanaian government formally informed the Togolese authorities of its intention to seek adjudication under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).</p>



<p>The Minister for Government Communications, Felix Kwakye Ofosu, confirmed that Ghana will pursue the delimitation of the offshore boundary under the provisions of UNCLOS, the global legal framework governing the use of the world’s oceans. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href="http://Ghana moves to international arbitration over maritime boundary with Togo">Ghana moves to international arbitration over maritime boundary with Togo</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Speaking on <strong>Joy FM</strong>’s <strong>Midday News</strong> on Friday, Dr Kotia recounted the protracted history of the dispute, noting that efforts by the joint technical committee—a mirror group of Ghanaian and Togolese representatives—had failed to resolve the matter over several years.</p>



<p>“Over the years, the joint technical team have been meeting and they have not been able to resolve it, and the issue was escalated to the level of the two presidents,” he explained. </p>



<p>The dispute escalated in 2016 when Togo refused to recognise the international boundary line with Ghana. In 2017, the presidents of both countries met and agreed that, due to the close bilateral relationship, the matter should be resolved amicably.</p>



<p>As a result, a mirrored joint technical committee was established to negotiate a solution. However, the talks eventually reached a stalemate, prompting the matter to be referred back to the heads of state for further consideration.</p>



<p>Dr Kotia highlighted the strategic importance of the Keta Basin, an area believed to contain substantial untapped natural resources. While part of the basin falls within the disputed area, Ghana has refrained from exploration activities in order to respect ongoing negotiations.</p>



<p>“It is very significant because the Keta Basin, which is yet to be explored and is suspected to have natural resource deposits, is along that lane. Even though part of the disputed area has not affected the entire Keta Basin, because of the negotiations that were ongoing, Ghana decided on its own that there would be no exploration until the dispute is resolved,” he said.</p>



<p>Regarding the arbitration process, Dr Kotia emphasised that both parties must agree on the procedure before the matter proceeds. </p>



<p>He referenced the successful resolution of Ghana’s previous maritime dispute with Côte d’Ivoire as a model for efficiency and fairness.</p>



<p>“Once both sides agree on the process, then whatever the issue will be taken—whether it will be handled by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, like what happened between Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire—it is in that direction that it will happen,” he said.</p>



<p>Dr Kotia added: “With international arbitration, normally it is handled very fast, and we saw what happened with Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. The matter was resolved very well.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Member of Parliament for Assin South Rev John Ntim Fordjour , speaking on Tv3 Ghana on February 17, argued that the absence of a substantive Defence Minister is “problematic” and forms the basis for the Burkina Faso attack on Ghanaian tomato traders.</p>



<p>It is a striking theory.</p>



<p>According to this line of reasoning, the governance of a ministry grinds to a halt the moment the adjective “substantive” goes missing from a title.</p>



<p>National security, it would seem, hinges not on command structures, operational readiness, intelligence capacity or constitutional authority but on typography.</p>



<p>Never mind that there is an active Deputy Minister in office in the person of Brogya Genfi</p>



<p>Never mind that the Ghana Armed Forces have not suspended operations, grounded aircraft, or vacated their posts pending the arrival of a new letterhead.</p>



<p>Never mind that the President, John Dramani Mahama remains constitutionally Commander-in-Chief.</p>



<p>By this logic, a missing ceremonial designation equals institutional paralysis.</p>



<p>One is tempted to imagine the barracks staging a protest: “No substantive minister? We refuse to defend!”</p>



<p>Let us be serious.</p>



<p>Governance is sustained by systems, not stationery. Defence ministries do not function as personality cults revolving around a single embossed business card. They operate through permanent secretaries, military hierarchies, procurement boards, intelligence architecture and Cabinet oversight.</p>



<p>The chain of command does not dissolve because a portfolio has yet to be permanently assigned.</p>



<p>If administrative breakdown were truly the issue, we would be presented with evidence stalled procurement, compromised operations, unpaid troops, a fractured command structure. Instead, the public is offered a dramatic headline: “problematic.”</p>



<p>The leap from a pending appointment to cross-border aggression is not analysis; it is performance. It converts a complex regional security matter into a branding exercise around job titles.</p>



<p>The security architecture of the Republic is layered, professionalized, and constitutionally anchored. It does not hinge on a nameplate. It is not a group project waiting for one student to arrive with a PowerPoint presentation before activity can begin.</p>



<p>Yes, timelines may be debated. Yes, efficiency may be questioned. But to suggest that Ghana’s national defence posture is suspended because a title has not yet been formalized is to confuse symbolism with substance.</p>



<p>And sometimes, the loudest alarms are not sirens, they are microphones searching for volume.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Deputy Spokesperson for the Bawumia Campaign, Dr Ekua Amoakoh, has criticised the government for what she describes as misplaced priorities, questioning why cocoa farmers’ concerns remain unresolved while attention is focused on renaming the National Intelligence Bureau (NIB).</p>



<p>Speaking on the <strong>AM Show</strong> on <strong>Joy News </strong>on Friday, 20 February, Dr Amoakoh said the opposition had a responsibility to amplify the concerns of cocoa farmers who have taken to the streets over unpaid sales.</p>



<p>“Yesterday I saw that some of them took to the streets with placards to demand what is due them. And as the opposition, I do believe that it is our duty to echo those voices and make sure that they are heard,” she said.</p>



<p>She argued that the government’s decision to rename the National Intelligence Bureau to BNI, at a time when farmers are demanding payment, was difficult to justify.</p>



<p>“So in the midst of all of that, when what seems to be the priority of this government is to change the name of NIB to BNI, it is almost laughable,” she stated.</p>



<p>Dr Amoakoh further raised concerns about the governance and accountability implications of the move, suggesting that it could sidestep parliamentary scrutiny.</p>



<p>“And to circumvent Parliament, because NIB is not any institution or just any arm of government. It’s not like the police or the army,” she argued.</p>



<p>“In the police, you go through the ranks. So even though you are appointed by the president, you would have been a police officer for at least 20 years before you get to the point of COP, before you are even considered to be an IG. It is understood that you would have that institutional memory.”</p>



<p>She contrasted that with the appointment of a National Security Coordinator.</p>



<p>“But in this issue of the national security coordinator, I don’t think there’s a criterion for the appointment. It’s whoever the president sees fit. And now we are creating a situation where Parliament does not have that opportunity to question that person.”</p>



<p>Dr Amoakoh acknowledged that the governing party currently has the numbers in Parliament to secure approvals but insisted that public vetting remains important.</p>



<p>“It is true that with the numbers that they have right now in Parliament, they can basically have anybody approved. That is true. But the people of Ghana get an opportunity when there’s a vetting. I’m pretty sure you remember the vetting of the current Deputy Minister of Communication.</p>



<p>“I found that one particularly interesting. He was asked, &#8220;I don’t want to repeat it, but I mean, everybody saw that. &#8221; That is the point of vetting.”</p>



<p>She stressed that parliamentary vetting offers citizens a chance to assess the competence and suitability of public officials.</p>



<p>“We get to, as normal Ghanaians, evaluate the people that are being put in these positions. Even if the situation is that we will not have a say, we get to see, you know, the weight of these people.”</p>



<p>Describing national security as one of the most critical sectors of the country, she questioned the government’s focus at a time when cocoa farmers are struggling.</p>



<p>“So now one of the most critical security positions of this country is the focus on NIB, when the cocoa farmers are hungry. There’s no way you haven’t been able to sit in a room to come up with a way to pay them what you promised them, or even 3,000 cedis.</p>



<p>“That is not the focus of the government. It is changing NIB to be BNI, really?”</p>



<p>Her comments come amid growing agitation among cocoa farmers over delayed payments, alongside an intensifying political debate surrounding the proposed renaming of the National Intelligence Bureau (NIB).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Something calculated is unfolding again. The moment Ghana confronts structural failures inherited from the past, a familiar playbook surfaces. Manufacture urgency. Plant suspicion. Weaponise speculation. Then pin a decades-deep institutional crisis on whoever currently occupies the chair.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/coco.jpg" alt="COCOBOD is not your cover story. It will not be your scapegoat" class="wp-image-10032983128" style="width:840px;height:auto" title="COCOBOD is not your cover story. It will not be your scapegoat"></figure>



<p>This time the target is COCOBOD. More precisely, Randy Abbey.</p>



<p>The script is simple. Rewrite history fast enough and hope the public forgets who built the cracks in the foundation.</p>



<p>But the cocoa sector is not naïve. Farmers know. Licensed buying companies know. Transporters know. Rural communities know. They have lived through every season of this slow erosion.</p>



<p>This crisis did not start in 2025. It did not start with Randy Abbey.</p>



<p>COCOBOD leadership has rotated across governments, each era leaving distinct footprints. Following the exit of John Henry Newman around 2001, the board went through a transitional leadership phase before Isaac Osei’s appointment in 2006 under President Kufuor. Osei presided over strong production growth and cocoa road expansion, even as financing commitments began accumulating and later strained the board’s balance sheet. </p>



<p>Anthony Fofie led from 2008 to 2013 across the close of the Mills administration and the beginning of the Mahama presidency, emphasising price stabilisation and farmer support while borrowing pressures steadily increased. Dr Stephen Kwabena Opuni served from 2013 to 2017 under President Mahama, driving aggressive fertiliser and productivity interventions even as procurement controversies and rising operational costs became entrenched public concerns.</p>



<p> Joseph Boahen Aidoo then served from 2017 to early 2025 under President Akufo-Addo, navigating escalating production volatility linked to illegal mining expansion, disease outbreaks, climate stress, and mounting debt exposure tied to forward sales financing and cocoa road commitments, raising persistent sustainability warnings.</p>



<p>By the time Randy Abbey assumed office in 2025 under President Mahama’s second term, debt exposure, infrastructure liabilities, market volatility, and declining production had already converged into a fragile institutional position.</p>



<p>These pressures span governments. They span parties. They span years.</p>



<p>Debt piled up. Forward sales tightened. Production slipped under the weight of galamsey and climate shocks. Operational costs ballooned. Audit concerns surfaced. Borrowing increased simply to sustain liquidity. None of this is partisan fiction. It is documented history.</p>



<p>To suggest this complexity suddenly materialised because of one CEO is not serious analysis. It is narrative engineering. And the timing is revealing.</p>



<p>Macroeconomic indicators are stabilising. The cedi is regaining footing. Investor sentiment is cautiously improving. National anti corruption conversations are intensifying. Suddenly, panic is manufactured around COCOBOD.</p>



<p>And woven into the hysteria is the recycled fear word haircut, deployed as if repetition alone could trigger old trauma. Ghanaians remember the real haircut of the Ofori Atta debt restructuring era. They remember who presided over that chapter. Today’s miracle narrative is echoed by a desperate choir hoping anxiety will achieve what evidence cannot.</p>



<p>Randy Abbey did not create legacy debt. He did not design the forward sales architecture. He did not initiate controversial procurement regimes. He did not unleash global cocoa price volatility. He inherited a sector already under structural stress.</p>



<p>That does not place him above scrutiny. If there is misconduct, prove it. If there are conflicts of interest, investigate them. If there are irregularities, publish them. Accountability must be evidence driven, not headline driven.</p>



<p>But turning COCOBOD into a political battleground before reform outcomes are visible suggests something deeper. Fear. Fear that genuine structural accountability might begin tracing responsibility backward.</p>



<p>Miracle narratives distort perception. Distorted perception erases history. Ghanaians must reject illusion and demand proof.</p>



<p>COCOBOD is too strategic for theatrical blame games. It funds education. It stabilises foreign exchange. It sustains rural livelihoods. It anchors national agriculture. Turning it into political theatre reveals opposition desperation, not governance concern.</p>



<p>The sector needs discipline, transparency, reform velocity, and mandate clarity. It does not need panic choreography.</p>



<p>If allegations exist, bring documents. If audits exist, publish them. If procurement concerns exist, file them formally, as the Hon. Assafuah petition to CHRAJ and OSP has done. Ghana has institutions. Let evidence, not noise, determine what is true.</p>



<p>Speculation is not oversight. Noise is not reform.</p>



<p>The NPP’s miracle choristers trying to offload historical responsibility onto current leadership may soon realise the public is no longer easily distracted. Citizens now read balance sheets, track commodity cycles, and remember the policy decisions that shaped this moment.</p>



<p>This time the audience is not passive.</p>



<p>This time the record matters.</p>



<p>And this time, Ghana is watching closely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dean of the Faculty of Accounting and Finance at the University of Professional Studies, Accra (UPSA), Prof. Isaac Boadi, has weighed in on the clash over the bill seeking to revert the name of the National Intelligence Bureau (NIB) to the Bureau of National Investigations (BNI).</p>



<p>Speaking on the <strong>AM Show</strong> on <strong>JoyNews</strong> on Friday, February 20, Prof. Boadi questioned the rationale behind the proposed reversal, arguing that repeated rebranding of Ghana’s internal security agency does not address deeper structural and operational challenges.</p>



<p>He expressed frustration over what he described as a cycle of renaming institutions without tackling core institutional weaknesses.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“A change of name — are we not tired of this? I don’t know where we are heading. For security, governance and clarity, these are what matter,” he stated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He recalled how the agency once carried weight and commanded fear.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I grew up knowing one name. When you heard that name, you were shaken. When you got a call from BNI, you would sweat. The name alone disciplined you,” he noted. </p>



<p>And now there is a clash over a bill to revert the name NIB to BNI.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Are we having structural reforms? Will a change of name automatically address the operational practices, the institutional challenges, or public perception? I don’t know,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Prof. Bodi questioned whether legal reforms could not be undertaken without altering the institution’s name.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Can’t we have legal reform without necessarily changing the name of an organisation? Have we done a cost-benefit analysis of this change?” he asked.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He stressed that renaming institutions comes with financial implications, including rebranding, documentation, and administrative adjustments — costs he believes should be carefully evaluated.</p>



<p>Mr Boadi further argued that Ghana faces more pressing national concerns that demand attention, particularly security threats and economic challenges.</p>



<p>Referring to recent security incidents in neighbouring Burkina Faso, he questioned whether enough attention was being paid to implementing action plans to address emerging threats.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We wake up to news of killings. What have we seen in terms of implementation of action plans? What have we done?” he queried.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also highlighted economic pressures facing state institutions and workers, insisting that national priorities must be clearly defined.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We have daily issues that are more important to us. This discussion needs to change. I don’t know where we are going with our priorities,” he emphasised.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Prof. Boadi suggested that if government is intent on renaming public institutions, an independent commission or agency should be established to oversee such changes to ensure consistency, cost-effectiveness, and strategic direction.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“If we want to change a name, it must be properly structured and overseen. It should not just be added to a narrative,” he concluded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Registration is now open for the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (DRIF 2026), a major global meeting on digital rights and inclusion. The event will take place in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, from 14 to 16 April 2026.</p>



<p>DRIF 2026 will be hosted at the Radisson Blu Abidjan Airport Hotel and is expected to bring together hundreds of delegates from around the world. The forum will be bilingual and is the first DRIF event to be held in a Francophone country.</p>



<p>This year’s forum will focus on the theme: “Building Inclusive and Resilient Digital Futures.” The theme responds to fast digital growth, unequal internet access, increased surveillance, shrinking civic space, and reduced funding, especially in the Global South. It builds on the 2025 theme, “Promoting Digital Ubuntu in Approaches to Technology,” which called for cooperation and inclusion in advancing digital rights.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has announced a new plan to better protect the world from dangerous viruses, as deadly disease outbreaks happen more often.</p>



<p>The new five-year plan, called CEPI 3.0, was launched on February 13. CEPI is asking governments, donors, and partners to invest US$2.5 billion to strengthen global disease preparedness.</p>



<p>Speaking at the launch, Chief Executive Officer of CEPI, Richard Hatchett, said the world suffered greatly during COVID-19 because it was not ready.</p>



<p>He said recent outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, Nipah and Marburg show that epidemics and pandemics remain a serious global threat. “Science offers us a solution: by taking decisive action now we can secure a safer future for all,” he stated.</p>



<p>Research cited by CEPI shows that another pandemic like COVID-19 is likely in this generation. Such outbreaks could cost the world more than US$700 billion every year.</p>



<p>CEPI 3.0, which will start in 2027, focuses on fairness and access. A key goal is the 100 Days Mission to develop safe and effective vaccines within 100 days of discovering a new dangerous virus. CEPI says millions of lives could have been saved if COVID-19 vaccines had been ready that fast.</p>



<p>Under the plan, CEPI will support vaccines for known and new diseases, strengthen rapid vaccine production platforms, and build global scientific networks. It also plans to secure 1 to 2 billion vaccine doses through regional manufacturing.</p>



<p>Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention Director-General Dr Jean Kaseya said the partnership with CEPI is helping Africa detect outbreaks early and build vaccine production capacity.</p>



<p>“Our partnership with CEPI helps Africa to strengthen our surveillance capacity so we can detect outbreaks early and to put in place the infrastructure to develop and manufacture safe and effective vaccines that make Africa and the world safer.” </p>



<p>CEPI has already secured US$1.1 billion and is now seeking the remaining US$2.5 billion to fully deliver the plan, in collaboration with partners including the World Health Organization.</p>



<p>CEPI says investing now will save lives, protect economies, and make the world safer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The National Vaccine Institute (NVI) in Ghana has embarked on a two-month survey to gauge public attitudes towards Made-in-Ghana vaccines, aiming to address vaccine hesitancy and misinformation across the country.</p>



<p>The survey, which covers all 16 regions and 55 districts, will gather insights from 11,077 respondents through structured interviews and seven focus group discussions.</p>



<p>A statement signed by Dr. Sodzi Sodzi-Tettey, CEO of NVI, emphasized the importance of public participation in the survey. &#8220;This is not a sales pitch. We genuinely want to listen and understand. The information provided is strictly confidential. Together, we build vaccine confidence that protects every Ghanaian,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The survey seeks to identify drivers of vaccine confidence, examine barriers to acceptance, and map misinformation trends undermining vaccine uptake. According to Dr. Sodzi-Tettey, &#8220;Local vaccines must inspire confidence to succeed. Ghana has long been a leader in immunization in West Africa, built on trust in health workers and vaccines. As we begin manufacturing our own vaccines, we must carry that legacy forward through transparency, engagement, and listening to communities.&#8221;</p>



<p>The survey&#8217;s nationwide coverage is crucial, as vaccine confidence varies significantly across regions. &#8220;Parts of Northern Ghana report higher levels of hesitancy, while urban areas face different misinformation dynamics,&#8221; Dr. Sodzi-Tettey noted.</p>



<p>The NVI appeals to residents in the selected districts to participate in the survey, which runs from February 16 to March 10, 2026. &#8220;The voices of respondents are important. Their feedback, concerns, questions, and experiences will directly shape government communication strategies and ensure that Made-in-Ghana vaccines reach every household,&#8221; Dr. Sodzi-Tettey urged.</p>



<p>The survey&#8217;s findings will inform communication strategies, identify trusted messengers, and guide region-specific vaccine messaging, ultimately supporting Ghana&#8217;s health security transition and building sustained public trust in Made-in-Ghana vaccines.</p>

<p>Cocoa seedlings require a lot of attention. That’s what farm manager Alex recently confirmed when I visited the farm he has nurtured close to Mankessim in the Central Region to introduce the water retainer, a premium soil conditioner. He walked me through the young plants — explaining shade control, watering discipline, soil nutrition and pest management.<br><br>“Sir, if you neglect them at this stage,” he said, “you lose the future harvest.”<br><br>It struck me that cocoa policy is no different from cocoa seedlings.<br><br>It requires careful nurturing.<br><br>Government, led by the Hon. Cassiel Ato Forson, has announced that from the 2026/2027 season, 50% of Ghana’s cocoa beans must be processed locally, alongside reviving PBC and CPC.</p>

<p>On paper, this is bold. Ghana remains the world’s second-largest cocoa producer after Côte d’Ivoire. For decades, we have exported raw beans and imported finished chocolate at a premium.<br><br>Value addition at home is the right ambition.<br><br>But like seedlings, policy must survive real conditions.<br><br>Processing 50% locally works only if three realities align.<br><br>First, processors must buy beans at competitive prices. Otherwise, we may as well just sell the beans to other willing buyers. Yet if they purchase at high domestic prices but sell into competitive global markets, margins shrink and factories struggle. So at what price do we sell the beans to processors? And at what price will we sell the processed cocoa?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="714" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1771517735611-1024x714.jpg" alt="Kofi Asmah Writes: From seedlings to strategy: Can Ghana process 50%?" class="wp-image-10032983139" title="Kofi Asmah Writes: From seedlings to strategy: Can Ghana process 50%?" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1771517735611-1024x714.jpg 1024w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1771517735611-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1771517735611-768x535.jpg 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1771517735611-430x300.jpg 430w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1771517735611-201x140.jpg 201w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1771517735611-150x105.jpg 150w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1771517735611-215x150.jpg 215w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1771517735611-608x424.jpg 608w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1771517735611-330x230.jpg 330w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1771517735611-340x237.jpg 340w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1771517735611-55x38.jpg 55w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1771517735611.jpg 1280w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Second, global buyers must prefer Ghana’s processed cocoa — even if it costs more — over simply buying cheaper raw beans from other producing countries. Nations like Nigeria, Cameroon, Ecuador and Indonesia produce cocoa, in some cases at lower cost. Multinationals optimise for price, logistics and efficiency — not patriotism.<br><br>If it is cheaper for a European or Asian manufacturer to import raw beans elsewhere and process them at home, our processing journey suddenly becomes commercially fragile.<br><br>Third, will the government act as market maker? Will it secure structured offtake agreements for processed cocoa same as it does for the beans? and will it support export marketing and provide working capital guarantees to processors?</p>

<p>Processing is not transformation unless it is profitable and globally competitive.<br><br>Alex’s seedlings reminded me: growth requires consistent care, discipline and market awareness.<br><br>If we nurture this policy with pricing realism, productivity improvements and global market alignment, Ghana will move from beans to bars sustainably and successfully.<br><br>Bold policy is good.<br><br>Sustained competitiveness is even better.</p>
