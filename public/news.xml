										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) Ghana and National Chairman of the General Transport, Petroleum and Chemical Workers Union, Bernard Owusu, has strongly condemned the recent salary reductions imposed on Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) workers.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on&nbsp;<em><strong>Adom FM’s morning show Dwaso Nsem</strong></em>, Mr. Owusu questioned the logic behind making workers bear the brunt of declining global cocoa prices.</p>



<p>“We will not accept salary cuts because of declining world cocoa prices. The COCOBOD worker did not set international cocoa prices. The worker does not control the global market. The worker is not responsible for economic mismanagement. So why must the worker suffer?” he said.</p>



<p>Mr. Owusu stressed the stark income disparity between management and workers.</p>



<p>“When CEOs earn GH₵200,000 a month, and workers earn GH₵10,000–20,000, the gap is clear. Yet in difficult times, it is the worker they want to sacrifice,” he stated.</p>



<p>The TUC chairman also said the cuts appear to violate existing agreements.</p>



<p>“The imposed salary reductions are contrary to our Collective Bargaining Agreement. Salary matters must be negotiated with the recognized unions—not imposed unilaterally. COCOBOD workers are not shock absorbers,” Owusu warned.</p>



<p>He listed the union’s demands, stressing fairness and transparency.</p>



<p>“We demand respect for the CBA, proper union engagement, full transparency, and shared responsibility. An injury to one is an injury to all. Solidarity forever.”</p>



<p>His comments follow COCOBOD’s announcement that Executive Management would take a 20% pay cut, while Senior Staff accepted a 10% reduction for the remainder of the 2025/26 crop year, citing liquidity challenges in the cocoa industry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TUC-ON-COCOBOD-PAY-CUT-1.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>But Mr. Owusu reiterated that workers should not be made to pay for circumstances beyond their control.</p>



<p>“We call on COCOBOD and government authorities to ensure that workers are protected and that their rights under the union agreements are respected,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana&#8217;s emergency care system is at a defining moment. For years, the phrase &#8220;no bed syndrome&#8221; has echoed across the country, symbolising the frustration of families who watch critically ill patients being turned away from multiple hospitals. But the deeper truth is this: the crisis is not simply about the number of beds. It is about how the system functions.</p>



<p>As an emergency physician working on the frontlines, I have seen firsthand that &#8220;no bed syndrome&#8221; is not a shortage problem — it is a coordination problem. It is a flow problem. It is a systems problem.</p>



<p>And systems problems require modern, proactive, system wide solutions.</p>



<p>Ghana now has a clear opportunity to redesign emergency care through practical, affordable, and globally aligned approaches.</p>



<p>The Real Issue: A System Under Strain, not a Lack of Beds or Mattresses.</p>



<p>The public often imagines &#8220;no bed syndrome&#8221; as a physical shortage of beds. The root causes are structural:</p>



<p>There are;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>No unified emergency triage system</li>



<li>No real-time visibility of bed availability</li>



<li>Slow internal patient flow</li>



<li>Weak ambulance-hospital coordination</li>



<li>Lack of accountability for emergency refusals</li>
</ul>



<p>These gaps create delays, diversions, and preventable deaths — even when beds exist. Ending this crisis requires a modern emergency care ecosystem, not just more infrastructure.</p>



<p>A Modern, Proactive Framework for Ending &#8220;No Bed Syndrome&#8221;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>National Emergency Triage &amp; Stabilisation Standards</li>
</ol>



<p>Every emergency patient that reports to a medical facility in Ghana must be:</p>



<p>-I- Assessed immediately, -I- Stabilised, and</p>



<p>-I- Coordinated for transfer if needed, following established national referral pathways. This will replace the outdated practice of refusing patients at the gate.</p>



<p>A unified triage system, adapted from global best practices, ensures that the sickest patients receive urgent care without delay.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Real-Time Bed Visibility Across Hospitals</li>
</ul>



<p>A modern health system cannot operate on guesswork. Accra&#8217;s major hospitals should be digitally interconnected, allowing ambulance teams to know — in real time — where capacity exists.</p>



<p>Ghana needs a simple, scalable bed-visibility system that works in both digital and low-resource settings.</p>



<p>This includes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Structured manual reporting for facilities with limited connectivity</li>



<li>A digital dashboard for larger hospitals</li>



<li>Integration with ambulance dispatch</li>
</ul>



<p>This single reform eliminates unnecessary diversions and saves lives.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Faster Internal Patient Flow</li>
</ul>



<p>Beds are often unavailable at the entry points of major hospitals because patients stay longer than necessary due to slow processes.</p>



<p>Modern flow reforms include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Dedicated Bed Managers</li>



<li>Early discharge planning</li>



<li>Short-stay/observation units</li>



<li>Daily &#8220;flow huddles&#8221; between ED and wards</li>
</ul>



<p>These measures free up beds faster and reduce emergency department congestion.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Strong Ambulance-Hospital Coordination</li>
</ul>



<p>Ambulances must not roam from hospital to hospital. A modern system requires:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Pre-arrival communication</li>



<li>Acceptance-before-arrival rules</li>



<li>Routing guided by real-time bed visibility</li>
</ul>



<p>This protects patients from dangerous delays and ensures ambulances deliver patients to the right facility the first time.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Data, Monitoring &amp; Accountability</li>
</ul>



<p>For the first time, &#8220;no bed&#8221; refusals must become a reportable event. Hospitals should track:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Emergency refusals</li>



<li>ED boarding time</li>



<li>Bed occupancy</li>



<li>Deaths in transit</li>



<li>Ambulance diversions</li>
</ul>



<p>Weekly dashboards and monthly reviews create transparency and drive improvement.</p>



<p>A Smarter, Scalable, Ghana-Ready Solution This modern approach is:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Low-cost</li>



<li>Scalable across all regions</li>



<li>Compatible with both digital and low-resource facilities</li>



<li>Aligned with global emergency care standards</li>
</ul>



<p>It does not require massive new buildings. It requires coordination, visibility, and system design, including continuous monitoring and evaluation.</p>



<p>A New Era for Emergency Care in Ghana</p>



<p>If fully implemented nationwide, our country could see:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A dramatic reduction in emergency refusals</li>



<li>Faster treatment for critically ill patients</li>



<li>Improved ambulance efficiency</li>



<li>Better use of existing hospital capacity</li>



<li>Fewer preventable deaths</li>
</ul>



<p>Ending &#8220;no bed syndrome&#8221; is not only possible — it is achievable now, with the right systems in place.</p>



<p>Is Ghana ready for a modern emergency care system? Ghana must decide — now — whether we will continue to accept preventable deaths as routine, or whether we will build an emergency care system worthy of the people it serves.</p>



<p>Thank you. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that President Donald Trump violated federal law when he unilaterally <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-11-05-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imposed sweeping tariffs across the globe</a>, a striking loss for the White House on an issue that has been central to the president’s foreign policy and economic agenda.</p>



<p>The decision is arguably the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/economy/scotus-trump-tariffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most important loss the second Trump</a> administration has sustained at the conservative Supreme Court, which last year repeatedly sided with the president in a series of emergency rulings on immigration, the firing of the leaders of independent agencies and deep cuts to government spending.</p>



<p>Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-1287_4gcj.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote the majority opinion</a> and the court agreed 6-3 that the tariffs exceeded the law.</p>



<p>“The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope,” Roberts wrote for the court. </p>



<p>“In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it.”</p>



<p>The emergency authority Trump attempted to rely on, the court said, “falls short.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Symphonic Music has announced the release of&nbsp;<em>King of Kings</em>, a symphonic gospel EP now available on all major digital platforms.</p>



<p>The project brings together the grandeur of a full orchestra, the rich harmonies of a choir and the voices of nine gospel artistes, in what organisers describe as a powerful worship experience.</p>



<p>Conceived and produced by Executive Producer, Composer and Conductor&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0">Alfred E. Wiafe Jr.</a>, the EP seeks to present gospel music in a symphonic form. The six-track project blends orchestral arrangements with contemporary gospel vocals.</p>



<p>“Our desire with ‘King of Kings’ was to create an auditory experience that truly exalts the throne of God,” Alfred E. Wiafe Jr. said. “It’s an unveiling of a sound designed to lead listeners into His majestic presence, where every instrument, every voice, and every lyric serves to magnify His name. The throne is exalted. The sound is unveiled.”</p>



<p>The EP features an array of vocal talents, including Charnte Eseyin, Noble G, Manuel Bless, Grace Charles, Joy Somie, Samuel Hutcherson, Rush The High Priest, L.C. Rudolph and Dave da Musicbox.</p>



<p>The collaborative nature of the project is reflected in songs such as the title track&nbsp;<em>King of Kings</em>, which features Charnte Eseyin and Rush The High Priest, and&nbsp;<em>Adonai</em>, featuring Manuel Bless.</p>



<p>A production team led the recording and arrangement process. The team includes Vocal Director Nayaw, Assistant Production Lead and Bassist Prince Sennah, Band Director and Drummer Emmanuel Bludo Jr., Pianists B Sharp and J. Morris, Synthesist Isaac Obiri Siaw, Guitarist Emmanuel Tetteh, Timpani and Stems by Emmanuel Donkoh, and Project Manager Gideon Donkoh.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President John Dramani Mahama has stressed that building a strong steel industry is key to Ghana’s infrastructure ambitions and regional economic leadership. </p>



<p>Speaking at the B5 Plus Ltd steel manufacturing plant commissioning on the value chain of local manufacturing, Mahama said, “We are exporting finished and semi-finished products, not raw scrap.”</p>



<p>He highlighted the government’s Big Push infrastructure programme, which he says is driving investments across multiple sectors. </p>



<p>“Government is investing heavily in roads and highways, railway modernization, bridges and interchanges, energy transmission lines, affordable housing, and industrial parks,” Mahama said.</p>



<p>President Mahama emphasised the critical role of steel in national and continental development. </p>



<p>&#8220;All these I have mentioned require iron and steel,” he noted, adding that “Africa has projected to require over 100 billion annually in infrastructure development,” with West Africa alone facing significant infrastructure deficits.</p>



<p>He argued that a robust domestic steel sector could serve both national and regional needs. “If Ghana develops a strong steel base, we will not only build our own roads and bridges, we will also supply steel to the whole sub-region,” he said.</p>



<p>He described the link between infrastructure and industrial strategy: “This is how infrastructure becomes industrial strategy.”</p>



<p>On energy-intensive industries, he added, “The 24-hour economy program is particularly relevant to energy-intensive industries such as steel manufacturing.” </p>



<p>President Mahama also highlighted his role in strengthening industrial policy, noting, “I had the honor and privilege yesterday to sign the 24-hour Authority bill into law.”</p>



<p>He made it clear that investments in local steel production are central to Ghana’s vision of industrial growth, job creation, and regional leadership in infrastructure supply.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>US President Donald Trump says he will direct US agencies, including the defence department, to &#8220;begin the process of identifying and releasing&#8221; government files on aliens and extraterrestrial life.</p>



<p>Trump made the declaration in a post on Truth Social, after he accused Barack Obama earlier in the day of revealing classified information when the former president said &#8220;aliens are real&#8221; on a podcast last week.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not supposed to be doing that,&#8221; Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding: &#8220;He made a big mistake.&#8221;</p>



<p>Asked if he also thinks aliens are real, Trump answered: &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re real or not.&#8221;</p>



<p>Former US President Obama told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that he thinks aliens are real in an interview released last Saturday.</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re real, but I haven&#8217;t seen them, and they&#8217;re not being kept in Area 51,&#8221; Obama said.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no underground facility unless there&#8217;s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.&#8221;</p>



<p>After the comment made headlines, Obama sought to clarify he thinks it is statistically likely life exists beyond Earth, given the vastness of the universe.</p>



<p>In a follow-up post on Instagram, Obama, who served as US president between 2009-17, clarified: &#8220;I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!&#8221;</p>



<p>Obama&#8217;s initial comments were made during a quickfire &#8220;lightning&#8221; round of questions on the podcast.</p>



<p>There was no indication that Obama relied on classified information when he gave the interview. The BBC has contacted Obama for comment. The Democrat and Trump, a Republican, are longstanding mutual political antagonists.</p>



<p>For his part, Trump said on Thursday on Air Force One that while a lot of people believe in the existence of aliens, he never talks about it, and &#8220;doesn&#8217;t have an opinion on it&#8221;.</p>



<p>Then a few hours later, he posted on Truth Social that &#8220;based on the tremendous interest shown&#8221; he will seek the release of files &#8220;related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters&#8221;.</p>



<p>The US has seen renewed public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life in recent years, sparked in 2017 by reports about a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42379749" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secret Pentagon programme</a> to probe testimony from pilots and other US military members who had reported seeing strange objects in the sky.</p>



<p>In 2022, Congress held <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-61474201" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first hearings on UFOs in 50 years</a> and the Pentagon promised more transparency on the matter &#8211; setting up a dedicated office to collect reports of all military UFO encounters.</p>



<p>The following year, a US House of Representatives <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66320498" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panel</a> on the topic produced no major bombshells nor confirmation of alien life. In a 2024 report, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68515515" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagon said there was &#8220;no evidence&#8221;</a> that the US government had encountered alien life, and that most UFO sightings were just ordinary objects.</p>

<p>Traffic on the Apam Junction–Winneba stretch of the highway has been temporarily halted following an accident involving a fuel tanker at Ekumfi Essarkyir Junction in the Central Region.</p>



<p>The tanker reportedly lost control and overturned, blocking a section of the road.</p>



<p>Personnel from the Apam Fire Station indicated that part of the fuel cargo spilled onto the highway, raising fears of a possible explosion.</p>



<p>Adom News’ Kofi Adjei, who visited the scene, reported that as a precautionary measure, officers from the Ghana National Fire Service and the Police have cordoned off the area and suspended vehicular movement.</p>



<p>Emergency response teams are currently working to transfer the remaining fuel into another tanker to minimise the risk.</p>



<p>Authorities have urged motorists to use alternative routes while efforts continue to clear the scene and restore normal traffic flow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President of the Ghana Union of Traders’ Associations (GUTA), Clement Boateng, has welcomed the signing into law of the 24-Hour Economy bill, describing it as a major boost for the private sector and the wider business community.</p>



<p>Speaking on <strong>Joy News Today</strong> on Friday, February 20, Mr Boateng said the legislation fulfills a key campaign pledge by the National Democratic Congress (NDC) government and signals a new phase in the country’s economic transformation drive.</p>



<p>“I think that we are all aware that this is a major flagship programme announced by the NDC government in their manifesto, and so when they assumed power, everybody was expecting that a major policy of this nature would be implemented as soon as possible,” he stated.</p>



<p>Mr Boateng noted, however, that the policy required careful preparation before it could be rolled out.</p>



<p>“But we should also not forget that for a policy of this nature, there is a lot of work that needs to be done; we have to talk about it, even the framework aspect of it, and then the legal implications,” he said.</p>



<p>According to him, the government took time to address the structural and legal considerations necessary for the smooth implementation of the initiative.</p>



<p>“I think they were doing all these things, and by God’s grace, they have finished, and then the president has also assented to it, so it has paved a way for its implementation,” he added.</p>



<p>Mr Boateng described the President’s assent to the bill as a positive development for businesses across the country.</p>



<p>“I think it’s good news for the private sector as well as the business community in general,” he said.</p>



<p>He expressed optimism that the policy would drive industrialisation and help reposition the economy for sustained growth.</p>



<p>“We think by paving a way for its implementation, it is then going to push the economic transformation and the industrialisation that we all desire as a country,” he noted.</p>



<p>The GUTA president further argued that the introduction of a multi-shift system under the 24-Hour Economy framework would generate sustainable employment opportunities.</p>



<p>“It will also create sustainable employment by introducing the multi-shift system, which is the three-shift system that we all aspire to achieve. It will also enhance productivity and promote economic growth,” he explained.</p>



<p>Mr Boateng added that increased industrial activity would ultimately boost government revenue through job creation and taxation.</p>



<p>“And then when we are able to set up factories as a way of industrialisation it will also enable the government to get more revenue by way of the jobs that it will create and also let the government get its revenue by way of taxes,” he said.</p>



<p>He urged stakeholders, including businesses and policymakers, to support the successful implementation of the policy.</p>



<p>“I think by and large it is good news, and then we all have to help to make sure this 24-Hour Economy is achievable,” Mr Boateng said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Beyond housing supply and regulation, Ghana’s housing crisis is closely linked to the country’s weak transportation system. Poor and inefficient transport forces many workers to live close to their workplaces, especially in Accra and other major cities. This has created excessive pressure on the limited housing stock in urban centres, pushing rent prices to unsustainable levels.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana’s housing problem dates back to the period immediately after independence. The challenge can be traced to the era of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana’s first President, whose government initiated several public housing schemes. Some of these developments, particularly in Tema, are still in use today.</p>



<p>Similarly, during the regime of President I. K. Acheampong, the government introduced the Low-Cost Housing Scheme. These houses can be found across the country, especially in many district capitals, and were intended to make housing affordable for low- and middle-income earners. Despite these efforts, population growth, rapid urbanisation, and limited sustained public investment gradually widened the housing deficit.</p>



<p>In recent times, the housing gap has become so large that government alone can no longer address it. This reality has led to increased private sector participation in the real estate and housing market. To protect tenants, government introduced rent control measures to regulate rent levels and landlord practices, but enforcement has largely been ineffective.</p>



<p>More recently, government introduced a Rent Assistance Programme, under which, through public–private partnerships, loans are provided to citizens to enable them pay rent advances. This intervention was necessitated by the widespread demand by landlords for up to two years’ rent in advance. While the programme has recorded an impressive loan recovery rate of about 99 percent, the number of beneficiaries remains far below the actual demand.</p>



<p><strong>Transportation as a Structural Cause of the Housing Crisis</strong></p>



<p>Beyond housing supply and regulation, Ghana’s housing crisis is closely linked to the country’s weak transportation system. Poor and inefficient transport forces many workers to live close to their workplaces, especially in Accra and other major cities. This has created excessive pressure on the limited housing stock in urban centres, pushing rent prices to unsustainable levels.</p>



<p>To address this structural challenge, government should consider developing a high-speed or bullet train system connecting Accra to the various regional capitals. Such a system would enable workers to live in more affordable locations while commuting efficiently to their places of work. For example, a worker could choose to live in Aflao and still commute daily to ministries and offices in Accra within a reasonable time.</p>



<p>The introduction of a bullet train system would significantly reduce pressure on housing in Accra and other major cities, help stabilise rent prices, and promote balanced regional development.</p>



<p><strong>Funding the Bullet Train Project</strong></p>



<p>The bullet train project can be funded with strong citizen participation, provided government first builds public trust through transparency and accountability. Government must engage the public on how the funds will be administered, establish a dedicated account for the project, and publish annual reports detailing inflows, expenditures, and balances.</p>



<p>The fund must be strictly ring-fenced for the bullet train project. Under no circumstance should the funds be diverted to finance the national budget or any unrelated government activity. Legal safeguards must be put in place to ensure this protection.</p>



<p>A dedicated levy of GH₵1.00 on petroleum products can be introduced to raise sustainable revenue for the project. Given nationwide fuel consumption levels, this levy could generate significant and predictable funds over time.</p>



<p>In addition, the fund can be securitised to raise upfront capital, allowing construction to begin while repayments are made gradually from the dedicated revenue stream.</p>



<p><strong>Administration and Legal Regime</strong></p>



<p>The bullet train system should not be managed directly by government. Instead, it should be operated under a robust Public–Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement. Ghana’s experience with state-managed transport systems such as Metro Mass Transit and Ayalolo buses demonstrates how political interference, abuse of office, and weak governance structures can undermine public investments. These failures must not be repeated. Under this arrangement, management and operations should be insulated from political control, with clear performance benchmarks and accountability mechanisms.</p>



<p>Government’s role should be limited to regulation, oversight, and enforcement of contractual obligations.</p>



<p>The operation and financing of the bullet train must be backed by a dedicated law that prevents abuse, diversion, or amendment of the fund for any other purpose. The only permissible amendment to the law should be the abolition of the petroleum levy once all expenses related to the train have been fully settled. There should be no “emergency” provisions that allow for the use of the funds under any circumstances.</p>



<p>Strong internal control systems must be established, including independent audits, parliamentary oversight, and public disclosure requirements, to prevent misappropriation and misuse of funds.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Ghana’s housing crisis cannot be solved through housing policies alone. It requires integrated planning that links housing, transportation, financing, and governance. A transparently funded, legally protected, and professionally managed bullet train system could transform commuting patterns, ease housing pressure in major cities, and drive long-term national development. The success of such a project will depend not only on infrastructure, but on discipline, accountability, and political restraint.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC), Simon Madjie, has urged investors to take advantage of emerging opportunities within Ghana’s coconut value chain to drive industrial growth, export diversification and environmental sustainability.</p>



<p>He made the call in Accra at the Ghana Tree Crops Investment Summit and Exhibition organised by the Tree Crops Development Authority (TCDA).</p>



<p>The summit, held under the theme “Sustainable Growth through Tree Crop Investment: Resetting and Rebuilding Ghana’s Green Economy,” brought together policymakers, development partners, private sector actors and investors to explore strategies for expanding Ghana’s tree crops industry.</p>



<p>Mr Madjie described coconut as one of the most commercially viable yet underdeveloped crops in Ghana’s agricultural portfolio.</p>



<p>He noted that Ghana is Africa’s leading coconut producer and ranks 13th globally, with annual production exceeding 500,000 metric tonnes, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).</p>



<p>Despite this, he said domestic supply remained insufficient to meet the combined needs of local consumption, industrial processing and export markets.</p>



<p>Citing 2026 data from the International Trade Centre (ITC), Mr Madjie stated that Ghana had an estimated export potential of US$23 million in desiccated coconut, with approximately US$19 million yet to be realised.</p>



<p>He stressed that the coconut value chain offers investment prospects across plantation development, structured outgrower schemes, aggregation, storage, processing and advanced manufacturing.</p>



<p>“The majority of value in the global coconut industry is captured after the farm gate. That is where Ghana is positioning investors to operate,” Mr Madjie said.</p>



<p>He encouraged both domestic and foreign investors to partner with Ghana to build a globally competitive coconut industry that delivers strong commercial returns and employment opportunities.</p>

<p>Black Queens head coach Kim Lars Bjorkegren has handed call-ups to three home-based players in the squad for the Pink Ladies Cup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University, Professor Williams Peprah, has expressed worry about the heavy politicisation of the cocoa farming industry.</p>



<p>According to him, the politicisation has made it difficult to see the actual benefit of the industry from policy propositions and implementations.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News in relation to the difficulties facing the cocoa industry, the US-based Finance Professor said commodity prices are very sensitive, thus the government should be mindful of the policy prescription to avoid losing gains.</p>



<p>He proposed the establishment of a Commodity Stabilisation Fund to address funding challenges anytime the industry is facing liquidity issues.</p>



<p>“The world market price, especially commodities like cocoa is highly price sensitive, so whatever decision one will take will always have to remember that the price can go up or down based on the product and market fluctuation. It has already been projected that supply (cocoa beans) was increasing on the market. We should have anticipated that the price would come down”.</p>



<p>“Just after Covid-19, we realise that cocoa price was going up because there was shortage. And if I was part of the team then, I will have strategise that the price will come down and whatever price we are giving to the cocoa farmers we will have factored in another strategy to probably to establish what I may term as a Commodity Stabilization Fund for all the commodities we have &#8211; gold, oil, cocoa – and put a certain percentage in that fund, so that any time there are price fluctuations that fund will be used to support the farmers””, he explained.</p>



<p>He urged policymakers to craft an enhanced strategy to address the numerous challenges in the cocoa industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Amidst concerns of delayed payments, Produce Buying Company (PBC), has appealed to COCOBOD to fast-track payment processes and resolve ‘systematic issues’ that have long plagued the industry.</p>



<p>The appeal comes at a time where concerns have been raised about COCBOD’s ability to ensure timely monetary settlements, coupled with reforms to ensure the restructuring of PBC’s operations, to regain its position as the largest cocoa procurement company in the sector.</p>



<p>At a press briefing organised held in Accra, Managing Director, Seidu Yonye emphasised that because Ghana’s cocoa purchasing system is &#8220;liquidity-intensive and time-sensitive,&#8221; any delays in funding creates a vacuum.</p>



<p>The management of PBC noted that the goal of this appeal is to &#8220;resolve the systematic issues of delayed payments to reduce the incentive for arbitrage and smuggling&#8221;.</p>



<p>To restore financial sanity, PBC is not just asking for speed; they also revealed the establishment of accountable payment systems to aide smooth disbursements.</p>

<p>&#8220;Transparent payment system accessible to COCOBOD and Banks. This architecture will allow stakeholders to track fund drawdowns and utilisation, cocoa deliveries and entitlements as well as real-time arrears.</p>



<p>According to the MD, this &#8220;receivables-based structure will allow banks to finance cocoa purchasing and monitor the supply chain with far greater confidence&#8221;.</p>



<p>Beyond the balance sheets, the MD’s statement focused heavily on farmer security. By streamlining payments, PBC aims to eliminate non-functional buyers who often exploit liquidity gaps to shortchange farmers.</p>

<p>Kim Lars Bjorkegren has named his Black Queens squad for the upcoming Pink Ladies Cup to be staged in the United Arab Emirates. </p>

<p>Amoako featured in the Black Princesses Women&#8217;s World Cup qualifiers against South Africa and has been a rock at the back of Ampem Darkoa Ladies&#8217; defence, while Zakaria leads the Ghana Women&#8217;s Premier League top scorers chart after 13 games. </p>



<p>Tay trained with the Black Queens team during their camping in England ahead of their game against the Lionesses, having recovered from a long-term injury. </p>



<p>Sharon Sampson and Alormenu come in to bolster the attack of the Black Queens at the tournament. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear Honourable Education Minister,</p>



<p>I write with a deep sense of urgency and national concern regarding the alarming rise in student delinquency across our Senior High Schools and basic institutions in Ghana.</p>



<p>Recent incidents involving teacher assaults, weapon possession in schools, organised student violence, drug use glorification, sexual exploitation content, and criminal acts by students are no longer isolated disciplinary cases. They represent a systemic breakdown in the moral and behavioural development ecosystem of our children.</p>



<p>Disturbingly, a recurring trend has emerged: in several cases, parents and guardians are seen defending, justifying, or even celebrating acts of indiscipline and violence perpetrated by their wards against teachers, law enforcement, and institutions of authority. This shift signals a dangerous erosion of parental responsibility and societal values.</p>



<p>Global evidence from jurisdictions such as Singapore, the United Kingdom, and parts of the United States shows that effective educational discipline reforms must integrate enforceable parental accountability mechanisms. Where parents are actively bound by law and policy to the behavioural outcomes of their children, rates of juvenile delinquency, school violence, and substance abuse significantly decline.</p>



<p>Honourable, in Ghana, while our educational policies appropriately focus on child protection and discipline, there remains a glaring policy gap: the absence of a structured and enforceable parental responsibility framework for deviant student behaviour.</p>



<p>I respectfully propose the adoption of a “Parental Responsibility and Child Behaviour Accountability Policy (PRCBAP)” under the Ministry of Education in collaboration with the Ghana Education Service, the Ghana Police Service, and the Department of Social Welfare. This framework should include, among other things:<br>1. Mandatory Parenting Accountability Orders for parents of students involved in violent or criminal misconduct.<br>2. Compulsory parenting education and behavioural counselling programmes.<br>3. School–Parent Legal Cooperation Units at district levels.<br>4. Regulation of harmful digital content targeting minors.<br>5. Restorative justice programmes involving both parents and children.<br>6. Civil liability measures for severe acts such as assault, vandalism, andorganisedd school violence.</p>



<p>Honourable Minister, teachers can teach, but they cannot parent. Schools can discipline, but they cannot replace the moral foundation of the home. If immediate policy action is not taken, the long-term implications include, but are not limited to, increased youth criminality, teacher attrition due to unsafe working environments, erosion of respect for authority, national productivity decline and social instability.</p>



<p>Our educational system must not evolve into a crisis management system for failures originating from parental neglect and societal normalisation of deviance. The time has come for Ghana to adopt a firm, restorative, and legally grounded parental accountability policy to safeguard the future of our children and the integrity of our educational institutions.</p>



<p>I humbly urge the Ministry to initiate a national stakeholder dialogue on parental responsibility in child upbringing and student discipline reform. The future of Ghana’s moral and intellectual capital depends on the decisions we make today, Sir.</p>



<p>Respectfully submitted,<br>Al-Hassan Kodwo Baidoo<br>Educational Leadership and Reform Advocate</p>

<p>President John Mahama is scheduled to deliver the 2026 State of the Nation Address on Friday, February 27, in Parliament.</p>



<p>The address is expected to provide a comprehensive overview of the country’s current state, evaluating progress made so far and outlining the government’s key priorities and major policy directions for the year ahead. </p>



<p>The President is anticipated to address critical sectors including the economy, health, education, agriculture, and infrastructure, while also reflecting on Ghana’s international relations and commitments.</p>



<p>The address also serves as a constitutional requirement under Article 67 of the 1992 Constitution, which mandates the President to attend Parliament at the beginning of each session and deliver a message on the state of the nation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Former Commissioner General of the Ghana Boundary Commission (GhBC), Major General Emmanuel Wekem Kotia has provided detailed commentary on Ghana’s decision to escalate its maritime boundary dispute with Togo to international arbitration. </p>



<p>His remarks come after the Ghanaian government formally informed the Togolese authorities of its intention to seek adjudication under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).</p>



<p>The Minister for Government Communications, Felix Kwakye Ofosu, confirmed that Ghana will pursue the delimitation of the offshore boundary under the provisions of UNCLOS, the global legal framework governing the use of the world’s oceans. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href="http://Ghana moves to international arbitration over maritime boundary with Togo">Ghana moves to international arbitration over maritime boundary with Togo</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Speaking on <strong>Joy FM</strong>’s <strong>Midday News</strong> on Friday, Dr Kotia recounted the protracted history of the dispute, noting that efforts by the joint technical committee—a mirror group of Ghanaian and Togolese representatives—had failed to resolve the matter over several years.</p>



<p>“Over the years, the joint technical team have been meeting and they have not been able to resolve it, and the issue was escalated to the level of the two presidents,” he explained. </p>



<p>The dispute escalated in 2016 when Togo refused to recognise the international boundary line with Ghana. In 2017, the presidents of both countries met and agreed that, due to the close bilateral relationship, the matter should be resolved amicably.</p>



<p>As a result, a mirrored joint technical committee was established to negotiate a solution. However, the talks eventually reached a stalemate, prompting the matter to be referred back to the heads of state for further consideration.</p>



<p>Dr Kotia highlighted the strategic importance of the Keta Basin, an area believed to contain substantial untapped natural resources. While part of the basin falls within the disputed area, Ghana has refrained from exploration activities in order to respect ongoing negotiations.</p>



<p>“It is very significant because the Keta Basin, which is yet to be explored and is suspected to have natural resource deposits, is along that lane. Even though part of the disputed area has not affected the entire Keta Basin, because of the negotiations that were ongoing, Ghana decided on its own that there would be no exploration until the dispute is resolved,” he said.</p>



<p>Regarding the arbitration process, Dr Kotia emphasised that both parties must agree on the procedure before the matter proceeds. </p>



<p>He referenced the successful resolution of Ghana’s previous maritime dispute with Côte d’Ivoire as a model for efficiency and fairness.</p>



<p>“Once both sides agree on the process, then whatever the issue will be taken—whether it will be handled by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, like what happened between Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire—it is in that direction that it will happen,” he said.</p>



<p>Dr Kotia added: “With international arbitration, normally it is handled very fast, and we saw what happened with Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. The matter was resolved very well.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Member of Parliament for Assin South Rev John Ntim Fordjour , speaking on Tv3 Ghana on February 17, argued that the absence of a substantive Defence Minister is “problematic” and forms the basis for the Burkina Faso attack on Ghanaian tomato traders.</p>



<p>It is a striking theory.</p>



<p>According to this line of reasoning, the governance of a ministry grinds to a halt the moment the adjective “substantive” goes missing from a title.</p>



<p>National security, it would seem, hinges not on command structures, operational readiness, intelligence capacity or constitutional authority but on typography.</p>



<p>Never mind that there is an active Deputy Minister in office in the person of Brogya Genfi</p>



<p>Never mind that the Ghana Armed Forces have not suspended operations, grounded aircraft, or vacated their posts pending the arrival of a new letterhead.</p>



<p>Never mind that the President, John Dramani Mahama remains constitutionally Commander-in-Chief.</p>



<p>By this logic, a missing ceremonial designation equals institutional paralysis.</p>



<p>One is tempted to imagine the barracks staging a protest: “No substantive minister? We refuse to defend!”</p>



<p>Let us be serious.</p>



<p>Governance is sustained by systems, not stationery. Defence ministries do not function as personality cults revolving around a single embossed business card. They operate through permanent secretaries, military hierarchies, procurement boards, intelligence architecture and Cabinet oversight.</p>



<p>The chain of command does not dissolve because a portfolio has yet to be permanently assigned.</p>



<p>If administrative breakdown were truly the issue, we would be presented with evidence stalled procurement, compromised operations, unpaid troops, a fractured command structure. Instead, the public is offered a dramatic headline: “problematic.”</p>



<p>The leap from a pending appointment to cross-border aggression is not analysis; it is performance. It converts a complex regional security matter into a branding exercise around job titles.</p>



<p>The security architecture of the Republic is layered, professionalized, and constitutionally anchored. It does not hinge on a nameplate. It is not a group project waiting for one student to arrive with a PowerPoint presentation before activity can begin.</p>



<p>Yes, timelines may be debated. Yes, efficiency may be questioned. But to suggest that Ghana’s national defence posture is suspended because a title has not yet been formalized is to confuse symbolism with substance.</p>



<p>And sometimes, the loudest alarms are not sirens, they are microphones searching for volume.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Deputy Spokesperson for the Bawumia Campaign, Dr Ekua Amoakoh, has criticised the government for what she describes as misplaced priorities, questioning why cocoa farmers’ concerns remain unresolved while attention is focused on renaming the National Intelligence Bureau (NIB).</p>



<p>Speaking on the <strong>AM Show</strong> on <strong>Joy News </strong>on Friday, 20 February, Dr Amoakoh said the opposition had a responsibility to amplify the concerns of cocoa farmers who have taken to the streets over unpaid sales.</p>



<p>“Yesterday I saw that some of them took to the streets with placards to demand what is due them. And as the opposition, I do believe that it is our duty to echo those voices and make sure that they are heard,” she said.</p>



<p>She argued that the government’s decision to rename the National Intelligence Bureau to BNI, at a time when farmers are demanding payment, was difficult to justify.</p>



<p>“So in the midst of all of that, when what seems to be the priority of this government is to change the name of NIB to BNI, it is almost laughable,” she stated.</p>



<p>Dr Amoakoh further raised concerns about the governance and accountability implications of the move, suggesting that it could sidestep parliamentary scrutiny.</p>



<p>“And to circumvent Parliament, because NIB is not any institution or just any arm of government. It’s not like the police or the army,” she argued.</p>



<p>“In the police, you go through the ranks. So even though you are appointed by the president, you would have been a police officer for at least 20 years before you get to the point of COP, before you are even considered to be an IG. It is understood that you would have that institutional memory.”</p>



<p>She contrasted that with the appointment of a National Security Coordinator.</p>



<p>“But in this issue of the national security coordinator, I don’t think there’s a criterion for the appointment. It’s whoever the president sees fit. And now we are creating a situation where Parliament does not have that opportunity to question that person.”</p>



<p>Dr Amoakoh acknowledged that the governing party currently has the numbers in Parliament to secure approvals but insisted that public vetting remains important.</p>



<p>“It is true that with the numbers that they have right now in Parliament, they can basically have anybody approved. That is true. But the people of Ghana get an opportunity when there’s a vetting. I’m pretty sure you remember the vetting of the current Deputy Minister of Communication.</p>



<p>“I found that one particularly interesting. He was asked, &#8220;I don’t want to repeat it, but I mean, everybody saw that. &#8221; That is the point of vetting.”</p>



<p>She stressed that parliamentary vetting offers citizens a chance to assess the competence and suitability of public officials.</p>



<p>“We get to, as normal Ghanaians, evaluate the people that are being put in these positions. Even if the situation is that we will not have a say, we get to see, you know, the weight of these people.”</p>



<p>Describing national security as one of the most critical sectors of the country, she questioned the government’s focus at a time when cocoa farmers are struggling.</p>



<p>“So now one of the most critical security positions of this country is the focus on NIB, when the cocoa farmers are hungry. There’s no way you haven’t been able to sit in a room to come up with a way to pay them what you promised them, or even 3,000 cedis.</p>



<p>“That is not the focus of the government. It is changing NIB to be BNI, really?”</p>



<p>Her comments come amid growing agitation among cocoa farmers over delayed payments, alongside an intensifying political debate surrounding the proposed renaming of the National Intelligence Bureau (NIB).</p>

<p>Something calculated is unfolding again. The moment Ghana confronts structural failures inherited from the past, a familiar playbook surfaces. Manufacture urgency. Plant suspicion. Weaponise speculation. Then pin a decades-deep institutional crisis on whoever currently occupies the chair.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/coco.jpg" alt="COCOBOD is not your cover story. It will not be your scapegoat" class="wp-image-10032983128" style="width:840px;height:auto" title="COCOBOD is not your cover story. It will not be your scapegoat"></figure>



<p>This time the target is COCOBOD. More precisely, Randy Abbey.</p>



<p>The script is simple. Rewrite history fast enough and hope the public forgets who built the cracks in the foundation.</p>



<p>But the cocoa sector is not naïve. Farmers know. Licensed buying companies know. Transporters know. Rural communities know. They have lived through every season of this slow erosion.</p>



<p>This crisis did not start in 2025. It did not start with Randy Abbey.</p>



<p>COCOBOD leadership has rotated across governments, each era leaving distinct footprints. Following the exit of John Henry Newman around 2001, the board went through a transitional leadership phase before Isaac Osei’s appointment in 2006 under President Kufuor. Osei presided over strong production growth and cocoa road expansion, even as financing commitments began accumulating and later strained the board’s balance sheet. </p>



<p>Anthony Fofie led from 2008 to 2013 across the close of the Mills administration and the beginning of the Mahama presidency, emphasising price stabilisation and farmer support while borrowing pressures steadily increased. Dr Stephen Kwabena Opuni served from 2013 to 2017 under President Mahama, driving aggressive fertiliser and productivity interventions even as procurement controversies and rising operational costs became entrenched public concerns.</p>



<p> Joseph Boahen Aidoo then served from 2017 to early 2025 under President Akufo-Addo, navigating escalating production volatility linked to illegal mining expansion, disease outbreaks, climate stress, and mounting debt exposure tied to forward sales financing and cocoa road commitments, raising persistent sustainability warnings.</p>



<p>By the time Randy Abbey assumed office in 2025 under President Mahama’s second term, debt exposure, infrastructure liabilities, market volatility, and declining production had already converged into a fragile institutional position.</p>



<p>These pressures span governments. They span parties. They span years.</p>



<p>Debt piled up. Forward sales tightened. Production slipped under the weight of galamsey and climate shocks. Operational costs ballooned. Audit concerns surfaced. Borrowing increased simply to sustain liquidity. None of this is partisan fiction. It is documented history.</p>



<p>To suggest this complexity suddenly materialised because of one CEO is not serious analysis. It is narrative engineering. And the timing is revealing.</p>



<p>Macroeconomic indicators are stabilising. The cedi is regaining footing. Investor sentiment is cautiously improving. National anti corruption conversations are intensifying. Suddenly, panic is manufactured around COCOBOD.</p>



<p>And woven into the hysteria is the recycled fear word haircut, deployed as if repetition alone could trigger old trauma. Ghanaians remember the real haircut of the Ofori Atta debt restructuring era. They remember who presided over that chapter. Today’s miracle narrative is echoed by a desperate choir hoping anxiety will achieve what evidence cannot.</p>



<p>Randy Abbey did not create legacy debt. He did not design the forward sales architecture. He did not initiate controversial procurement regimes. He did not unleash global cocoa price volatility. He inherited a sector already under structural stress.</p>



<p>That does not place him above scrutiny. If there is misconduct, prove it. If there are conflicts of interest, investigate them. If there are irregularities, publish them. Accountability must be evidence driven, not headline driven.</p>



<p>But turning COCOBOD into a political battleground before reform outcomes are visible suggests something deeper. Fear. Fear that genuine structural accountability might begin tracing responsibility backward.</p>



<p>Miracle narratives distort perception. Distorted perception erases history. Ghanaians must reject illusion and demand proof.</p>



<p>COCOBOD is too strategic for theatrical blame games. It funds education. It stabilises foreign exchange. It sustains rural livelihoods. It anchors national agriculture. Turning it into political theatre reveals opposition desperation, not governance concern.</p>



<p>The sector needs discipline, transparency, reform velocity, and mandate clarity. It does not need panic choreography.</p>



<p>If allegations exist, bring documents. If audits exist, publish them. If procurement concerns exist, file them formally, as the Hon. Assafuah petition to CHRAJ and OSP has done. Ghana has institutions. Let evidence, not noise, determine what is true.</p>



<p>Speculation is not oversight. Noise is not reform.</p>



<p>The NPP’s miracle choristers trying to offload historical responsibility onto current leadership may soon realise the public is no longer easily distracted. Citizens now read balance sheets, track commodity cycles, and remember the policy decisions that shaped this moment.</p>



<p>This time the audience is not passive.</p>



<p>This time the record matters.</p>



<p>And this time, Ghana is watching closely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dean of the Faculty of Accounting and Finance at the University of Professional Studies, Accra (UPSA), Prof. Isaac Boadi, has weighed in on the clash over the bill seeking to revert the name of the National Intelligence Bureau (NIB) to the Bureau of National Investigations (BNI).</p>



<p>Speaking on the <strong>AM Show</strong> on <strong>JoyNews</strong> on Friday, February 20, Prof. Boadi questioned the rationale behind the proposed reversal, arguing that repeated rebranding of Ghana’s internal security agency does not address deeper structural and operational challenges.</p>



<p>He expressed frustration over what he described as a cycle of renaming institutions without tackling core institutional weaknesses.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“A change of name — are we not tired of this? I don’t know where we are heading. For security, governance and clarity, these are what matter,” he stated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He recalled how the agency once carried weight and commanded fear.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I grew up knowing one name. When you heard that name, you were shaken. When you got a call from BNI, you would sweat. The name alone disciplined you,” he noted. </p>



<p>And now there is a clash over a bill to revert the name NIB to BNI.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Are we having structural reforms? Will a change of name automatically address the operational practices, the institutional challenges, or public perception? I don’t know,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Prof. Bodi questioned whether legal reforms could not be undertaken without altering the institution’s name.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Can’t we have legal reform without necessarily changing the name of an organisation? Have we done a cost-benefit analysis of this change?” he asked.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He stressed that renaming institutions comes with financial implications, including rebranding, documentation, and administrative adjustments — costs he believes should be carefully evaluated.</p>



<p>Mr Boadi further argued that Ghana faces more pressing national concerns that demand attention, particularly security threats and economic challenges.</p>



<p>Referring to recent security incidents in neighbouring Burkina Faso, he questioned whether enough attention was being paid to implementing action plans to address emerging threats.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We wake up to news of killings. What have we seen in terms of implementation of action plans? What have we done?” he queried.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also highlighted economic pressures facing state institutions and workers, insisting that national priorities must be clearly defined.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We have daily issues that are more important to us. This discussion needs to change. I don’t know where we are going with our priorities,” he emphasised.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Prof. Boadi suggested that if government is intent on renaming public institutions, an independent commission or agency should be established to oversee such changes to ensure consistency, cost-effectiveness, and strategic direction.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“If we want to change a name, it must be properly structured and overseen. It should not just be added to a narrative,” he concluded.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Registration is now open for the Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum (DRIF 2026), a major global meeting on digital rights and inclusion. The event will take place in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, from 14 to 16 April 2026.</p>



<p>DRIF 2026 will be hosted at the Radisson Blu Abidjan Airport Hotel and is expected to bring together hundreds of delegates from around the world. The forum will be bilingual and is the first DRIF event to be held in a Francophone country.</p>



<p>This year’s forum will focus on the theme: “Building Inclusive and Resilient Digital Futures.” The theme responds to fast digital growth, unequal internet access, increased surveillance, shrinking civic space, and reduced funding, especially in the Global South. It builds on the 2025 theme, “Promoting Digital Ubuntu in Approaches to Technology,” which called for cooperation and inclusion in advancing digital rights.</p>

<p>The forum is organised by Paradigm Initiative in partnership with Coalition Ivoirienne des Défenseurs des Droits Humains (CIDDH). Sponsors for the 2026 edition include the Ford Foundation, International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Human Rights Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, Mott Foundation, Wellspring Philanthropic Fund, Wikimedia Foundation, and individual supporters.</p>



<p>Formerly known as the Internet Freedom Forum (IFF), the event has been held since 2013. Over the years, it has brought together nearly 3,000 participants from more than 70 countries. The first edition in Nigeria hosted just 53 delegates from 30 countries. In 2019, the forum was renamed DRIF to include digital inclusion issues.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has announced a new plan to better protect the world from dangerous viruses, as deadly disease outbreaks happen more often.</p>



<p>The new five-year plan, called CEPI 3.0, was launched on February 13. CEPI is asking governments, donors, and partners to invest US$2.5 billion to strengthen global disease preparedness.</p>



<p>Speaking at the launch, Chief Executive Officer of CEPI, Richard Hatchett, said the world suffered greatly during COVID-19 because it was not ready.</p>



<p>He said recent outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, Nipah and Marburg show that epidemics and pandemics remain a serious global threat. “Science offers us a solution: by taking decisive action now we can secure a safer future for all,” he stated.</p>



<p>Research cited by CEPI shows that another pandemic like COVID-19 is likely in this generation. Such outbreaks could cost the world more than US$700 billion every year.</p>



<p>CEPI 3.0, which will start in 2027, focuses on fairness and access. A key goal is the 100 Days Mission to develop safe and effective vaccines within 100 days of discovering a new dangerous virus. CEPI says millions of lives could have been saved if COVID-19 vaccines had been ready that fast.</p>



<p>Under the plan, CEPI will support vaccines for known and new diseases, strengthen rapid vaccine production platforms, and build global scientific networks. It also plans to secure 1 to 2 billion vaccine doses through regional manufacturing.</p>



<p>Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention Director-General Dr Jean Kaseya said the partnership with CEPI is helping Africa detect outbreaks early and build vaccine production capacity.</p>



<p>“Our partnership with CEPI helps Africa to strengthen our surveillance capacity so we can detect outbreaks early and to put in place the infrastructure to develop and manufacture safe and effective vaccines that make Africa and the world safer.” </p>



<p>CEPI has already secured US$1.1 billion and is now seeking the remaining US$2.5 billion to fully deliver the plan, in collaboration with partners including the World Health Organization.</p>



<p>CEPI says investing now will save lives, protect economies, and make the world safer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The National Vaccine Institute (NVI) in Ghana has embarked on a two-month survey to gauge public attitudes towards Made-in-Ghana vaccines, aiming to address vaccine hesitancy and misinformation across the country.</p>



<p>The survey, which covers all 16 regions and 55 districts, will gather insights from 11,077 respondents through structured interviews and seven focus group discussions.</p>



<p>A statement signed by Dr. Sodzi Sodzi-Tettey, CEO of NVI, emphasized the importance of public participation in the survey. &#8220;This is not a sales pitch. We genuinely want to listen and understand. The information provided is strictly confidential. Together, we build vaccine confidence that protects every Ghanaian,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The survey seeks to identify drivers of vaccine confidence, examine barriers to acceptance, and map misinformation trends undermining vaccine uptake. According to Dr. Sodzi-Tettey, &#8220;Local vaccines must inspire confidence to succeed. Ghana has long been a leader in immunization in West Africa, built on trust in health workers and vaccines. As we begin manufacturing our own vaccines, we must carry that legacy forward through transparency, engagement, and listening to communities.&#8221;</p>



<p>The survey&#8217;s nationwide coverage is crucial, as vaccine confidence varies significantly across regions. &#8220;Parts of Northern Ghana report higher levels of hesitancy, while urban areas face different misinformation dynamics,&#8221; Dr. Sodzi-Tettey noted.</p>



<p>The NVI appeals to residents in the selected districts to participate in the survey, which runs from February 16 to March 10, 2026. &#8220;The voices of respondents are important. Their feedback, concerns, questions, and experiences will directly shape government communication strategies and ensure that Made-in-Ghana vaccines reach every household,&#8221; Dr. Sodzi-Tettey urged.</p>



<p>The survey&#8217;s findings will inform communication strategies, identify trusted messengers, and guide region-specific vaccine messaging, ultimately supporting Ghana&#8217;s health security transition and building sustained public trust in Made-in-Ghana vaccines.</p>

<p>Cocoa seedlings require a lot of attention. That’s what farm manager Alex recently confirmed when I visited the farm he has nurtured close to Mankessim in the Central Region to introduce the water retainer, a premium soil conditioner. He walked me through the young plants — explaining shade control, watering discipline, soil nutrition and pest management.<br><br>“Sir, if you neglect them at this stage,” he said, “you lose the future harvest.”<br><br>It struck me that cocoa policy is no different from cocoa seedlings.<br><br>It requires careful nurturing.<br><br>Government, led by the Hon. Cassiel Ato Forson, has announced that from the 2026/2027 season, 50% of Ghana’s cocoa beans must be processed locally, alongside reviving PBC and CPC.</p>

<p>On paper, this is bold. Ghana remains the world’s second-largest cocoa producer after Côte d’Ivoire. For decades, we have exported raw beans and imported finished chocolate at a premium.<br><br>Value addition at home is the right ambition.<br><br>But like seedlings, policy must survive real conditions.<br><br>Processing 50% locally works only if three realities align.<br><br>First, processors must buy beans at competitive prices. Otherwise, we may as well just sell the beans to other willing buyers. Yet if they purchase at high domestic prices but sell into competitive global markets, margins shrink and factories struggle. So at what price do we sell the beans to processors? And at what price will we sell the processed cocoa?</p>

<p>Second, global buyers must prefer Ghana’s processed cocoa — even if it costs more — over simply buying cheaper raw beans from other producing countries. Nations like Nigeria, Cameroon, Ecuador and Indonesia produce cocoa, in some cases at lower cost. Multinationals optimise for price, logistics and efficiency — not patriotism.<br><br>If it is cheaper for a European or Asian manufacturer to import raw beans elsewhere and process them at home, our processing journey suddenly becomes commercially fragile.<br><br>Third, will the government act as market maker?

<p>After service at Agape Church one Sunday, my 56-year-old friend Elvis Okudzeto pulled me aside. Sandra stood beside him, Dzifa and Mawuli already heading to his black 2019 Mercedes E-350.<br><br>“Kofi, I bought land from my brother-in-law 12 years ago at Oyarifa. That’s where I’ll build my dream retirement home.”<br><br>I asked gently, “When was the last time you visited it?”<br><br>He paused. “Maybe five years ago.”<br><br>That silence reflects a national reality.<br><br>Many people are not poor.<br><br>They simply have no cash flow.<br><br>We earn. The first major move? We buy land. Some of us even start building — foundation laid, pillars up, maybe roofing done. Then the project stalls. For years. The uncompleted structure stands there, capital locked in cement and iron rods.<br><br>No rent.<br>No income.<br>No liquidity.<br><br>Meanwhile, life happens — school fees, emergencies, business opportunities. Without steady cash flow, we make pressured decisions. We borrow at high rates. We sell assets cheaply. We postpone smarter investments.<br><br>It is rarely poverty.<br><br>It is frozen capital.<br><br>If land or an uncompleted building is not generating income, it is immobilized wealth. Speculators will say the price of the land will increase in value and can be hopefully resold for a fortune. Sometimes that works if you secure the land and hopefully, development comes to the area.<br><br>But Hope is not a strategy.<br><br>Cash flow is.<br><br>Around the world, countries facing housing shortages have turned to container developments as practical solutions. Shipping containers have been converted into student housing, micro-apartments, retail units and community spaces. They are faster to deploy, modular and income-producing.<br><br>Imagine placing a few modern style container studios on that Oyarifa land, adding culturally aesthetic elements that elevate your development into a tourist site and renting them out with Air BnB. Make eclectic YouTube videos promoting your new tourist haven and a steady stream of tourists will make it their favorite destination!<br><br>Imagine converting part of your uncompleted building into a modest open-air event space for weekend programs. Even the ground floor of an uncompleted building can generate rent while upper floors wait. Maybe start your fresh juice business in one of the rooms on the ground floor.<br><br>The land begins to breathe.<br><br>Cash flow gives you options. It strengthens your negotiating power. It brings peace.<br><br>This way, even if you buy in hope that land values will increase so you can make a windfall from the sale, you can earn an income as the land values rise!<br><br>I have seen too many people become land-rich and cash-poor.<br><br>Your story must be different.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When President Yoweri Museveni first emerged on the African stage in the 1980s, Western capitals and many on the continent hailed him as part of a new breed of leaders. Like Paul Kagame in Rwanda, Meles Zenawi in Ethiopia, and Isaias Afwerki in Eritrea, Museveni was a soldier who had fought to dislodge chaotic, violent regimes and who spoke the language of liberation, reconstruction, and stability. He carried with him the aura of a man who had fought for national rebirth. In fact, the regime that he had fought for close to five years had nicknamed him a bandit and likened him to the former English legendary outlaw Robin Hood, who stole from the rich to reward the poor.</p>



<p>That image, carefully cultivated in interviews, books, and public appearances, rested on real credentials. Museveni cut his teeth in the liberation politics of East Africa. As a student at the University of Dar es Salaam in the 1960s, he moved in circles with the then Tanzanian President, Julius Nyerere, and other pan-Africans. Tanzania at the time was a sanctuary for liberation movements from across the continent. He trained alongside Frente de Liberacao de Mocambique (Frelimo) fighters in Mozambique, organised exile groups in Tanzania, and wrote about the continent’s ailments, among them the corrosive tendency of leaders to overstay their welcome. In his autobiography, Sowing the Mustard Seed: The Struggle for Freedom and Democracy in Uganda, and public speeches, he framed himself as a break with the past: not “mere a change of guards but a fundamental change.”</p>



<p>And yet, four decades after he strode into Kampala’s parliament building in 1986, promising a new order, Uganda is a different country from the one many expected. The trajectory that once seemed plausible: liberation to liberal rule to accountable government, has been interrupted and, in many respects, inverted. The man who once warned against “overstaying in power” has presided over favourable constitutional amendments, political manoeuvres, and a security posture that have consolidated his hold on the state and curtailed fundamental freedoms. The question now confronting observers at home and abroad is a blunt one: how did the liberator become the entrenched strongman?</p>



<p><strong>A revolution born of war</strong></p>



<p>Museveni’s route to power was forged in violence and exile, a context that helps explain both his initial credibility and some of the traits that followed. In the early 1970s, he assembled and trained guerrilla forces, repeatedly testing the boundaries of regional politics. His early incursions against Idi Amin’s Uganda were costly and chaotic: poorly supplied and sometimes disastrously executed, they left trails of reprisals and civilian suffering. Even then, regional diplomacy and Nyerere’s backing created space for exile fighters to regroup and rearm.</p>



<p>When Amin’s rule collapsed in 1979, the patchwork of exile organisations, including Museveni’s Front for National Salvation (FRONASA), was folded into the broader Uganda National Liberation Army. Museveni served briefly as a minister of defence in the post‑Amin administration, but it was his later guerrilla outfit, the National Resistance Army (NRA) and its campaigns in the early 1980s that established the credentials that many romanticised: a victorious rebel movement that marched on Kampala and declared a new political beginning in 1986.</p>



<p><strong>Promises and the politics of permanence</strong></p>



<p>Museveni’s rhetoric in those early years, invoking Nyerere, pan‑African solidarity, and a moral obligation to rebuild, resonated powerfully. He criticised the very habit of prolonged personal rule that he had later practised. His book, “What is Africa’s Problem (Speeches and Writings on Africa),” and speeches spoke of democratic renewal and the dangers of entrenched leadership. Yet, over the course of his presidency, the formal institutions and norms that protect political competition and civil liberty have been steadily weakened.</p>



<p>The mechanisms of that transformation are both legal and coercive. The much-cherished 1995 Constitution and the presidential five-year term limits were amended. Opposition politicians have faced detention; rivals have been sidelined, intimidated, or disappeared. Press freedom and civic space have been eroded by laws, harassment, and a security apparatus that increasingly interprets dissent as a security threat. In private conversations recounted by former allies, and sometimes in public remarks that initially sounded ambiguous, Museveni signalled an intolerance of contestation: the idea that alternatives would be hard to find, and that politics ought to be managed rather than allowed to run free.</p>



<p>There are multiple dynamics at work. One is the logic of revolutionary movements turned states: leaders who fought for liberation often come to see the revolutionary project as indivisible from their personal leadership. Another is the role of patronage and security networks. Family members and loyalists, most visibly his brother, long‑time military figure General Caleb Akanwanaho, who is largely known by his nom de guerre Salim Saleh, occupy positions that help anchor the regime. Over decades in which survival felt precarious, and with multiple domestic and regional threats, a politics of consolidation became rationalised as necessary for stability.</p>



<p>But rationales of stability can be self‑reinforcing. As institutions weaken and opposition is squeezed, the space to refresh leadership, to hold rulers to account, or to introduce new ideas dwindles. Promises about preventing “overstaying” calcify into a defence of continued rule. What was at first framed as a revolution for the people risks becoming a revolution for the leadership.</p>



<p><strong>The costs for Uganda</strong></p>



<p>For ordinary Ugandans, the consequences are tangible. Curtailment of free expression and the press makes it harder to expose corruption, to mobilise social demands, or to contest flawed policies. Opposition leaders, when permitted to campaign at all, do so under the shadow of legal restrictions and security harassment. Civil society finds its manoeuvring room narrowed. International partners that once celebrated Museveni’s stability are now forced into awkward calculations: whether to prioritise security and cooperation or to insist on rights and democratic principles.</p>



<p>Museveni’s story is not unique. Across Africa and beyond, the arc from guerrilla leader to long‑serving president has been repeated: what began as liberation can harden into a monopoly. But that does not make it inevitable. The evolution depends on choices, choices to defend institutions, to tolerate dissent, and to allow leadership to be renewed peacefully.</p>



<p><strong>A question of legacy</strong></p>



<p>Museveni’s record is mixed. Under his rule, Uganda has seen periods of relative order, infrastructure projects, and a foreign policy that kept the country engaged in regional affairs. Yet those accomplishments sit alongside an expanding executive, shrinking civic freedoms, and a political culture that makes succession and renewal fraught.</p>



<p>For a man who once sounded the alarm about leaders who cling to power, the final judgement will be measured by how his tenure is remembered: as a liberation that delivered genuine institutions and opportunities for successive generations, or as a revolution that became so entwined with one ruler’s hold on the state that it precluded the very pluralism he once championed.</p>



<p>The man who once penned critiques of life presidents, who spoke of &#8220;fundamental change,&#8221; has become the very archetype he condemned. The principles articulated to Nyerere and in his early writings— accountability, democratic transition, service to the people— appear abandoned. Instead, Museveni presides over a system marked by patronage, militarised politics, and the suppression of dissent. The &#8220;fundamental change&#8221; promised in 1986 now looks, in hindsight, like the foundation for a dynastic project built on permanence.</p>



<p>Uganda’s tragedy is not merely one of a leader grown old in office, but of a revolutionary ideal profoundly betrayed. Museveni’s journey from liberator to long-reigning autocrat stands as a stark lesson in how the mantle of revolution can cloak an enduring hunger for power, leaving the aspirations of a nation and the principles once held sacred as casualties along the way. The question haunting Uganda now is not about Museveni&#8217;s past victories, but about the legacy of a liberation that ultimately imprisoned its own people.</p>



<p>Ugandans, and observers across Africa, are left to weigh the bittersweet irony. The shepherd who promised to lead his people out of chaos presided, over time, over a consolidation of power so thorough that it has left many asking whether the liberation was for the many or for the few. The contest over that legacy is not finished.</p>

<p>Ghanaian musician <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0">Samini</a> has responded to complaints by some Ghanaians over the growing influence of foreign music in the local market.</p>



<p>According to him, the trend should rather inspire artistes to work harder and expand beyond their borders.</p>



<p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1">Doreen Andoh</a>&nbsp;on the Cosmopolitan Mix on&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=2">Joy FM</a>, Samini said he believes crossing borders with music is not a bad thing but an opportunity for growth and global exposure.</p>



<p>“I look at Africa as a united group of people. So Nigerian music or Ghanaian music is African music to me. Music from North America and music from South America is music from in that case if I want my music to blow in certain territories I shouldn’t have a problem when someone else’s music is blowing in other territories.</p>



<p>“What I have to do is to look at the blueprint they are using that is helping them to go beyond their borders and be heard everywhere, so that I can apply that to what I am doing,” he said.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Samini has released his eighth studio album titled&nbsp;<em>ORIGIN8A</em>, which features musicians such as&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=3">Stonebwoy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=4">Kofi Kinaata</a>,&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=5">Kuami Eugene</a>,&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=6">Kaakie</a>,&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=7">Soweto Gospel Choir</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=8">M.anifest</a>.</p>



<p>The award-winning musician said he is hopeful the album will earn him recognition at the&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=9">Telecel Ghana Music Awards</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President of the Students Representative Council (SRC) at the Ghana School of Law, Nana Opoku Ware, is investing in the legal education pursuit of students at the school after donating GH₵50,000 to the school’s Financial Aid Fund.</p>



<p>This donation follows the recent launch of the &#8220;GSL-SRC Scholarship Scheme &#8217;26&#8221; to ease financial burden on some students of the school.</p>



<p>Beyond the personal contribution, Nana Opoku Ware’s administration has achieved a milestone in the historic inclusion of law students in the Student Loan Trust Fund (SLTF).</p>



<p>By combining systemic reform with direct financial support, the President is creating a robust safety net that expands the reach of financial aid, ensuring that students without adequate financial resources are no longer left behind in their pursuit of legal education in Ghana.</p>



<p>&#8220;The law should not be a luxury for the wealthy, but a calling for the brilliant. This unprecedented contribution is a direct call to action for other resourceful students and stakeholders to invest in the future of the legal profession,” Nana Opoku Ware said.</p>



<p>The donation would serve as an alternative avenue for students to seek financial aid if they are unsuccessful with the student trust fund and other scholarship schemes.</p>



<p>“By bridging the gap for those whose applications were not successfully processed at the SLTF, the donation ensures that financial hardship does not silence the voices of the most brilliant aspiring lawyers,” he said.</p>



<p>The benevolence reinforced a life-long commitment to philanthropy that began with paying fees of his colleagues in his college era and provision of borehole projects in Ejisu.</p>



<p>In March, 2024, Nana Opoku Ware espoused the same generosity and compassion towards his colleague students in KNUST, when he paid school fees of some 27 needy students.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Jasikan Circuit Court has remanded a 50-year-old driver and a 25-year-old Nigerian national on counts of conspiracy and trafficking of narcotics. </p>



<p>The convicts pleaded not guilty to the counts and were remanded into police custody to reappear on March 5, 2026. </p>



<p>Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), Seth-Vincent Kpodo, prosecuting, told the Court presided over by Mr Lambert Y. Kerigah, that the complainants were Police Officers stationed at the Jasikan District Police Command. </p>



<p>He said convicts; Justice Nelson Amlado, aged 50, was a driver and resident of Kpando in the Volta region, while Olayele Yussuf, aged 25, is a Nigerian national from Oyo State but had no permanent place of abode in Ghana. </p>



<p>He said on February 13, 2026, the District Command had intelligence that a certain cargo truck would be travelling from Hohoe through Likpe and Jasikan enroute to Nkwanta between February 13 and February 15, 2026. </p>



<p>DSP Kpodo said surveillance was then mounted on the said route. On February 15, at about 0400 hours, the team intercepted a Benz cargo truck with registration number GS 3831-09, driven by Amlado, with Yussuf as an occupant, at Bodada. </p>



<p>He said the initial search disclosed an empty cargo; however, a thorough inspection revealed a newly constructed inner compartment. </p>



<p>DSP Kpodo said the truck was brought to the Jasikan police station, where a local welder was engaged to cut open the compartment in the presence of the convict,s where a total of 1,482 compressed parcels of substances suspected to be Indian hemp were found concealed in the truck. </p>



<p>He said the convicts were subsequently arrested and the exhibits were retained for investigation, adding that on February 16, all the parcels were transported to the Oti Regional Office of NACOB, Jasikan and tested in the presence of the convicts and other witnesses. </p>



<p>DSP Kpodo said a test report submitted proved that the substances tested positive for the presence of Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), proving that the substances were indeed narcotics. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Officials of Ghana Water Limited (GWL) have uncovered an illegal water connection at a mineral water production facility in the Klagon area near Tema. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Officials of Ghana Water Limited (GWL) have uncovered an illegal water connection at a mineral water production facility in the Klagon area near Tema. </p>



<p>The discovery was made by one of 10 special anti-non-revenue water task teams recently inaugurated by the company’s management.</p>



<p>The teams have been established following internal assessments, which revealed that approximately 52 percent of treated water produced by GWL cannot be accounted for, resulting in significant revenue losses that affect operations and service delivery.</p>



<p>The exercise forms part of intensified efforts to curb non-revenue water losses across the country.<br></p>



<p>Speaking to journalists at the site, the Tema Regional Communications Manager of GWL, Sampson Ampah, explained that the inspection led to the detection of a sophisticated and concealed illegal connection allegedly carried out at the mineral water factory.</p>



<p>Mr Ampah explained that a 16-inch main distribution pipeline, which runs directly in front of the factory, had been tapped into illegally using a two-inch pipeline.</p>



<p>“The pipe was buried underground and routed behind a wall, passing through a nearby sugarcane farm before entering the factory premises.</p>



<p>The connection was deliberately hidden to make detection extremely difficult,” Mr Ampa said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He added that within the factory, the illegal line was disguised with valves to give the impression that it was inactive. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Investigations</h2>



<p>However, further technical investigations by the task force confirmed that the line was actively supplying water directly to the factory’s production operations.</p>



<p>&#8220;Notably, there was no water meter installed, meaning the facility had been using water without payment,&#8221; Mr Ampa said</p>



<p>He described the act as a clear criminal offence, stressing that illegal connections deprive the company of critical revenue needed to sustain operations.</p>



<p>The Regional Manager stated that proceeds from water sales were used to purchase treatment chemicals, pay electricity bills, maintain infrastructure, and fund future expansion projects aimed at improving access to potable water.</p>



<p>Mr Ampah said that suspects connected to the illegal activity would be arrested and handed over to the police for further investigation and prosecution if found&nbsp;culpable.</p>



<p>He appealed to the general public to support the fight against illegal water connections by reporting suspicious activities to Ghana Water Limited’s district or regional offices, or to the nearest police station.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Narcotics Control Commission (NACOC) has&nbsp;identified&nbsp;marijuana and tramadol as the most abused drugs among the youth in the Western North Region.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Principal Narcotics Control Officer, Western North Region, Mr Dennis&nbsp;Adutwum-Gyimah, expressed concern over the increasing usage of these substances&nbsp;and&nbsp;emphasised NACOC’s objective to ensure public health and safety through control, prevention, and eradication of narcotic drug trafficking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with the Ghana News Agency,&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Adutwum-Gyimah&nbsp;stated that NACOC&nbsp;was&nbsp;collaborating with security agencies to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;hotspots and conduct mass education on drug demand reduction in public places, including radio stations, churches, and educational institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our focus is on public health and safety, and we’re working tirelessly to reduce the menace,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He&nbsp;advised the youth to&nbsp;stay away from drugs, citing the associated social vices, and urged traditional authorities to support NACOC’s efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The commission has intensified its awareness campaigns, targeting schools, communities, and public gatherings to educate people about the dangers of drug abuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr Adutwum-Gyimah also cautioned drug peddlers that dealing in drugs was unlawful and warned that perpetrators would be made to face the full rigours of the law. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>British police were searching the former mansion of King Charles&#8217; younger brother <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/mountbatten-windsors-arrest-marks-new-low-disgraced-british-royal-2026-02-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor</a> on Friday after a photograph of the royal emerging from a police station was splashed on newspapers around the world.</p>



<p>Mountbatten-Windsor <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-police-arrive-home-king-charles-brother-andrew-telegraph-reports-2026-02-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was arrested</a> on Thursday, his 66th birthday, on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government documents to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein when he was a trade envoy.</p>



<p>The former prince was released under investigation after being held by police for more than 10 hours. He has not been charged with any offence but looked haunted in a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/how-reuters-captured-photo-former-prince-andrew-leaving-custody-2026-02-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters photograph</a> after his release, slumped in the back of a Range Rover, eyes red and with a look of disbelief on his face.</p>



<p>The photograph of a man who was once a dashing naval officer and reputed favourite son of the late Queen Elizabeth was carried on the front page of newspapers in Britain and around the world, accompanied by headlines such as &#8220;Downfall&#8221;.</p>



<p>The first 15 pages of Friday&#8217;s Daily Mail were dedicated to the story, while Charles&#8217; demand that &#8220;the law must take its course&#8221; was the headline of five British newspapers. News of the arrest also dominated the front pages of other newspapers around the world, including Australia, where Charles is head of state, Europe and the United States.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">KING SAYS THE LAW MUST TAKE ITS COURSE</h2>



<p>Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who took his own life in 2019, and said he regrets their friendship. But the release of millions of documents by the U.S. government showed he had remained friends with Epstein long after the financier was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.</p>



<p>Those files suggested Mountbatten-Windsor had forwarded to Epstein British <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/where-king-charles-brother-andrew-shows-up-epstein-files-2026-02-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government reports</a> about investment opportunities in Afghanistan and assessments of Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited as the government&#8217;s Special Representative for Trade and Investment.</p>



<p>The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times. The last member of the royal family to be arrested in Britain was Charles I, who was beheaded in 1649 after being found guilty of treason.</p>



<p>King Charles, who stripped his brother of his title of prince and forced him out of his Windsor home last year, said on Thursday he had learned about the arrest with &#8220;deepest concern&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,&#8221; the king said. &#8220;What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities.&#8221;</p>



<p>The news broke early on Thursday morning that six unmarked police cars and around eight plain-clothed officers had arrived at Wood Farm on the king&#8217;s Sandringham estate in Norfolk, eastern England, where Mountbatten-Windsor now resides.</p>



<p>Thames Valley Police officers also searched the mansion on the king&#8217;s Windsor estate west of London where Mountbatten-Windsor had lived before being forced out amid anger at the Epstein revelations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">POLICE SEARCHES AT WINDSOR CONTINUE</h2>



<p>Officers said late on Thursday that Mountbatten-Windsor had been released under investigation. They said the searches at Sandringham had concluded but the searches in Windsor were continuing.</p>



<p>While being arrested means that police have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and that the royal is suspected of involvement in an offence, it does not imply guilt.</p>



<p>A conviction for misconduct in a public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and cases must be dealt with in a Crown Court, which handle the most serious criminal offences.</p>



<p>Thames Valley&#8217;s Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement on Thursday that officers had now opened a full investigation into the offence of misconduct in public office.</p>



<p>Any investigation could take months as the police will likely have to work with the British government, and its embassies around the world, along with Buckingham Palace to establish what records remain.</p>



<p>The misconduct investigation is not the only accusation against Mountbatten-Windsor into which police are looking.</p>



<p>Anti-monarchy campaign group Republic has reported him over allegations he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to Britain for sex in 2010. Thames Valley Police said it was assessing allegations that a woman had been taken to an address in Windsor, where the former prince lived until recently.</p>



<p>In 2022, the king&#8217;s brother settled a civil lawsuit brought in the United States by the late Virginia Giuffre who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager at properties owned by Epstein or his associates.</p>



<p>Mountbatten-Windsor has denied ever meeting Giuffre.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Academic City University has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the American University of Antigua College of Medicine (AUA) to expand opportunities for Ghanaian students seeking careers in medicine.</p>



<p>The American University of Antigua College of Medicine (AUA) is an innovative medical school dedicated to providing a learner-centric education of the highest quality, granting opportunities to underrepresented minorities, fostering a diverse academic community, and ensuring that its graduates develop the skills and attitudes of lifelong learning, compassion, and professionalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The agreement between Academic City and AUA aims to strengthen academic collaboration between the two institutions and to create clear pathways for students to access medical education and training abroad.</p>



<p>Under the partnership, graduates of Academic City University who meet the required admission criteria will be granted guaranteed admission into AUA’s Doctor of Medicine (MD) programme. Beneficiaries will also enjoy a waiver of the application fee, an expedited admissions process and a waiver of the pre-registration seat deposit upon acceptance.</p>



<p>The collaboration further provides financial support to help reduce the cost of medical education. Eligible Academic City graduates admitted into the MD programme will qualify for a $5,000 Preferred Programme Grant, to be paid in instalments during the pre-clinical phase of the programme. AUA is expected to award up to 15 such grants annually across its three academic intakes.</p>



<p>In addition to the grant, students may be considered for other scholarships and awards, including those that promote diversity within the medical profession.</p>



<p>Commenting on the agreement, the Vice-President for Institutional Advancement at Academic City University, Dr Lucy Agyepong, said the partnership would deepen international academic cooperation and open up more opportunities for students to contribute meaningfully to the health sector in Ghana and beyond.</p>



<p>She added that the agreement also encourages academic exchange through the sharing of faculty expertise, research opportunities and learning resources.</p>



<p>“At Academic City University, we remain committed to providing student-centred education and strengthening pathways for students to pursue professional careers in healthcare,” she added.</p>



<p>AUA President, Dr Peter Bell, stated that “American University of Antigua is looking forward to welcoming students from Academic City University, Ghana, to our program. </p>



<p>The collaboration between both institutions will provide qualified students with the opportunity to become physicians well prepared to provide care to diverse patient populations in a global setting.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cadillac’s arrival on the Formula 1 grid in 2026 marks one of the most significant moments for American manufacturers in modern Grand Prix racing. You will also have <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">the opportunity to <a href="https://1xbet.sl/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">win your online sports bets</a> at 1xBet based on the performances of this squad</span>.</p>



<p>Backed by General Motors (GM) and operated in partnership with TWG Motorsports, the Cadillac F1 Team will become the sport’s 11th team. This ends a long and politically complex entry process that began under the Andretti banner and evolved into a full Cadillac-branded project. If you enjoy Formula 1, then you will definitely want to win with your online sports betting made on it at the 1xBet website.</p>



<p>Formula 1 and the FIA officially approved Cadillac’s entry in March 2025, confirming that the team met 3 kinds of requirements:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>sporting;</li>



<li>financial;</li>



<li>and technical.</li>
</ul>



<p>The project is headquartered in the United Kingdom under the name Cadillac Formula Racing, which now serves as the operational hub after the Andretti name was phased out from the F1 effort. Veteran F1 executive Graeme Lowdon was appointed team principal, while Dan Towriss, CEO of TWG Motorsports, plays a central leadership role.</p>



<p>Partnering with Ferrari<strong></strong></p>



<p>For its debut, Cadillac will use Ferrari-supplied power units, a common strategy for new teams to ensure reliability and competitiveness while building long-term infrastructure. A <a href="https://1xbet.sl/en/line/football" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simple bet on football</a> and on Formula 1 is definitely best made at the 1xBet platform.</p>



<p>GM’s long-term ambition, however, is to become a full works team by developing its own Cadillac-branded power unit in the coming years through TWG GM Performance Power Units. This aligns with Formula 1’s new 2026 technical regulations, which place greater emphasis on electrical power and sustainable fuels. A bet on football, Formula 1 or many other disciplines can be made in a simple manner at 1xBet, which you can join today.</p>



<p>Getting ready for the great occasion<strong></strong></p>



<p>Cadillac has also made headlines with a high-profile Super Bowl campaign in early 2026, unveiling its car livery and signalling its intent to connect with a broader U.S. audience. The team is set to debut at the Australian Grand Prix in March 2026. While waiting for other F1 Grand Prix events, you can also <a href="https://1xbet.sl/en/slots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play profitable online slots</a> with 1xBet.</p>



<p>They will enter a highly competitive field, but with significant financial backing and technical recruitment from across the paddock. The initial driver lineup includes experienced race winners Sergio Pérez and Valtteri Bottas, underlining Cadillac’s desire to be competitive from the outset rather than simply making up the numbers. Some profitable online slots are available to play at 1xBet before a major Formula 1 event.</p>

<p>The year 2025 will be remembered as one of the strongest periods for Ghanaian equities in recent history. </p>



<p>The Ghana Stock Exchange Composite Index returned 79.4%, powered by broad-based gains across listed companies and renewed investor confidence in equities amid easing inflation and stabilising interest rates. </p>

<p>Yet within this exceptional market environment, performance dispersion still mattered. While the tide lifted many boats, only a few strategies demonstrated the discipline and adaptability required to consistently translate market momentum into investor outcomes. Among them was the InvestCorp Active Equity Fund (IAEF), which delivered a 78% return in 2025, placing it among the best-performing equity funds in the market. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="816" height="1024" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-816x1024.png" alt=" The InvestCorp Active Equity Fund " class="wp-image-10032983078" title=" The InvestCorp Active Equity Fund " srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-816x1024.png 816w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-239x300.png 239w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-768x964.png 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-112x140.png 112w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-100x125.png 100w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-199x250.png 199w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-120x150.png 120w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-338x424.png 338w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-40x50.png 40w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961.png 1020w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" /></figure>



<p><strong>A Disciplined Approach in a Strong Market&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>IAEF’s performance was not due to passive market exposure. Managed by InvestCorp Asset Management Limited, a wholly Ghanaian-owned investment firm, the Fund follows a research-driven, active investment philosophy that responds to changing market conditions rather than a passive approach. </p>



<p>Established in <strong>February 2019 </strong>and regulated by the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>, the Fund provides investors with exposure to both <strong>domestic and international equities</strong>, with the flexibility to allocate <strong>up to 40% of assets to foreign stocks</strong>. This structure allows the portfolio to benefit from local market strength while diversifying risk through selective global opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although equity-focused, the Fund retains the ability to allocate modestly to fixed-income instruments for liquidity management and short-term risk mitigation — a feature that proved valuable during periods of market rotation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Performance That Built Confidence&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The Fund’s <strong>78% return in 2025 </strong>built on an already strong <strong>35% performance in 2024</strong>, reinforcing a pattern of consistent execution rather than a one-off outcome. Importantly, performance over the year was <strong>steady</strong>, reflecting disciplined portfolio construction and active rebalancing across both local and global holdings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For investors who remained invested throughout the year, the <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong>cumulative return by December was 78%</strong></span>, highlighting the benefits of patience and long-term positioning during a favourable equity cycle. </p>



<p><strong>Standing Out Among Peers&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>While the broader equity market delivered strong <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">returns, IAEF’s performance <strong>outpaced most peers</strong></span>, reflecting its ability to generate alpha through active management. Rather than relying solely on market momentum, the Fund’s strategy emphasised stock selection, timing, and diversification — factors that contributed meaningfully to relative performance during the year. </p>

<p><strong>Positioning for the Year Ahead&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Looking toward <strong>2026</strong>, the investment landscape is expected to remain supportive of equities. <strong>Fixed income yields remain low</strong>, encouraging continued reallocation toward risk assets, while <strong>easing inflation and stable interest rates </strong>provide a constructive backdrop for corporate earnings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Against this backdrop, IAEF is positioned to pursue opportunities across both the <strong>Ghanaian equity market and selected global exposures</strong>, including U.S. equities. This dual-market approach allows the Fund to participate in domestic growth while tapping into resilient global sectors, enhancing diversification and strengthening long-term return potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Case for IAEF&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The experience of 2025 reinforced a fundamental investment lesson: <strong>strong markets reward participation, but exceptional outcomes require judgment</strong>. The InvestCorp Active Equity Fund’s performance and growth over the past year illustrate what disciplined active management can achieve when combined with diversification, risk awareness, and execution. </p>



<p>As investors assess opportunities for the year ahead, strategies that remain flexible, research-led, and globally aware are likely to remain well-positioned in an increasingly complex investment environment. </p>



<p><strong><em>NB: Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dean of the Faculty of Accounting and Finance at the University of Professional Studies, Accra (UPSA), Prof Isaac Boadi, has called for a shift from political sloganeering to practical economic implementation, insisting that “good economics or a good economy begins where slogans end”.</p>



<p>Speaking on JoyNews’ AM Show on Friday, 20 February, he questioned what he described as a growing reliance on catchy policy labels without clearly defined implementation frameworks.</p>



<p>“I think we should be tired of slogans as a country. A policy you want to legislate — you want to legislate night work without pricing the night — is it not a problem?” he asked.</p>



<p>Referring to the recently assented 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill, 2025, Prof Boadi argued that policy proposals must be supported by thorough financial planning.</p>



<p>“You want to legislate night work, but then you find it difficult to price that night. Check the entire document well; there is Build 24, Grow 24, Show 24, Connect 24, and many others,” he said.</p>



<p>While acknowledging that the ambition behind such initiatives may be commendable, he maintained that the focus must move beyond branding.</p>



<p>“As a good economy begins where slogans end, we should be tired of this nomenclature and start the implementation properly,” he stated.</p>



<p>Prof Boadi also raised concerns about the financial viability of the programme, particularly reports that it would require $4 billion over the next five years.</p>



<p>“You want to do a programme; now we have been told they need $4 billion for the next five years. Do we have the money now?” he questioned.</p>



<p>“I am only asking questions because of one policy. Look at the nomenclatures given over the period; now we have decided to add a ‘plus’ to it. It started before the election period; we were all laughing in the country: ‘nkoko nkitikiti’, 24-hour economy, and all those names.”</p>



<p>He cautioned that attaching popular labels to policy initiatives without clear funding sources and timelines could create implementation challenges.</p>



<p>“When you add that to a policy, you have a problem from the implementation phase. I will be happy on any day that this materialises, because you are not targeting only employment but productivity, which is key,” he noted.</p>



<p>Prof Boadi stressed that policies aimed at addressing youth unemployment and boosting productivity would naturally attract public support — but only if they are grounded in realism.</p>



<p>“Look at the youth in our country; when you want to come out with a policy that will address the needs of the ordinary Ghanaian, why won’t we be happy? But the point is that the dreamer should be able to have timelines and the cost plan available,” he said.</p>



<p>“You tell me you need $4 billion; where is the source of the funds? Where is it going to come from? We have shifted several goalposts; now we have left the policy. It’s going to be driven by the ordinary person; the government will provide the platform for you, and now you will come in and fill the gap. From the beginning, that was not the concept that we knew; it has changed.”</p>



<p>His comments come after President John Dramani Mahama formally assented to the 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill, 2025, on Thursday, during a brief ceremony ahead of the 13th Cabinet meeting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President of the Ghana Football Association (GFA), Kurt Okraku, has expressed concern over the injury crisis in the Black Stars team ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. </p>



<p>Otto Addo&#8217;s side has been hit with injuries to key members of the team, with the tournament a few months away. </p>



<p>Mohammed Salisu has been ruled out of the global showpiece after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACL), while Abu Francis, Mohammed Kudus and a few others are on the treatment table at their various clubs.</p>



<p>Anxiety amongst Ghanaian fans continues to grow regarding the situation, and Kurt is no different to those sentiments.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m concerned, and everybody is concerned about the number of players in the medical room as you speak now. But I’m very positive. I’m a very positive person,&#8221; he said in an interview with the GFA Media team.</p>



<p>&#8220;I always believe that everything and anything is possible, and our job is to work as much as we can. Our job is to pray as much as we can for the Almighty God to bless us, and we leave the rest to him.</p>



<p>&#8220;We’ll do our part, and we know that our part will be enough to make Ghana proud.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Black Stars are expected to commence their preparations for the World Cup next month when they face Austria and Germany in two high-profile friendly games.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Exactly two weeks from today, Ghana will be celebrating the 69th anniversary of its independence from Great Britain in 1957. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Exactly two weeks from today, Ghana will be celebrating the 69th anniversary of its independence from Great Britain in 1957. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But Ghana’s independence story goes much further back than 1957. &nbsp;It started in 1951, specifically, on 20th February, when Kwame Nkrumah’s Convention People’s Party (CPP) swept into power under “limited self-government,” having won 34 of the 38 seats in the general election in a complex political arrangement that also seated many independents as well as representatives from various groups in the Legislative Assembly. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Today marks the 75th anniversary of that momentous occasion, which eventually resulted in full independence in 1957, accelerating or triggering other independence movements across Africa. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Nkrumah became the “leader of government business,” a dubious title that belittled the significance of the moment and had to be replaced, after much protest by the CPP, with the more fitting title of “prime minister” in 1952.</p>



<p>With an additional portfolio of Minister of Development, he began the Herculean task of transforming an economy hollowed by centuries of external exploitation and primed for liberation and reconstruction.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Achievements</h2>



<p>Thus began the prelude to Ghana’s full independence, a period characterised by some of the greatest achievements of Nkrumah in his 15 years in office (from 1951 to 1966), achievements that tend to get overshadowed by stories of independence that begin from 1957. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, a recent report on human capital development policies in Ghana started with educational policies after 1957, but the bigger story of education under Nkrumah in fact began in 1952, with his Accelerated Education Programme.</p>



<p>This programme made primary education free for the first time in the Gold Coast, to be followed by the Education Act of 1961, which made primary education compulsory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it wasn’t just access to education that increased; there was a boom in education infrastructure at all levels as well, among the most notable being Opoku Ware Secondary School (in collaboration with the Catholic Church) and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, which for decades had the only Olympic-size swimming pool in Ghana. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The famous Akosa Primary School at Suntreso, in Kumasi, was named after the father of the now-world-renowned pathologist, Prof Agyemang Badu Akosa, who was a CPP commissioner at Sekyere District in Ashanti.</p>



<p>The Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (or Gee, named after the contractors who built it) was also constructed in Kumasi in 1954, as was the Ashanti Regional Library at Bantama.</p>



<p>These and other major accomplishments in Ashanti disprove the charge later hurled against Nkrumah by his adversaries that he had squandered the cocoa wealth from Ashanti on other parts of the country to the neglect of Ashanti.</p>



<p>Indeed, Ashanti saw its fastest socio-economic development at any time during the tenure of Nkrumah, becoming a major beneficiary of the 600 factories that Nkrumah built across the country.</p>



<p>As a result of this record, Nkrumah also drew strong political support from Ashanti, with the CPP winning eight seats (compared to the National Liberation Movement’s 12) in the 1956 election, and sweeping 43 per cent of the total vote, despite a wave of violence against its supporters in the lead-up to the election.</p>



<p>The year 1952 also saw the first local government council elections, where the CPP won nearly 90 per cent of the 270 seats, laying the groundwork for the popular participation that would propel it to a massive victory again in the 1956 election that brought full independence to Ghana the following year, with the CPP sweeping 71 out of 104 seats.  </p>



<p>While much has been written about Nkrumah’s Seven-Year Development Plan (1963-1970), very little is known of his first (five-year) development plan (1951 to 1956), during which the implementation of the ambitious Volta River Scheme, for example, led to the construction of Tema Township and the Tema Harbour; the Akosombo dam; the Volta Lake (the largest man-made lake in the world), and the Adomi Bridge, the first suspension bridge in the Gold Coast, whose construction began in 1955.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Big dreams &nbsp;</h2>



<p>To power his ambitious programme of rapid industrialisation and economic transformation, Nkrumah also restructured the Industrial Development Corporation in 1955 from a small-loans-disbursing outfit hurriedly set up in the dying days of colonialism into a more proactive one with a mandate that included “the investigation, formulation and carrying out of projects for developing industries in the Gold Coast.”</p>



<p>Particular attention was paid to “industries which will make use of local materials”. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There were many challenges, of course.</p>



<p>Land disputes were, as they are now, a major obstacle to development, particularly the establishment of new industries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This forced Nkrumah to propose “industrial estates” for “all firms which seek new premises or the use of public services,” according to the Industrial Development Committee Reports and Accounts of 1954-5.</p>



<p>The 1966 coup undid much of the success of the initiative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Equally crucial at the time was the shortage of business capital and the skills in both the public and private sectors to drive industrialisation, leading Nkrumah in 1954 to issue a policy statement welcoming foreign direct investment on condition that it brought with it new and better ways for manufacturing (knowledge and technology transfer) as well as the training of Africans for technical and managerial positions.</p>



<p>These particular challenges eventually led to the establishment in 1961 of the Institute of Public Administration (known today as the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration, GIMPA) and, three years later, the National Productivity Institute (known today as the Management Development and Productivity Institute) under the National Planning Commission.</p>



<p>The first institute was to build the capacity of the public sector, while the second one aimed at boosting efficiency in the productive sector, including state-owned enterprises.</p>



<p>It was the beginning of a productivity revolution, a precondition for raising the living standards of Ghanaians, which defined the legacy of Nkrumah until his tragic overthrow.  </p>



<p>The story of Ghana’s independence is meaningless unless it is linked to the total realisation of what happened before 1957.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dean of the Faculty of Accounting and Finance at the University of Professional Studies, Accra, Prof Isaac Boadi, says the government’s 24-Hour Economy policy could significantly boost Ghana’s productivity and attract investment — but only if it is properly implemented.</p>



<p>Speaking on JoyNews’ AM Show on 20 February, Prof Boadi described the signing of the 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill by President John Dramani Mahama on Thursday as “symbolically powerful”.</p>



<p>He said the move sends a strong signal to investors beyond Ghana’s borders that the country is serious about expanding economic activity and creating opportunities.</p>



<p>“The signing yesterday had an investor signalling. Beyond our borders, those investors who heard this yesterday will be preparing by now what is going to happen in this country,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Boadi noted that the policy targets sectors such as manufacturing, agribusiness, agro-processing, health, retail, transportation and hospitality. He explained that these sectors depend heavily on time-sensitive operations, where efficiency and continuous activity are critical.</p>



<p>According to him, Ghana is currently operating below its productive capacity, with many institutions and services closing early or functioning below full potential. He argued that initiatives such as the 24-Hour Economy are essential to expanding output, creating jobs and addressing youth unemployment.</p>



<p>However, he cautioned that legislation alone will not deliver meaningful economic transformation.</p>



<p>“Economic transformation is not produced by legislation alone. It’s produced by incentives, infrastructure and institutions,” he stressed.</p>



<p>He warned that without proper planning, funding and execution, even well-intentioned policies could fail.</p>



<p>Prof Boadi also raised concerns about financing, noting that the government has indicated it would require $4 billion over the next five years to implement the programme.</p>



<p>“You want to do a programme… do you have the money now?” he asked, emphasising that financial readiness is critical to turning policy into tangible results.</p>



<p>The academic further observed that the original concept of the 24-Hour Economy appears to have evolved. Initially presented as government-driven, he said it now seems to rely more heavily on private sector participation, with the government providing a platform for businesses to fill gaps. He cautioned that such shifts could create uncertainty and undermine confidence in the policy.</p>



<p>Prof Boadi also questioned claims that some public institutions are already operating on a 24-hour basis, describing these as routine shift systems rather than full implementation of the policy.</p>



<p>“When you go to DVLA or the passport office, and they say they are operating a 24-hour economy, under which law?” he asked, adding that practical considerations — including pricing and staffing for night operations — must be clearly addressed.</p>



<p>Despite his reservations, Prof Boadi said he would welcome the initiative if it succeeds in boosting productivity and tackling youth unemployment.</p>



<p>“I would be happy any day this materialises,” he said, urging the government to move beyond slogans such as “Grow 24”, “Make 24” and “Build 24”, and focus on execution.</p>



<p>He reiterated that for the 24-Hour Economy to deliver real impact, legislation must be complemented by incentives, infrastructure investment and strong institutions to ensure long-term sustainability.</p>



<p>“Good economics begins where slogans end,” he added.</p>



<p>The 24-Hour Economy remains one of the government’s flagship strategies, aimed at increasing productivity, expanding exports and creating employment. Its success, however, will depend on effective implementation, adequate funding and robust institutional support to ensure the benefits reach ordinary Ghanaians and attract both local and international investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana’s insurance industry has reaffirmed its readiness to fully underwrite marine and aviation cargo risks as government moves to strictly enforce compulsory domestic marine cargo insurance for all commercial imports effective February 1, 2026.</p>



<p>The assurance comes from Mercy Naa Koshie Boampong, Chief Executive Officer of Serene Insurance and Second Vice-President and Chairperson of the Ghana Insurers Association (GIA).</p>



<p>Mrs Boampong firmly rejected suggestions that local insurers lack the technical expertise or financial strength to handle large-scale marine cargo risks. She described marine cargo insurance as a well-established and mature line of business within Ghana’s insurance market, not a new product being introduced solely because of enforcement.</p>



<p>“Marine cargo insurance has existed in Ghana for decades. The industry has the structures, underwriting capacity and systems required to manage complex and high-value risks,” she stated.</p>



<p>Strong Capital Base and Global Reinsurance Support</p>



<p>According to Mrs Boampong, Ghanaian insurers operate with solid capital bases and experienced underwriting teams, supported by structured access to international reinsurance markets.</p>



<p>She emphasised that every marine risk underwritten locally is backed by reinsurance arrangements that distribute exposure across global partners. Through reinsurance and retrocession mechanisms, local insurers are able to share high-value risks internationally, ensuring that claims can be settled without financial strain.</p>



<p>“Every risk underwritten locally is supported by reinsurance. This global risk-sharing framework guarantees additional security for importers and the economy,” she said.</p>



<p>Enforcement to Retain Premiums in Ghana</p>



<p>The renewed enforcement is being implemented under Section 222 of the Insurance Act, 2021 (Act 1061), in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, Bank of Ghana, National Insurance Commission (NIC) and Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA).</p>



<p>Although the legal requirement for domestic marine cargo insurance has existed since 2006, compliance has been limited. Data from the NIC indicate that only about six percent of Ghana’s imports are currently insured locally. Industry estimates suggest that nearly US$100 million in marine insurance premiums is paid annually to foreign insurers.</p>



<p>Mrs Boampong noted that Ghana’s insurance sector currently has significant unused underwriting capacity due to continued offshore placement of cargo insurance.</p>



<p>“With effective enforcement, this existing capacity can now be fully utilised to protect Ghanaian importers while retaining premium income within the local economy,” she said.</p>



<p>Significant Economic Impact</p>



<p>The potential economic impact is substantial. In 2024, Ghana processed approximately 13.7 million metric tonnes of cargo through its ports, with total merchandise imports valued at about US$15.2 billion. These imports including petroleum products, grains, edible oils, frozen foods and heavy machinery—require comprehensive marine cargo coverage.</p>



<p>Daniel F. Yeboah, Head of Insurance and Pensions at the Ministry of Finance, has indicated that full implementation of the policy could generate nearly GH₵300 million annually for the domestic insurance industry.</p>



<p>Industry analysts believe consistent enforcement could strengthen capital accumulation within the insurance sector, deepen underwriting expertise and enhance linkages between insurance and trade finance.</p>



<p>Industry Ready for Full Implementation</p>



<p>Mrs Boampong maintained that Ghana’s insurers are fully prepared to assume the responsibility.</p>



<p>“The Ghanaian insurance industry is ready. Serene Insurance is ready. The financial backing, technical competence and international partnerships are already in place,” she affirmed.</p>



<p>With enforcement set to take effect, stakeholders view the policy as a critical step toward safeguarding Ghana’s import trade, strengthening domestic financial institutions and retaining significant insurance premiums within the national economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Several countries which have signed up to Donald Trump&#8217;s Board of Peace have contributed more than $7bn (£5.2bn) towards a Gaza &#8220;relief package&#8221;, the US president has said.</p>



<p>Trump made the announcement during the first meeting of the organisation that many of US&#8217;s Western allies have refused to join, fearing the body originally meant to help end the war between Israel and Hamas may be intended to replace the UN.</p>



<p>The second phase of a US-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan includes the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza.</p>



<p>It &#8220;looks like&#8221; Hamas would disarm, Trump told participants. However, there are few signs of the Palestinian group disarming. Gazans say it is extending its control over the Strip.</p>



<p>Speaking as the Board of Peace convened on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had &#8220;agreed with our ally the US there will be no reconstruction of Gaza before the demilitarisation of Gaza&#8221;.</p>



<p>The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed, and 251 others were taken hostage.</p>



<p>Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 72,000 people have been killed, according to the territory&#8217;s Hamas-run health ministry.</p>



<p>The enclave&#8217;s economy is in ruins, with its buildings and infrastructure largely destroyed. The UN estimates the cost of damage at $70bn.</p>



<p>Countries including the UK, Canada, France and Germany have refused to join the Board of Peace that came into being last month.</p>



<p>In an effort to address concerns that the organisation was meant as a way of sidelining the UN, Trump told the board&#8217;s first meeting in Washington that &#8220;we&#8217;re going to be working with the United Nations very closely, we&#8217;re going to bring them back&#8221;.</p>



<p>Gaza, the US president said, was &#8220;no longer a hotbed of radicalism and terror&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;And to end that, we have today, and I&#8217;m pleased to announce that Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait have all contributed more than $7bn toward the relief package&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every dollar spent is an investment in stability,&#8221; he said, adding that the UN would contribute $2bn for humanitarian assistance, while football body Fifa would raise $75m for soccer-related projects in the Strip.</p>



<p>Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician who has been given the title of high representative for Gaza as part of the board, said the process of recruiting a new transitional Palestinian police force had begun and &#8220;just in the first few hours we have 2,000 people who have applied&#8221;.</p>



<p>But both Israel and the US have insisted that the force is not drawn from the existing Hamas-controlled police without stringent vetting, nor do they want it simply made up of the security forces of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.</p>



<p>That means starting from scratch, and the task is daunting.</p>



<p>Mladenov has previously said the Palestinian police force must be the primary security agency in Gaza, assisted by the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), and not vice-versa.</p>



<p>According to the US plan, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas.</p>



<p>But there is little evidence such a force could yet oversee the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian factions.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, there was no indication at the meeting that Hamas was prepared to hand over its weapons, despite Trump&#8217;s combination of optimism and threat on this point.</p>



<p>So far, Hamas has publicly appeared to make handing over weapons contingent on &#8211; at least &#8211; Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p>



<p>Progress on this issue is critical because none of Trump&#8217;s proposals for reconstruction and governance can take place without a security force on the ground that has broad backing of the Palestinian population, given its role includes assuming a monopoly of force within Gaza.</p>



<p>The Washington meeting itself was characteristic of Trump&#8217;s approach to Israeli Palestinian peace-making over his two terms &#8211; involving a future for Palestinians seen often through the lens of real-estate development and wealthy investor funding.</p>



<p>Meanwhile Israel&#8217;s leadership has been wary about some of Trump&#8217;s efforts, particularly the invitations to his board for Turkey and Qatar, whom Israel does not want to see take a prominent role in decisions on the future of Gaza.</p>



<p>Trump and his team have defended his unconventional approach saying it amounts to &#8220;new thinking&#8221; to try to solve the conflict.</p>



<p>However, Mladenov has warned that without rapid progress, Gaza will remain split into two territories, one under continuing Israeli occupation and the other under Hamas control &#8211; and also split from the West Bank, making a future independent state unviable and failing to secure either Palestinians or Israelis.</p>

<p>Bolt Food has reiterated the importance of regulatory compliance for food service businesses operating on its platform, encouraging merchant partners in Ghana to ensure they hold valid Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) Hygiene Permits in line with national food safety regulations.</p>



<p>The reminder follows recent guidance from the FDA indicating that food establishments operating without valid hygiene permits risk enforcement actions, including closure.</p>



<p>Bolt Food noted that the communication forms part of its ongoing efforts to support food safety, protect public health, and promote responsible platform operations across Ghana.</p>



<p>Bolt Food encouraged restaurant and food service partners to confirm that their hygiene permits are valid and up to date, begin renewal or application processes where necessary, and keep documentation readily available for inspection.</p>



<p>The company emphasised that compliance not only supports regulatory alignment but also helps build customer trust and long-term business sustainability for merchants.</p>



<p>Speaking on the initiative, Bolt Food emphasised that its role as a platform includes supporting merchants with clear and timely communication around regulatory requirements, while maintaining high safety standards for consumers.</p>



<p>“Food safety is a shared responsibility across the entire ecosystem,” said Bolt Food General Manager, Ali Zaryab. “By encouraging our merchant partners to comply with FDA hygiene permit requirements, we are supporting safer food handling practices, protecting consumers, and helping merchants operate sustainably within Ghana’s regulatory framework.”</p>



<p>Bolt Food reaffirmed its commitment to working collaboratively with merchants and regulators to promote high hygiene standards and ensure a safe, reliable food delivery experience for customers across Ghana.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>From Italy to Germany, from Greece to Türkiye, from Belgium to France, Ricardo Faty’s playing career has taken him to quite a few different stops. But today, he’s back where it started: the Institut national du football de Clairefontaine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Born in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, France, on August 4, 1986, Faty was raised by a Senegalese-Vietnamese father and a Cape Verdean mother in the Parisian suburbs, where he got his first big break with Clairefontaine from 1999 to 2002. Faty then left his hometown and made the move to Strasbourg, where he spent three years before breaking into the first team in 2005/06. He would play 15 times for Strasbourg – one of which came vs. Roma – before earning a move to Roma, who took advantage of his lack of a professional contract and Strasbourg’s relegation and signed him for €350,000.</p>



<p>Faty would showcase his skills in Italy, excelling against the likes of Lyon, Manchester United, and Milan, and even man-marking 1999 Ballon d’Or winner Rivaldo out of the match on his UEFA Champions League debut. He made 15 appearances and helped Roma end a six-year trophy drought by winning the Coppa Italia, but he was unable to dislodge the likes of Daniele De Rossi, Simone Perotta, and David Pizarro from the starting line-up. It’s why he decided to join <a href="https://bookmaker-ratings.ru/match/football/bundesliga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bundesliga</a> side Bayer Leverkusen on a two-year loan, only to depart after six months and move to French side Nantes, where he experienced both promotion and relegation.</p>



<p>He then spent two years in Greece with Aris Salonica before joining French outfit AC Ajaccio in 2012; that same year, Faty would switch over from France to Senegal, playing five times for the Lions of Teranga. Whilst his progress was interrupted by an Achilles injury, Faty nevertheless made 50 appearances for Ajaccio before departing for Standard Liége following the club’s relegation. He spent a year in Belgium before making the move to Türkiye, where he spent five years with Burasaspor and MKE Ankaragücü, followed by a spell with Serie B outfit Reggina and a swan song with C&#8217;Chartres Football in the French fourth tier. Since retiring in 2023, Faty has balanced his time between raising his three daughters in Paris (his son is playing high school basketball in Providence, Rhode Island) and working as a pundit for major French television and radio outlets. And similarly to other retired players like <a href="https://r.org/2026/01/17/those-days-will-never-come-back-felipe-martins-ready-for-new-post-playing-journey/">Felipe Martins</a>, he’s made a smooth transition into coaching and is now coaching the next top boys and girls from the Île-de-France region in INF Clairefontaine.</p>



<p>Joy News spoke to Faty about a number of topics, including:</p>



<p><strong>You&#8217;ve been very outspoken about your experiences dealing with racism. I&#8217;m curious, do you think that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been distinct with you, the fact that you&#8217;ve been able to use your platform off the pitch to talk about one of society&#8217;s evils? And would you say that your experience with racism has differed from country to country?</strong></p>



<p>Okay, I&#8217;ll talk about my own experience. In my career, personally, I never experienced racism directly. But I was a witness of racism in every country I played, even in France. And the thing is, it’s human nature. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s like that. Maybe in some countries, it&#8217;s more present, but in every country, I’ve experienced some episode of racism. Maybe not in Türkiye: when I arrived in 2015, it was the start of the big bang of the social networks – Instagram, Twitter, and the first apparitions of cyberbullying –&nbsp; and in social media, you start to see some bananas and other stuff. But I’m not talking about virtual stuff, I’m talking about stuff on the pitch, face to face…I’ve never experienced that in Türkiye. But, in Greece, yes. In Italy, yes. In France, yes. Even in Belgium sometimes. Germany, no, but I only spent six months, so I can’t judge. This is a shame, because I’ve experienced that everywhere at a different level. Obviously, I’ve talked about it a lot with the French and Italian press, but the thing is, I’ve stopped talking about it because nothing has changed. Sometimes I speak face-to-face with some powerful people, like presidents or higher-ups from the federation and the league, I’ve held meetings with referees and said, ‘If you really want to put racism out of football, you should make a real statement so that nobody will say that again.’ It’s not enough to just close the stands or the stadium, because people won’t care; they’ll come back after the week. Like Samuel Eto’o said, you’ve got to hit their wallets, but they would never do that, because maybe they&#8217;re scared or afraid. Unfortunately, this is human nature: I think it will never stop.</p>



<p><strong>So you personally have never suffered racism in your playing career, but you&#8217;ve seen your teammates or other Black people suffer?</strong></p>



<p>I’ve seen Black people suffer racism, or I’ve seen someone talk badly about Black people. I’m light-skinned, so in certain countries, I’m not even considered Black, I’ll hear people being racist and will go, ‘What are you saying?’ They’re like, ‘But you’re not Black.’ I’ll say, ‘What, I’m white?’ They’ll say, ‘No, but this one is Black, you&#8217;re not Black. I say, ‘Okay, if you say so.’ This is the kind of thing, sometimes it&#8217;s just ignorance, and people aren’t educated enough about it. That’s why, sometimes, when I talk to a lot of people, they say that it&#8217;s not even racism, it&#8217;s ignorance. Sometimes, in the stands, it&#8217;s not even racism: people are just ignorant, they just want to put you out of the game, but I’m still not okay with that. That&#8217;s why they need education, but maybe the institutions, they don&#8217;t want that, they&#8217;re not okay with that…this is the sad truth.</p>



<p><strong>Lastly, after plying your trade in France, Italy, Germany, and Greece, what was it like making the move to Belgium?</strong></p>



<p>After my time in Ajaccio, I realized that it was time for me to move on because the team had suffered relegation to Ligue 2. To be honest, I wanted to stay in France, but I didn&#8217;t have a good offer that I liked, that I was attracted to, and Standard came with a premier project. I started to look down the team and everything, and what&#8217;s happening around the team, and I really enjoyed it. You know me, I always make my choices about the clubs, about the mentality, the supporters, and the project, and everything, the history of the team, so I liked it. Now, I was used to traveling, so I said, ‘Okay, now I&#8217;m turning 29, okay, let&#8217;s travel again.’ I decided to go to Belgium to discover a new league, a new country, a new stadium, and a new atmosphere. Honestly, I really enjoyed my time in Liège. I wish I could have stayed longer there, but I got into some trouble because the president was changing a lot, and the club was very unstable. After one year, they decided to sell me as I received an offer from Turkish club Bursaspor. I didn’t want to go, but they said, ‘Look, we need to change the strategy of the team, we’re focused on players who are 23/24 years old, whereas you&#8217;re 29. You should go there; even the contract in Türkiye is good, so consider this offer. After just one year, I left Liège for Bursaspor, but honestly, I enjoyed my time there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana has maintained its position as the world’s leading country in mobile money regulation, according to the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) Mobile Money Regulatory Index (MMRI) 2025. Ghana achieved an overall score of 96.10 percent, from 95.06 percent in the previous year.</p>



<p>This milestone underscores Ghana’s leadership in creating a world-class regulatory environment that enables mobile money services to thrive, drive financial inclusion and foster innovation in the digital financial ecosystem.</p>



<p>According to the GSMA, the MMRI measures the effectiveness of mobile money regulatory frameworks across 90 countries.</p>



<p>This ranking reflects the country’s commitment to progressive policies and robust oversight in the mobile money ecosystem, ensuring consumer protection, and operational integrity, and positions the country as a global benchmark for regulatory excellence in digital financial services.</p>



<p>The Bank will continue to collaborate with relevant stakeholders in the implementation of policies aimed at sustaining Ghana’s progress toward a fully inclusive and digitally empowered economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The government of Ghana has formally notified the government of Togo of its decision to refer their maritime boundary dispute to international arbitration.</p>



<p>In a statement released on Friday, February 20, Minister for Government Communications, Felix Kwakye Ofosu, confirmed that Ghana will seek the delimitation of the offshore boundary under the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the global legal framework governing the use of the world’s oceans.</p>



<p>The development follows eight years of bilateral negotiations between the two West African neighbours, which have failed to yield a mutually agreed settlement. Officials said repeated efforts to reach a diplomatic resolution had not resulted in a definitive outcome.</p>



<p>&#8220;This follows attempts at negotiating a boundary which have gone on for the past eight years but have not resulted in an agreed outcome,&#8221; the statement read.</p>



<div data-wp-interactive="core/file" class="wp-block-file"><object data-wp-bind--hidden="!state.hasPdfPreview" hidden class="wp-block-file__embed" data="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TOGO-4-1.pdf" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%;height:600px" aria-label="Embed of TOGO 4 (1)."></object><a id="wp-block-file--media-949f3075-d00c-4a5c-8b5c-d0bc2ba48526" href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TOGO-4-1.pdf">TOGO 4 (1)</a><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TOGO-4-1.pdf" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-949f3075-d00c-4a5c-8b5c-d0bc2ba48526" download>Download</a></div>



<p>According to the statement, Ghana has opted for arbitration in a bid to prevent further escalation of incidents that have generated tensions between certain state institutions in both countries. </p>



<p>The government stressed that the move is intended to promote an amicable and rules-based resolution to the dispute.</p>



<p>By pursuing arbitration under UNCLOS, Ghana aims to secure a binding legal determination while preserving the longstanding cordial relations between Accra and Lomé.</p>



<p><strong>Second Recourse to Arbitration in a Decade</strong></p>



<p>This marks the second time in recent years that Ghana has turned to international adjudication to settle a maritime boundary dispute.</p>



<p>In 2014, Ghana initiated arbitration proceedings against neighbouring Côte d&#8217;Ivoire following disagreements over their offshore boundary in the Gulf of Guinea, particularly after significant oil discoveries in the area.</p>



<p>The case was heard by a Special Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), operating under UNCLOS. </p>



<p>In September 2017, the tribunal delivered a binding judgment largely upholding Ghana’s position and formally delimiting the maritime boundary along an equidistance line.</p>
