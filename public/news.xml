										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>US President Donald Trump has said he is considering a limited military strike on Iran in order to pressure its leaders to agree a deal to curb the nuclear programme.</p>



<p>The president made the remark in response to a question from a journalist hours after officials had suggested the possibility of a strike.</p>



<p>On Thursday, Trump said the world would find out &#8220;over the next, probably, 10 days&#8221; whether a deal would be reached or the US would take military action. The US has been increasing its military presence in the region in recent weeks.</p>



<p>The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something Iran has always denied.</p>



<p>US and Iranian officials have met over the issue in Switzerland and said progress has been made in the talks.</p>



<p>Speaking on Friday, Iran&#8217;s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran was preparing &#8220;a draft of a possible agreement&#8221; and would hand it over to US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in the next few days.</p>



<p>The talks in Geneva were held as American forces continued ramping up their presence in the vicinity of Iran.</p>



<p>The deployment includes the world&#8217;s largest warship, USS Gerald R Ford, appearing to be heading towards the region.</p>



<p>USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is also being deployed, joining an increase of destroyers, combat ships and fighter jets.</p>



<p>Satellite images have also shown that Iran has reinforced military facilities, and the country&#8217;s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, has posted messages to social media threatening US forces.</p>



<p>&#8220;The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,&#8221; one of Khamenei&#8217;s posts read.</p>



<p>Trump takes questions from journalists several times a week &#8211; often in lengthy sessions in the Oval Office or on Air Force One &#8211; but his comments do not necessarily always translate into concrete actions, and often contradict each other.</p>



<p>He is fond of reminding reporters that he prefers to keep his intentions to himself and a small circle of insiders to avoid potential adversaries knowing his next moves.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to talk to you about that,&#8221; he snapped at a reporter on Thursday when asked about potential military action. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to make a deal or get a deal one way or the other.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even if an operation is carried out, Trump has so far yet to specify what the precise military objective would be, with US officials having reportedly presented him with a wide range of options for what could be a weeks-long campaign.</p>



<p>In the past, Trump has also used deadlines to achieve an element of surprise.</p>



<p>At the time of Operation Midnight Hammer in July last year &#8211; which saw US forces strike Iranian nuclear facilities &#8211; White House officials were still publicly discussing the possibility of successful talks.</p>



<p>The day before US missiles and bombs struck the facility, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt read a statement from Trump in which he said that because &#8220;negotiations may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks&#8221;.</p>



<p>Any strikes in the near future would come at a challenging time domestically for the Trump administration, with polls showing that a growing number of Americans disapprove of Trump&#8217;s handling of immigration and the economy.</p>



<p>Unlike the one-day strike in Iran last year and the quick operation to capture Nicolás Maduro in January, a protracted, multi-week conflict with Iran threatens alienating parts of Trump&#8217;s Maga base which were drawn to his campaign promise of an end to messy foreign entanglements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As the New Patriotic Party (NPP) regroups after its 2024 electoral defeat, a renewed sense of purpose is gradually shaping its march toward the 2028 general elections. </p>



<p>Whilst the loss of the presidential race by Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia triggered intense criticism and internal reflection, it has undoubtedly produced or reenergised a cadre of communicators whose resilience and evidence-based advocacy are redefining opposition politics. Among them, two voices stand out prominently: Dennis Miracles Aboagye and Akosua Manu.</p>



<p><strong>Dennis Miracles Aboagye: Evidence-Based Advocacy in Action</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>Dennis Miracles Aboagye, a seasoned communications strategist and former Director of Local Government Services under the NPP administration, has long been known for his articulate defence of party policy and governance philosophy. Rising through the ranks as a youth activist and policy advocate, he became one of the most visible defenders of Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia’s economic message during and after the 2024 campaign.</p>



<p>Even at the height of the fiercely contested 2026 NPP presidential primaries, Miracles Aboagye demonstrated what many describe as <em>field-based communication</em>. Rather than confining his arguments to television studios and social media platforms, he took the unusual step of visiting illegal mining (galamsey) sites in rural communities. His intention was clear, to gather first-hand evidence on the state of illegal mining under the National Democratic Congress (NDC) administration and to demonstrate that the fight against galamsey had not seen significant improvement since the NDC assumed office in January 2025.</p>



<p>The optics were powerful. Images and reports from these visits reinforced his argument that rhetoric alone cannot fight environmental degradation. By physically engaging affected communities and documenting conditions on the ground, he anchored political communication in observable realities. This approach is a strong political capital in a political environment often dominated by partisan claims and counterclaims.</p>



<p>His evidence-driven approach did not end there. Shortly after the presidential primaries concluded, Miracles Aboagye shifted attention to the cocoa sector. He visited cocoa-growing communities to interact with farmers grappling with production challenges, pricing concerns and the broader crisis facing Ghana’s cocoa industry. Few days later, the NDC government announced a reduction in cocoa producer prices, an unprecedented decision in Ghana’s history. Traditionally, even during downturns in global market prices, successive governments have sought to shield cocoa farmers from price cuts which is not the case in the current approach by the government.</p>



<p>The timing intensified public debate. Whether coincidental or influenced by heightened scrutiny, the sequence of events underscored the potency of evidence-based communication. By highlighting farmer grievances before the price announcement, Miracles Aboagye positioned the NPP as a vigilant opposition, holding government accountable through facts and community engagement.</p>



<p>Such a strategy is paramount in democratic governance. Opposition parties do not merely seek power; they also serve as watchdogs. When communication is grounded in verifiable evidence, it compels governments to respond substantively rather than rhetorically. In this sense, Miracles Aboagye’s approach exemplifies how structured, data-informed advocacy can keep incumbents on their toes while elevating national discourse.</p>



<p><strong>Akosua Manu: Calm Strength in Political Communication</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>If Miracles Aboagye represents assertive field engagement, Akosua Manu symbolizes composure and strategic calm. A former Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the National Youth Authority and the NPP parliamentary candidate for Adentan in the 2024 elections, Manu popularly known as <em>Kozie</em>&nbsp;has steadily built a reputation as one of the party’s most articulate young female voices.</p>



<p>Though she lost the Adentan parliamentary seat in 2024, her post-election conduct has been instructive. In an era where political discourse is frequently marred by hostility and provocation, Akosua Manu’s calm demeanour stands out. She engages critics firmly but respectfully, articulating policy contrasts without descending into personal attacks.</p>



<p>Her communication style reflects both discipline and emotional intelligence traits that are increasingly valuable in Ghana’s polarized political environment. Even in the face of adversity and electoral disappointment, she has remained committed to amplifying the NPP’s message and defending Dr. Bawumia’s vision with clarity and grace.</p>



<p>Beyond party loyalty, Akosua Manu embodies a broader aspiration: the strengthening of women’s voices in Ghanaian politics. The political arena remains male-dominated and young women often face disproportionate scrutiny. Yet Manu’s consistency, eloquence and resilience suggest that she is among the emerging leaders poised to occupy higher leadership roles in the years ahead.</p>



<p>As the 2028 elections approach, her journey sends an encouraging signal to young women across Ghana that setbacks are not endpoints but stepping stones. By maintaining her composure and deepening her policy engagement, she not only serves her party but also contributes to reshaping the narrative about women in leadership.</p>



<p><strong>Communication as a Tool for National Progress</strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>The experiences of Dennis Miracles Aboagye and Akosua Manu underscore a central lesson for the NPP as it rebuilds, communication must be strategic, evidence-based, and disciplined. It is not enough to criticize; the criticism must be anchored in facts, community engagement and policy alternatives.</p>



<p>When opposition figures visit galamsey sites, engage cocoa farmers and substantiate claims with on-the-ground evidence, they elevate public debate. When communicators maintain civility under pressure, they strengthen democratic culture. In both cases, the ultimate beneficiary is Ghana.</p>



<p>As the NPP looks toward 2028 with renewed spirit, Miracles Aboagye, Akosua Manu and many others must not relent. Their voices are critical not merely for partisan victory but for national accountability. By communicating effectively and responsibly, they can keep the NDC government responsive and attentive to the needs of citizens.</p>



<p>In the end, vibrant democracy depends on strong opposition and responsible government alike. If these communicators continue their par-excellence advocacy, grounded in facts and marked by discipline, they will not only energize their party’s base but also contribute meaningfully to Ghana’s democratic consolidation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump has vowed to impose a new 10% global tariff to replace ones struck down by the Supreme Court, calling the ruling "terrible" and lambasting the justices who rejected his trade policy as "fools".]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>US President Donald Trump has vowed to impose a new 10% global tariff to replace ones struck down by the Supreme Court, calling the ruling &#8220;terrible&#8221; and lambasting the justices who rejected his trade policy as &#8220;fools&#8221;.</p>



<p>The president unveiled the plan shortly after the justices outlawed most of the global tariffs the White House announced last year.</p>



<p>In a 6-3 decision, the court held that the president had overstepped his powers.</p>



<p>The decision was a major victory for businesses and US states that had challenged the duties, opening the door to potentially billions of dollars in tariff refunds, while also injecting new uncertainty into the global trade landscape.</p>



<p>Speaking from the White House on Friday, Trump indicated that refunds would not come without a legal battle, saying he expected the matter to be tied up in court for years.</p>



<p>He also said he would turn to other laws to press ahead with his tariffs, which he has argued encourage investment and manufacturing in the US.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have alternatives &#8211; great alternatives and we&#8217;ll be a lot stronger for it,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The court battle was focused on import taxes that Trump unveiled last year on goods from nearly every country in the world.</p>



<p>The tariffs initially targeted Mexico, Canada and China, before expanding dramatically to dozens of trade partners on what the president billed as &#8220;Liberation Day&#8221; last April.</p>



<p>The White House had cited a 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which gives the president power to &#8220;regulate&#8221; trade in response to an emergency.</p>



<p>But the measures sparked outcry at home and abroad from firms facing an abrupt rise in taxes on shipments entering the US, and fuelled worries that the levies would lead to higher prices.</p>



<p>Arguing before the court last year, lawyers for the challenging states and small businesses said that the law used by the president to impose the levies made no mention of the word &#8220;tariffs&#8221;.</p>



<p>They said that Congress did not intend to hand off its power to tax or give the president an &#8220;open-ended power to junk&#8221; other existing trade deals and tariff rules.</p>



<p>In his opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, sided with that view.</p>



<p>&#8220;When Congress has delegated its tariff powers, it has done so in explicit terms and subject to strict limits,&#8221; he wrote.</p>



<p>&#8220;Had Congress intended to convey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs, it would have done so expressly, as it consistently has in other tariff statutes.&#8221;</p>



<p>The decision to strike down the tariffs was joined by the court&#8217;s three liberal justices, as well as two justices nominated by Trump: Amy Coney Barrett and Neil Gorsuch.</p>



<p>Three conservative justices, Clarence Thomas, Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito, dissented.</p>



<p>At the White House, Trump said he was &#8220;absolutely ashamed&#8221; of the Republican appointees on the court who voted against his trade policy.</p>



<p>He said they were &#8220;just being fools and lap dogs&#8221; and were &#8220;very unpatriotic and disloyal to our Constitution&#8221;.</p>



<p>Shares on Wall Street rose after the announcement, with the S&amp;P 500 closing up about 0.7%, as businesses across the US cautiously welcomed the ruling.</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel&#8230; like a thousand-pound weight has been lifted off my chest,&#8221; said Beth Benike, the owner of Busy Baby products in Minnesota, which manufactures products in China.</p>



<p>Nik Holm, chief executive of Terry Precision Cycling, one of the small businesses involved in the case, called the ruling a &#8220;relief&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Though it will be many months before our supply chain is back up and running as normal, we look forward to the government&#8217;s refund of these improperly-collected duties,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The anticipated refunds and relief from tariff costs may prove elusive, however.</p>



<p>On Friday, Trump said he was imposing the new 10% tariff under a never-used law known as Section 122, which gives the power to put in place tariffs up to 15% for 150 days, at which point Congress must step in.</p>



<p>Analysts expect the White House to consider other tools, such as Section 232 and Section 301, which allow import taxes to address national security risks and unfair trade practices.</p>



<p>Trump has previously used those tools for tariffs, including some announced last year on sectors such as steel, aluminium and cars. Those were untouched by the court ruling.</p>



<p>A White House official said countries that struck trade deals with the US, including the UK, India and the EU, will now face the global 10% tariff under Section 122 rather than the tariff rate they had previously negotiated.</p>



<p>The Trump administration expects those countries to keep abiding by the concessions they had agreed to under the trade deals, the official added.</p>



<p>&#8220;Things have only gotten more complicated and more messy today,&#8221; said Geoffrey Gertz, senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington.</p>



<p>Reaction by major trade partners was relatively muted.</p>



<p>&#8220;We take note of the ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court and are analysing it carefully,&#8221; European Commission spokesman Olof Gill wrote on social media.</p>



<p>The US has already collected at least $130bn in tariffs using the IEEPA law,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/trade" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the most recent government data</a>.</p>



<p>In recent weeks, hundreds of firms, including retailer Costco, aluminium giant Alcoa and food importers like tuna fish brand Bumble Bee, have filed lawsuits contesting the tariffs, in a bid to get in line for a refund.</p>



<p>But the decision by the majority does not directly mention refunds, likely handing back the question of how that process might work to the Court of International Trade.</p>



<p>In his dissent, Justice Brett Kavanaugh warned the situation would be a &#8220;mess&#8221;.</p>



<p>Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG US, warned that the cost of litigation could make recouping funds difficult for smaller firms.</p>



<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, I&#8217;d say curb your enthusiasm, although I understand the desire for relief,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Steve Becker, head of the law firm Pillsbury, said the &#8220;best thing&#8221; for businesses would be if the government created a procedure that did not require filing a lawsuit.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think companies can be fairly confident that they&#8217;ll get their money back eventually,&#8221; he added. &#8220;How long it will take really is up to the government.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President John Mahama says Ghana has the potential to supply steel to the entire West African sub-region if the country succeeds in building a strong and competitive domestic steel industry.</p>



<p>Speaking at the commissioning of the B5 Plus Limited Steel Manufacturing Plant at Prampram on Friday, February 20, the President outlined an ambitious vision to position Ghana as a regional steel powerhouse.</p>



<p>He said the country is deliberately moving up the industrial value chain by prioritising the export of finished and semi-finished products instead of raw scrap materials.</p>



<p>“We are moving up the value chain. We’re exporting finished and semi-finished products, not raw scrap,” he stated.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/ban-on-non-ferrous-scrap-export-to-boost-processed-metal-earnings-by-up-to-300m-annually-mahama/">Read also: Ban on non-ferrous scrap export to boost processed metal earnings by up to $300m annually – Mahama</a></li>
</ul>



<p>President Mahama linked the growth of the steel industry to the government’s “Big Push” infrastructure programme, which includes heavy investment in roads and highways, railway modernization, bridges and interchanges, energy transmission lines, affordable housing and industrial parks.</p>



<p>“All these I have mentioned require iron and steel,” he said. </p>



<p>“Africa is projected to require over $100 billion annually in infrastructure development. West Africa alone faces significant infrastructure deficits.”</p>



<p>According to him, Ghana stands to benefit immensely if it develops a strong steel base capable of meeting both domestic and regional demand.</p>



<p>“If Ghana develops a strong steel base, we not only build our own roads and bridges, we will also supply steel to the whole sub-region. This is how infrastructure becomes industrial strategy,” he said.</p>



<p>The President further highlighted the importance of the government’s 24-hour economy initiative to energy-intensive industries such as steel manufacturing. </p>



<p>He revealed that signing the 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill into law is a critical step toward boosting industrial productivity.</p>



<p>He noted that B5 Plus Group is expected to be among the first companies to register under the 24-hour economy programme.</p>



<p>“Steel production benefits from continuous operation to reduce energy wastage, improve efficiency, lower unit production costs, and maximise asset utilisation,” he said.</p>



<p>President Mahama added that with dedicated industrial tariff reforms, improved grid stability and expanding domestic gas supply, Ghanaian manufacturers can operate competitively beyond traditional working hours.</p>



<p>He disclosed that $110 million has been allocated in the 2026 budget to operationalise the 24-hour economy initiative, signalling what he described as the government’s seriousness about industrial transformation.</p>



<p>“When factories run three shifts instead of one, employment rises, productivity increases, and exports expand,” he said.</p>



<p>The President added that a thriving steel industry, supported by infrastructure investment and continuous production, would not only strengthen Ghana’s economy but also position the country as a key industrial supplier within West Africa.</p>

<p>Gyakie’s thoughtful move has been widely applauded as a reminder of the power of partnership in the entertainment industry, highlighting that success is often built on collective effort and enduring professional relationships.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ahafo Regional Director of the Ghana Tourism Authority (GTA), Alfred Asumadu, says imprisonment is not hopelessness, but a potential turning point toward economic independence, as he empowered prison inmates not to lose hope.</p>



<p>He made these remarks at Kenyasi in the Ahafo region when the GTA, as part of activities to mark this year’s National Chocolate Month (NCM), visited the Kenyasi Settlement Prison Camp to express love to the inmates.</p>



<p>Mr Asumadu, who led the delegation, donated boxes of made-in-Ghana chocolate, assorted soft drinks, bags of maize and gari, and sachet water.</p>

<p>The visit was aimed at bridging the gap between incarcerated individuals and the rest of society through the universal language of love and shared national pride.</p>



<p>Mr. Asumadu noted that the Kenyasi Settlement Prison is a strategic facility focused on agricultural production. He called for better strategic planning regarding inmate care, stressing that public expressions of love are the keys to successful reintegration.</p>



<p>&#8220;When the public expresses love and care, it encourages them to become self-reliant in the future,&#8221; Mr Asumadu noted, adding that the goal of the visit was to signal to the prisoners that they remain &#8220;part and parcel of society.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chief Superintendent of Prisons (CSP) Elvis IK Ahadzi, the Officer in Charge of the camp, dismissed the notion that imprisonment equates to a lost life.</p>



<p>Addressing the inmates and visitors, he reiterated that the camp serves as a training ground for those willing to humble themselves and embrace the vocational opportunities available.</p>



<p>&#8220;Prisoners become economically viable after regaining their freedom when they take the employable skills training offered here seriously,&#8221; CSP Ahadzi stated.</p>



<p>He highlighted that the presence of religious groups, corporate bodies, and individuals like the GTA helps shape the lifestyle of inmates, empowering them to aspire for a better future post-liberation.</p>

<p>The promotion of locally produced chocolate is a cornerstone of the &#8220;Chocolate Month&#8221; celebrations.</p>



<p>By sharing these treats with inmates, the GTA aimed to include them in the national pride of being the world&#8217;s second-largest cocoa producer and to encourage the consumption of home-grown products.</p>



<p>Beyond the sweet taste, the choice of cocoa-based gifts carries significant health implications. Authentic Ghanaian chocolate, rich in high-quality cocoa, offers several benefits, including heart health, acting as a natural antidepressant, and antioxidant power, among others.</p>



<p>CSP Ahadzi thanked the GTA for their kindness, noting that the gesture had significantly boosted the morale of the inmates, proving that even behind bars, hope and the taste of home are never far away.</p>

<p>Chairman of Parliament’s Select Committee on Sports, Ernest Norgbey, has revealed that some GH¢150 million has been allocated for the Black Stars preparations for the 2026 World Cup.</p>



<p>According to him, the funds are intended to ensure the team gets the best of preparation for the tournament to be hosted in USA, Canada and Mexico.</p>



<p>“Well, when you talk of funding, the government has allocated about GH¢150 million for the preparation as we speak now.” he told CitiSports.</p>



<p>Mr. Norgbey emphasized that although FIFA is expected to provide financial support, those funds may not be available early enough to cover the immediate costs associated with preparation for the tournament.</p>



<p>“but we still need funding because, yes, we know that FIFA will be giving us some amount of money, but that amount of money will not come before even the preparation” he noted.</p>



<p>While it remains unclear what specific aspects of the preparation the funds will be used for, the team is scheduled to face Germany and Austria in the next international window as part of preparations for the tournament.</p>

<p>The Ghana Public Health Association, in collaboration with the Coalition of Actors for Public Health Action (CAPHA), has organized a training workshop for media professionals on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), aimed at strengthening advocacy for healthier food policies in Ghana.</p>



<p>The training focuses on how the government can regulate and reduce the rise of NCDs through legal measures, including Front-of-Pack warning labels and market restrictions on unhealthy foods.</p>



<p>Organizers believe journalists play a key role in shaping public understanding and influencing policy decisions.</p>



<p>Globally, NCDs account for about 74 percent of all deaths, claiming over 41 million lives each year. Of this number, nearly 17.9 million deaths are due to cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes, about 9.3 million from cancers, 4.1 million from chronic respiratory diseases, and 2 million from diabetes.</p>

<p>Most premature deaths, especially among people aged 30 to 70, occur in low- and middle-income countries. These figures highlight the urgent need for preventive policies.</p>



<p>Dr. Charles Apprey of the Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology at KNUST said the initiative is part of efforts to improve food governance in the country. He highlighted the importance of introducing Front-of-Pack warning labels to help consumers make informed choices at the point of purchase.</p>



<p>“We think that if we’re able to push for the government to legislate this front of pack warning label, it’s going to give our people informed choice on what kind of food they’re buying or what kind of food they’re picking on the shelf, we’re also looking at market restrictions because we think that other countries that have done this, it has worked and evidence is there to show so that we be able to restrict advertisements of unhealthy foods to the vulnerable in the population,” Dr. Apprey said.</p>

<p>He noted that NCDs are increasing globally and locally, largely due to unhealthy diets, high salt and sugar intake, tobacco use, harmful alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity. Many countries have introduced food-related policies such as sugar taxes, warning labels, and advertising restrictions to slow the rise.</p>



<p>Project Lead James Mckeown Amoah also stressed the severity of the situation, explaining that NCDs such as hypertension, cancer, and diabetes are not infectious but account for the majority of deaths.</p>



<p>“We brought the journalists today for them to get to know the burden of NCDs in Ghana. 65 percent of people who die in Ghana die from NCDs. Look at the global figures, 74 percent of all those who die in the world die from NCDs. Over 41 million people die every year from NCDs and therefore there’s the need for us to take an action and the action includes training journalists and making sure that this information goes to the general public so Ghanaians can live much healthier,” he said.</p>



<p>The organizers believe that empowering the media with accurate data and evidence will strengthen public awareness, encourage healthier lifestyles, and support policies that create a healthier food environment for all Ghanaians</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It helps you plan before you pour, think before you announce, and calculate before you commit.

Because sometimes, the building is not the problem.

The blueprint is.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>(A satirical dispatch from the Republic).</p>



<p>Once upon a time in the Republic of Uncommon Sense, we did not merely build houses.</p>



<p>We built intentions.</p>



<p>Drive through almost any community in Ghana and you will see them — proud pillars, exposed iron rods, half-finished walls standing confidently against the sky like monuments to optimism.</p>



<p>These are not abandoned buildings.</p>



<p>They are declarations.</p>



<p>They are architectural announcements that say:</p>



<p>“I have started.”</p>



<p>And in our culture, starting is almost completion.</p>



<p>We celebrate foundation. We organize slab ceremonies. We take photos with cement mixers. But when it comes to roofing? Windows? Plumbing?</p>



<p>Ah.</p>



<p>That is where mathematics interrupts ambition.</p>



<p>Let us examine the formula.</p>



<p>You buy land.</p>



<p>You start building.</p>



<p>You assume money will “continue.”</p>



<p>Then inflation enters like an uninvited uncle at a wedding — loud, disruptive, and impossible to ignore.</p>



<p>Suddenly, cement prices have increased. Iron rods are behaving like gold. Labour has adjusted upward. Transport has adjusted upward. Your salary, however, remains patriotic — unchanged since independence.</p>



<p>And just like that, the project moves to what every Ghanaian understands as:</p>



<p>Phase Two.</p>



<p>Phase Two is a mysterious location.</p>



<p>Nobody has seen it.</p>



<p>But everybody believes in it.</p>



<p>“Next year we will continue.”</p>



<p>“After the bonus we will continue.”</p>



<p>“When cocoa season is good, we will continue.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the iron rods continue standing faithfully toward heaven, rusting gently in prayer.</p>



<p>But let us pause the laughter for a moment.</p>



<p>Uncompleted buildings in Ghana are not just neighborhood jokes.</p>



<p>They represent:</p>



<p>* Locked capital</p>



<p>* Financial strain</p>



<p>* Urban disorder</p>



<p>* Security risks</p>



<p>* Mosquito training academies</p>



<p>* Emotional stress for families</p>



<p>Sometimes, entire life savings are frozen in concrete that never reaches a roof.</p>



<p>Sometimes, a man’s retirement plan is standing roofless, collecting rainwater and regret.</p>



<p>And here is the deeper truth:</p>



<p>This is not just about buildings.</p>



<p>It is about how we plan.</p>



<p>We start businesses without runway.</p>



<p>We launch initiatives without feasibility studies.</p>



<p>We announce before we analyze.</p>



<p>We pour before we calculate.</p>



<p>The building is simply the metaphor.</p>



<p>In the Republic, ambition runs faster than arithmetic.</p>



<p>Now imagine a different culture.</p>



<p>Imagine we normalized:</p>



<p>Planning before pouring.</p>



<p>Financing before foundation.</p>



<p>Completion before expansion.</p>



<p>Imagine children growing up asking, “Daddy, why do old houses have iron rods sticking out?”</p>



<p>And we respond, “That was the old Ghana.”</p>



<p>Progress would not be loud.</p>



<p>It would be finished.</p>



<p>Now let me ask you:</p>



<p>How many unfinished buildings are in your area?</p>



<p>Is yours one of them?</p>



<p>What stopped it?</p>



<p>Inflation? Over-ambition? Poor planning? Life?</p>



<p>Let’s have an honest conversation.</p>



<p>Because satire is not mockery.</p>



<p>It is reflection wearing a smile.</p>



<p>If this made you laugh — and think — share it.</p>



<p>Tag someone currently in Phase Two.</p>



<p>And follow Republic of Uncommon Sense for more national therapy.</p>



<p>Because if we can finish the joke…</p>



<p>Perhaps we can finish the building.</p>



<p>Before You Go…</p>



<p>If you are tired of Phase Two thinking — in construction, in business, or in life — then it may be time to upgrade your mental blueprint.</p>



<p>The Uncommon Sense Playbook: Thinking Clearly in Noisy Times is not about cement.</p>



<p>It is about clarity.</p>



<p>It helps you plan before you pour, think before you announce, and calculate before you commit.</p>



<p>Because sometimes, the building is not the problem.</p>



<p>The blueprint is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Majority Leader in Parliament, Mahama Ayariga, has declared that the government will not succumb to pressure to reinstate the previous cocoa producer price, insisting that fiscal realities make such a move untenable.</p>



<p>Speaking on the floor of Parliament on Friday, February 20, Mr. Ayariga said while the John Mahama administration had pledged to substantially increase the producer price of cocoa, current revenue constraints mean the government cannot fully deliver on that commitment at this time.</p>



<p>He maintained that decisions on cocoa pricing are guided by available resources and prevailing economic conditions, not political agitation.</p>



<p>According to him, the ongoing global challenges affecting the cocoa sector have had a direct impact on government revenue and the income of farmers, making it impossible to promise what the state does not have.</p>



<p>“You cannot give what you don’t have, even if you promised it,” he said. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AYARIGA-COCOA-PROTEST.mp3.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>“What you are proposing is what you did, and you collapsed the economy of Ghana. You put COCOBOD in debt over 36 billion Ghana cedis. All of that is the cocoa farmers’ money. So we are not going to pander to those sentiments.”</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/govt-sets-new-farmgate-cocoa-price-at-gh%e2%82%b541392-per-tonne-for-2025-2026-season/">Read also: Gov’t sets new farmgate cocoa price at GH₵41,392 per tonne for 2025–2026 season</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The Majority Leader dismissed claims that a recent demonstration against the reduction in cocoa producer prices was driven by genuine farmers. </p>



<p>He suggested that the protest was politically motivated.</p>



<p>“I can assure you that the demonstrators, we know who they are. And we know their real motivation for demonstrating,” he stated. </p>



<p>“Genuine cocoa farmers know that there is a world crisis. And that world crisis is definitely going to affect their bottom line, which is the income that they will earn from the cocoa sector.”</p>



<p>Mr. Ayariga argued that the effects of the global downturn are not limited to smallholder farmers, stressing that many Members of Parliament and ministers are also cocoa farmers and will equally feel the impact of falling prices.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AYARIGA-INVITATION.mp3.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>“All of us, when the cocoa prices go down, I can assure you that many Members of Parliament sitting on this side are also going to lose income. I know ministers who are cocoa farmers, and I know that they also are going to lose income,” he said. </p>



<p>“The impression should not be created that it is only the ordinary person sitting out there in the village who is going to lose income. Everybody loses income as a result of this global crisis that has confronted us.”</p>



<p>He added that while the situation is difficult, the government’s approach is aimed at protecting the long-term stability of the cocoa sector rather than taking decisions that could worsen existing financial pressures.</p>

<p>In an emotional testament to timely intervention and collective compassion, the Ghana Medical Trust Fund (GMTF) has successfully funded a life-saving brain surgery for Mumuni Jamil, an ICT tutor at Wa Technical Institute in the Upper West Region.</p>



<p>Diagnosed with a brain Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM), a rare and life-threatening condition requiring highly specialised neurosurgical care, Mumuni’s prognosis initially left his family devastated and overwhelmed by the cost of treatment.</p>



<p>According to family head Mumuni Baba Seidu, the diagnosis plunged the family into anguish as the required medical intervention was far beyond their financial reach.</p>



<p>Matters worsened mid-flight when Mumuni, who was being transported from Wa to Accra for further medical evaluation, suffered a critical episode that forced an emergency landing in Tamale.</p>



<p>Doctors at the Tamale Teaching Hospital worked swiftly to resuscitate and stabilise him, buying valuable time and keeping hope alive.</p>



<p>Upon arrival in Accra, specialists confirmed that his condition required urgent surgery at Euracare Advanced Diagnostics and Heart Centre.</p>



<p>However, the cost of the procedure — GHS 235,940.00 — presented what appeared to be an insurmountable barrier. For many families, such a financial burden would have marked the end of available options.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Mumuni’s case coincided with the Ghana Medical Trust Fund’s 50-pilot case intervention programme. The Fund stepped in and covered the full cost of the surgery.</p>



<p>The complex procedure was successful, and today Mumuni has not only regained his health but has reunited with his family as a survivor rather than a patient in distress.</p>



<p>Speaking during a visit to the Fund’s offices to express gratitude, the family described the intervention as life-changing. “The Ghana Medical Trust Fund represents more than a medical support scheme.</p>



<p>It stands as a symbol of compassionate leadership, social responsibility, and national solidarity,” they said.</p>



<p>Administrator Adjoa Obuobia Darko-Opoku reaffirmed the Fund’s commitment to supporting critically ill Ghanaians, noting that sustained backing would enable many more lives to be saved.</p>



<p>The case, she emphasised, demonstrates how collective compassion can transform near-tragedy into renewed hope.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The family of a baby allegedly stolen from the Mamprobi Polyclinic in Accra, is demanding justice and the prosecution of the suspect following the child’s recovery.</p>



<p>The Member of Parliament for Odododiodio constituency, where the incident occurred, has also called for stronger security measures to prevent similar incidents. </p>



<p>The incident which occurred earlier this week, sparked fear and outrage among residents after reports emerged that a woman allegedly posed as a patient and made away with the newborn. </p>



<p>The baby was later found and has since been reunited with its mother, while the suspect remains in police custody to assist with investigations.</p>



<p>Relatives say the baby has developed infections following the ordeal and insist the suspect must be prosecuted to deter similar crimes. They are also calling on authorities to strengthen security at health facilities to better protect mothers and newborns.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260218_090800-3.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Uncle of the recovered baby, Mohammed Sackey, stressed the family’s demand for justice.<br>“We want justice for this child. The suspect must be prosecuted so this will not happen to any other family again. The baby has suffered, and we don’t want this case to end without punishment,” he said.</p>



<p>The father of the child, Mohammed Agyekum, expressed gratitude to the Gender Minister for her support, but maintained that the law must take its course.</p>



<p>“We are grateful to the Gender Minister for showing concern and supporting us through this difficult time. Her intervention has helped bring attention to this case, and we truly appreciate it,” he said.</p>



<p>The Member of Parliament for Odododiodio Constituency, Nii Lantey Kotey Ashie, described the incident as unfortunate and called for tighter security at health facilities to prevent similar occurrences.<br>He said he intends to raise the matter on the floor of Parliament and push for a full investigation to ensure accountability.</p>



<p>“This is very unfortunate and should not happen at our health facilities. I will make a statement on the floor of Parliament to ensure that a full investigation is conducted, and measures are put in place to prevent this from happening again. The family deserves justice,” he stated.</p>



<p>Police say investigations are ongoing as officers work to identify any possible accomplices and determine how the suspect was able to leave the facility with the baby.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As Ghana navigates a tense political and security climate, this week’s edition of Newsfile on <strong>JoyNews</strong>, hosted by Samson Lardy Anyenini, is set to confront four major national and international issues that strike at the heart of governance, justice, and state responsibility.</p>



<p>At the top of the agenda is the reported killing of eight Ghanaian citizens in a terrorist attack in neighbouring Burkina Faso which has raised concerns about regional insecurity, border protection, and the state’s responsibility to safeguard its citizens abroad.</p>



<p>On the back of this development, there has been calls for President John Mahama to appoint a substantive Defence Minister. Are the calls valid or just politics?</p>



<p>The programme is expected to interrogate whether the Ghanaian state did enough to protect its nationals, particularly traders and migrants who operate within high-risk zones.</p>



<p>Attention then moves from regional security concerns to a troubling case involving a Russian national accused of sexual exploitation, with explicit footage reportedly circulating online.</p>



<p>Beyond determining criminal responsibility, the central issue is whether justice will ultimately be served, especially as the government weighs the possibility of extradition.</p>



<p>With international elements at play, questions arise about the strength and efficiency of Ghana’s extradition processes. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, governance and accountability return to the forefront with developments surrounding former Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta. Reports that he has been taken off an INTERPOL Red Notice have stirred debate about the strength and direction of ongoing investigations connected to his tenure in office.</p>



<p>A Red Notice is a global request to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending legal action. Its removal raises pressing questions: Was the notice procedurally flawed? Does this weaken the case? Or does it reflect a legal recalibration rather than an exoneration? The matter intersects with Ghana’s anti-corruption drive, due process rights, and the perception of whether international policing tools are being used appropriately in politically sensitive cases.</p>



<p>Rounding out the discussion is the Chief Justice’s dismissal of petitions challenging the removal processes involving the heads of the Electoral Commission and the Office of the Special Prosecutor, on the grounds that no prima facie case had been established.</p>



<p>Join <strong>JoyNews&#8217; </strong>Samson Lardy Anyenini and the experts as they delve into the national issues.</p>



<p>Newsfile airs live on the JoyNews channel on digital satellite channels 421 on DSTV and 144 on GoTV, and streams on JoyNews’ Facebook or YouTube channels on Saturdays from 9 am to noon.</p>



<p>Viewers can also follow the discussion by tuning in to Joy 99.7 FM or Luv 99.5 FM on the radio or stream the discussion live on either Google or Apple Podcasts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana Link Network Services Limited, operators of the Integrated Customs Management System (ICUMS), says all 18 transit trucks captured under Bill of Entry (BOE) 80226125039 have been accounted for on its electronic tracking platform.</p>



<p>In a statement issued on Friday, 20 February, the company clarified that the six trucks earlier reported as missing were fully traceable on its electronic tracking system.</p>



<p>The clarification follows reports that the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) had stepped up efforts to trace six articulated trucks suspected to be unaccounted for in an alleged transit diversion scheme involving goods with potential tax exposure exceeding GH¢85 million.</p>



<p>The trucks formed part of a consignment of 18 vehicles electronically gated out of the Customs system as transit cargo but were allegedly found moving within Ghana without the mandatory Customs escort.</p>



<p>Twelve of the trucks were intercepted during a late-night enforcement operation along the Dawhenya–Tema Road, while six were reported yet to be located.</p>

<p>However, Ghana Link said its electronic tracking data, playback analysis, and physical verification exercises confirm that all the trucks have been located.</p>



<p>“As of yesterday and this morning, Ghana Link’s field team physically confirmed their locations as seen on our tracking system. We have transmitted the information and report to the Customs Division for any action deemed necessary under the law,” the statement said.</p>



<p>According to the company, playback data showed that the trucks initially travelled along the declared transit route from Akanu to Kulungugu until authorities directed 11 of them to proceed to the Tema Customs transit yard.</p>



<p>“This should be understood as an enforcement-led diversion for control purposes, not evidence that the trucks had disappeared,” the statement clarified.</p>



<p>Ghana Link said two of the trucks were located at Aflao, another two at the Aflao–Accra toll booth, and one each at West Point Filling Station in Tsopoli, Galaxy Filling Station in Dawhenya, and Akanu.</p>



<p>ICUMS further emphasised that 11 trucks were moved to a controlled holding point at the Tema Transit Yard, while the remaining trucks were traceable, located, physically verified, and handed over to Customs on Friday, 20 February.</p>



<p>The company reiterated that its tracking systems are designed to replace uncertainty with verifiable evidence, stating that playback data accounted for all trucks under the BOE, including those described in some media reports as missing.</p>



<p>Ghana Link acknowledged the seriousness of any suspected breaches of the transit regime and expressed support for lawful investigations by the GRA and other relevant state agencies, including National Security.</p>



<p>It maintained that its role is to provide reliable visibility over transit movements through tracking data and operational support to authorities, reaffirming its commitment to strengthening revenue mobilisation and facilitating trade in Ghana.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A French soldier has died after he was shot in the head while taking part in a game with other soldiers during a party, according to local media.</p>



<p>Brigadier Alexandre Lanckbeen was critically injured during the incident last Saturday while attending a party involving alcohol at the Percy Military Teaching Hospital in Clamart, west of Paris.</p>



<p>According to French prosecutors, a loaded handgun was discharged during what was described as a game between the soldiers, and a bullet struck Lanckbeen in the head.</p>



<p>Loïc Mizon, the military governor of Paris, said he had learned with &#8220;deep sadness&#8221; of the 20-year-old&#8217;s death on Friday as a result of his injuries.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wish to express my deepest compassion to his family and loved ones and assure them of the full support of the armed forces,&#8221; he said in a post on X.</p>



<p>Brigadier Lanckbeen served with the 35th Parachute Artillery Regiment based in Tarbes, and was deployed as part of Operation Sentinelle, a long-running domestic security operation.</p>



<p>According to prosecutors, on Saturday evening four soldiers housed at Percy Hospital had begun playing a game known within the military that involves attempting to disarm a colleague and disable their weapon.</p>



<p>The weapon is usually unloaded when the game is played but in this case it was not, according to local media.</p>



<p>During the game, a shot was fired which struck Lanckbeen in the head.</p>



<p>Three soldiers who were also deployed as part of Operation Sentinelle appeared before a Paris court on Tuesday in connection with the shooting, according to local media.</p>



<p>One soldier was charged with &#8220;violence with a weapon resulting in permanent disability and breaching orders by consuming alcohol&#8221;, reports said.</p>



<p>The other two soldiers were reportedly charged with &#8220;involuntary bodily harm resulting in a work incapacity exceeding three months, through a manifestly deliberate violation of regulatory obligation of safety or caution&#8221;.</p>



<p>They were also charged with &#8220;altering the scene of a crime or offense to obstruct the course of justice&#8221;.</p>



<p>Following Lanckbeen&#8217;s death, the charges are expected to be reclassified.</p>



<p>The inquiry has been handed to the criminal investigation service in Hauts-de-Seine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>More research on the threats of artificial intelligence (AI) &#8220;needs to be done urgently&#8221;, the boss of Google DeepMind has told BBC News.</p>



<p>In an exclusive interview at the AI Impact Summit in Delhi, Sir Demis Hassabis said the industry wanted &#8220;smart regulation&#8221; for &#8220;the real risks&#8221; posed by the tech.</p>



<p>Many tech leaders and politicians at the Summit have called for more global governance of AI, ahead of an expected joint statement as the event draws to a close.</p>



<p>But the US has rejected this stance, with White House technology adviser Michael Kratsios saying: &#8220;AI adoption cannot lead to a brighter future if it is subject to bureaucracies and centralised control.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sir Demis said it was important to build &#8220;robust guardrails&#8221; against the most serious threats from the rise of autonomous systems.</p>



<p>He said the two main threats were the technology being used by &#8220;bad actors&#8221;, and the risk of losing control of systems as they become more powerful.</p>



<p>When asked whether he had the power to slow down the progress of the tech to give experts more time to work on its challenges, he said his firm had an important role to play, but was &#8220;only one player in the ecosystem&#8221;.</p>



<p>But he admitted keeping up with the pace of AI development was &#8220;the hard thing&#8221; for regulators.</p>



<p>Sam Altman, the boss of OpenAI, also called for &#8220;urgent regulation&#8221; in a speech at the AI Summit, while Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi said countries had to work together to benefit from AI.</p>



<p>However, the US has taken the opposite view. &#8220;As the Trump administration has now said many times: We totally reject global governance of AI,&#8221; said the head of the US delegation Michael Kratsios.</p>

<p>Delegates from more than 100 countries, including several world leaders, are attending the event. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy MP represented the UK government.</p>



<p>Mr Lammy said the power wasn&#8217;t just with tech firms when it came to safety of AI and politicians need to work &#8220;hand in hand&#8221; with tech adding, &#8220;security and safety must come first and it must be of benefit for the wider public&#8221;.</p>



<p>Sir Demis believes the US and the west are &#8220;slightly&#8221; ahead in the race with China for AI dominance but added that it could be &#8220;only a matter of months&#8221; before China catches up.</p>



<p>He said he felt the responsibility to balance being &#8220;bold and responsible&#8221; about deploying AI systems out in the world.</p>



<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t always get things right,&#8221; he admitted, &#8220;but we get it more correct than most&#8221;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Science education &#8216;still very important&#8217;</h2>



<p>In the next 10 years the tech would become &#8220;a superpower&#8221; in terms of what people would be able to create, Sir Demis, who won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s still very important to have a Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) education,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you have a technical background, I think it will still be an advantage in using these systems.&#8221;</p>



<p>He thinks AI writing code would open up the number of people who could build new applications, &#8220;and then maybe the key thing becomes taste and creativity and judgement&#8221;.</p>



<p>The AI Impact Summit is the largest ever global gathering of world leaders and tech bosses.</p>



<p>It ends on Friday with companies and countries expected to deliver a shared view of how to handle artificial intelligence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Gender Centre for Empowering Development (GenCED) has condemned what it describes as escalating cyberbullying and digital harassment targeting women in Ghana’s Parliament.</p>



<p>It warned that such attacks undermine democratic participation and discourage women from public service.</p>



<p>In a statement, the Centre expressed concern over online abuse directed at Millicent Amankwah Yeboah, Member of Parliament for Sunyani West, saying the attacks seek to demean her competence and dignity through ridicule of her speech and personal insults.</p>



<p>According to GenCED, the sustained online hostility reflects deep-seated gender bias and risks silencing women in leadership.</p>



<p>“This sustained online hostility, often framed as ridicule for speech and rhetorical style, reflects deep-seated gender bias and has the effect of discouraging women from full and confident participation in democratic discourse,” the statement said.</p>



<div data-wp-interactive="core/file" class="wp-block-file"><object data-wp-bind--hidden="!state.hasPdfPreview" hidden class="wp-block-file__embed" data="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LATEST.pdf" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%;height:600px" aria-label="Embed of LATEST."></object><a id="wp-block-file--media-26e11710-7267-46d6-9663-5a1d99eae101" href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LATEST.pdf">LATEST</a><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LATEST.pdf" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-26e11710-7267-46d6-9663-5a1d99eae101" download>Download</a></div>



<p>The organisation warned that the growing trend of online harassment, including derogatory comments, personal insults and threats, not only harms individuals but also signals to women and girls that their voices are unwelcome in public life.</p>



<p>GenCED cited recent data to highlight the scale of the problem. Monitoring by the Media Foundation for West Africa recorded 583 incidents of online gender-based violence targeting women, including female politicians and public figures, between August 2024 and March 2025 across major social media platforms.</p>



<p>National data from the Cyber Security Authority also shows cybercrime cases rising sharply in Ghana, with cyberbullying ranking among the top reported offences and accounting for hundreds of complaints in 2025 alone. In addition, a poll by UNICEF’s U-Report found that 49% of young people in Ghana have experienced online violence, often resulting in emotional distress.</p>



<p>The Centre noted that such patterns of abuse threaten democratic inclusion by intimidating women in public office and undermining equal participation in governance.</p>



<p>GenCED further pointed to Ghana’s legal framework, which recognises cyber harassment as a punishable offence. The Cyber Crimes Act, 2025 criminalises online harassment and cyberbullying, including the use of digital platforms to humiliate or insult individuals, with penalties including fines or imprisonment. It said additional protections are provided under the Cybersecurity Act, 2020 (Act 1038) and related electronic communications laws.</p>



<p>Despite these provisions, the organisation argued that enforcement remains weak, allowing online gender-based abuse to continue with little accountability.</p>



<p>The Centre stressed that cyberbullying against elected officials, particularly on the basis of gender or language, constitutes gender-based political violence and has no place in a democratic society. It called on political parties, state institutions, media organisations and online platforms to uphold standards of respect, dignity and equality in digital engagement.</p>



<p>GenCED urged law enforcement and regulatory bodies to apply cybercrime laws decisively against perpetrators, while calling on parliamentary leadership to publicly condemn online abuse targeting MPs and support measures to protect digital civic space. It also encouraged media organisations and online platforms to strengthen moderation systems and promote digital literacy.</p>



<p>The organisation further appealed to Ghanaian citizens to reject misogynistic attacks online and instead promote constructive debate focused on policy rather than personal attacks.</p>



<p>It emphasised that Millicent Amankwah Yeboah, like all elected representatives, has a constitutional mandate to serve her constituents without fear of digital intimidation, adding that Ghana’s democracy is strengthened by diverse voices and respectful public discourse.</p>

<p>The Ghana Police Service in Birim North, in collaboration with the Blue Water Guards and forestry officials, has intercepted a group of illegal chainsaw operators in a forest within the district.</p>



<p>The joint operation, conducted at dawn, forms part of ongoing efforts to curb illegal logging and protect the area’s forest reserves. Authorities acted on information from community members who reported suspicious activity deep inside the forest.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Three Cameroonian soldiers have been sentenced to prison for their role in the killing of at least 21 civilians in the country's troubled Anglophone region.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Three Cameroonian soldiers have been sentenced to prison for their role in the killing of at least 21 civilians in the country&#8217;s troubled Anglophone region.</p>



<p>The jail terms for the crimes, which took place six years ago in the Northwest region, range from five to 10 years per person.</p>



<p>A military court previously found the soldiers guilty of murder, arson and destruction &#8211; a rare occurrence in a country where military personnel are seldom convicted of crimes against civilians.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, lawyers for the victims told the BBC they were disappointed with the length of the jail terms handed down on Thursday, calling them &#8220;insignificant&#8221;.</p>



<p>The convictions centre on the events of 14 February 2020, when soldiers, supported by a local militia of ethnic Fulanis, raided the village of Ngarbuh and killed civilians.</p>



<p>The victims included 13 children, according to Human Rights Watch, who added that the assailants burnt down homes and beat up residents.</p>



<p>What followed was a rare instance of Cameroon&#8217;s government acknowledging the atrocities of its soldiers in the Anglophone regions, which have been wracked by a separatist conflict for nearly 10 years.</p>



<p>The authorities initially denied responsibility for the attack on Ngarbuh but later backpedalled following international pressure and the findings of an investigation ordered by the country&#8217;s President, Paul Biya.</p>



<p>Alongside the three soldiers sentenced on Thursday evening, a militia member also received a jail term for murder, arson and destruction.</p>



<p>One of the victims&#8217; lawyers, Sother Menkem, told the BBC: &#8220;The sentence was so mild, I even qualify it as friendly because we are talking of a massacre.&#8221;</p>



<p>Menkem pointed out that under Cameroonian law, the minimum sentence for felonies such as murder and arson is 10 years.</p>



<p>&#8220;I expected at least 30 years&#8217; imprisonment or more because [the soldiers] instilled much fear on the inhabitants of that area,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>The soldiers&#8217; lawyers argued that their clients were merely doing their job.</p>



<p>A man who lost several relatives in the February 2020 attack told the BBC he needed time to process the court&#8217;s decision.</p>



<p>He has since moved out of the conflict-hit region for safety reasons.</p>



<p>The military court rejected the victims&#8217; demand for compensation, a move decried by another of their lawyers, Richard Tamfu.</p>



<p>Human Rights Watch and legal representatives of the victims have insisted that the soldiers were acting on the instructions from their superiors and therefore criticise the fact that no senior military officer was prosecuted at the trial.</p>



<p>The case dragged on for six years after hearings were postponed multiple times.</p>



<p>Since 2017, separatist fighters in the country&#8217;s two English-speaking regions have been campaigning for the creation of a breakaway state.</p>



<p>Human rights groups have accused both the rebels and state forces of committing widespread abuses.</p>



<p>The UN says the conflict has killed at least 6,000 people and forced over half a million others to flee their homes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A 33-year-old trader who allegedly stole a four-day-old baby at the Mamprobi Polyclinic in Accra has been remanded by the Domestic Violence and Victims Support Unit Court in Accra.</p>



<p>Latifa Salifu, a mother of two, has been charged with one count of child stealing before the court presided over by K. K. Obiri Yeboah.</p>



<p>Her plea in respect of the charge was not taken as investigations are still ongoing.</p>



<p>The prosecution, led by Chief Inspector Opoku Aniagyei, told the court that investigations were still ongoing and prayed for the accused to be remanded in custody.</p>



<p>“We want the accused to be remanded to allow us to complete our investigations,” he said.</p>



<p>However, counsel for the accused, Hamisu Muhammad, pleaded with the court to grant his client bail, arguing that Salifu was not a flight risk and had never had a brush with the law.</p>



<p>“My client will not interfere with police investigations and witnesses because she does not have the resources to interfere and does not have the resources to abscond,” the counsel submitted.</p>



<p>He added that his client had men who were ready to stand in as sureties.</p>



<p>The prosecution opposed the bail application, indicating that police suspected the alleged theft may have been orchestrated by a syndicate.</p>



<p>“There is no sense that the accused, who has children who are boys, will still go to the hospital to steal a boy.</p>



<p>“We want the accused remanded to help with investigations,” the prosecutor said.</p>



<p>The judge sided with the prosecution and remanded the accused to reappear on March 4, 2026.</p>



<p><strong>Prosecution’s case</strong></p>



<p>Narrating the facts, Chief Inspector Aniagyei said that on February 14 this year, the mother of the four-day-old baby delivered at the hospital through a caesarean section.</p>



<p>He said the baby was subsequently referred to the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital for further treatment.</p>



<p>On February 17, 2026, while the mother was at the recovery ward, the prosecutor said a woman dressed in a peach-coloured scrub uniform posed as a nurse, came to her bed, looked at the baby and the mother, and left.</p>



<p>Later that day, at about 4 p.m., the accused allegedly returned to the mother under the pretext of administering medicine to the baby.</p>



<p>About 10 minutes later, Chief Inspector Aniagyei said a nurse approached the mother to ask about the baby, but she informed the nurse that the accused had taken the child and described her appearance.</p>



<p>He said nurses on duty searched the hospital premises but could not find the accused.</p>



<p>The complainant subsequently lodged a report with the Mamprobi Police.</p>



<p>On February 18, 2026, a whistleblower informed the Dansoman Police that the accused had been seen with the baby at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital.</p>



<p>“With the help of the Dansoman Police patrol team, the accused was arrested and brought to the Police station together with the baby.</p>



<p>“The accused in her Police investigation caution statement admitted the offence and stated that she went to pick up the baby from the victim under the pretext of administering medicine for her and bolted with the baby,” the prosecutor told the court.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The United States Embassy in Ghana has cautioned Ghanaian football fans planning to travel to the United States for this year’s World Cup not to overstay their authorised period of stay.</p>



<p>At a news conference in Accra on Friday, February 20, Chargé d’Affaires Rolf Olson stressed that securing a visa and purchasing a match ticket do not exempt visitors from complying with American immigration laws.</p>



<p>He stated that every country enforces its own immigration regulations and expects visitors to abide by them.</p>



<p>“I think it’s important to clarify something. Every country has its immigration practices and laws. And this is certainly true of Ghana as well,” he said. </p>



<p>“When a government issues a visa to a visitor for whatever purpose, for whatever length of time, it’s really incumbent upon that visitor to respect the laws of the country that they are in. And that’s both in terms of their conduct in the country, as well as how long they stay.”</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XmLD6VomZX0?si=CSFo8LIF4748FgiY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>Mr. Olson explained that a visa does not automatically guarantee entry or determine how long a visitor may remain in the United States. Rather, he noted, the visa permits a traveller to board a flight and seek admission at a U.S. port of entry.</p>



<p>“The visa itself is a permission to apply for entry at the port of entry. So the visa allows you to get on the plane. Without the visa, the airline won’t let you travel,” he said. </p>



<p>“You get to the border at the airport… it is the Customs and Border Patrol officer who then officially grants you entry into the country. It is that individual who will determine how long you have to stay.”</p>



<p>According to him, while the standard period for a B visa is generally six months, the duration is not automatic and may be shorter, depending on the decision of the Customs and Border Protection officer.</p>



<p>“If they give you 90 days, you have 90 days. If you have the six months, six months is a long time. And I think we can all agree that six months is enough time to go watch the World Cup matches, spend some time with friends, go on a vacation if you want to do that, and still return,” he said.</p>



<p>He further reminded applicants that although Ghanaian travellers often receive five-year multiple-entry visas, that validity is not guaranteed and remains at the discretion of the consular officer.</p>



<p>“There is no automatic five-year multiple-entry. But that is generally the standard, and we generally apply that for most travellers,” he noted, adding that visitors who comply with visa terms would have opportunities to travel again in the future.</p>



<p>Mr. Olson disclosed that he has engaged Ghanaian authorities on the expected travel arrangements for the tournament and urged prospective travellers not to abuse the opportunity.</p>



<p>“We very, very strongly encourage people and expect people who are granted a visa to go to the U.S. and observe the terms of that visa, from the length of time they’re there to what they’re actually doing,” he said. </p>



<p>“People who have exceeded the terms of their visa are breaking the law. And needless to say, we take that very seriously in the United States.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As the world observes World Day of Social Justice today, under the compelling theme “Empowering Inclusion: Bridging Gaps for Social Justice”, the Christian Council of Ghana (CCG) has expressed solemn solidarity with the global call to dismantle barriers of exclusion, inequality, and marginalisation.</p>



<p>The Council emphasises that this commitment is not only a civic duty but also a moral obligation and a profound expression of faith. Citing Psalm 89:14 — “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; love and faithfulness go before you” — the CCG draws a direct connection between divine principles and Ghana’s cherished national motto, “Freedom and Justice”, emblazoned upon the country’s Coat of Arms since independence. </p>



<div data-wp-interactive="core/file" class="wp-block-file"><object data-wp-bind--hidden="!state.hasPdfPreview" hidden class="wp-block-file__embed" data="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CCG_WORLD-DAY-OF-SOCIAL-JUSTICE_2026-2.pdf" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%;height:600px" aria-label="Embed of CCG_WORLD DAY OF SOCIAL JUSTICE_2026 (2)."></object><a id="wp-block-file--media-41a44f3b-01df-4711-9472-982d5ef50585" href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CCG_WORLD-DAY-OF-SOCIAL-JUSTICE_2026-2.pdf">CCG_WORLD DAY OF SOCIAL JUSTICE_2026 (2)</a><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CCG_WORLD-DAY-OF-SOCIAL-JUSTICE_2026-2.pdf" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-41a44f3b-01df-4711-9472-982d5ef50585" download>Download</a></div>



<p>This motto, inscribed by forebears emerging from colonial oppression, symbolises a covenantal aspiration: genuine freedom from bondage and just treatment for every citizen, irrespective of socioeconomic status or religious background.</p>



<p>In contemporary Ghana, the pursuit of empowering inclusion reflects this sacred alignment. Bridging societal gaps involves extending the freedoms promised in the national motto to those still constrained by poverty, discrimination, unemployment, disability, gender inequality, rural neglect, and inadequate social protection. </p>



<p>For the CCG, justice must be a lived reality, ensuring that widows, orphans, strangers, youth, and the elderly experience the dignity intended by God (Deuteronomy 10:18; Isaiah 1:17).</p>



<p>On this World Day of Social Justice, the Council has called upon the Government of Ghana and all stakeholders in nation-building to address systemic discrimination, economic disparity, and governance challenges that hinder inclusive prosperity. </p>



<p>The CCG also hopes that the Global South will witness true freedom and justice grounded in collective welfare, rather than the interests of a privileged few.</p>

<p>The Council commended President Mahama for his dedication to social justice through initiatives such as the National Apprenticeship Programme, MahamaCares (Ghana Medical Trust Fund), No-Fees-Stress Initiative, free tertiary education for persons with disabilities, free sanitary pads distribution, the Adwumawura Programme, expansion of the LEAP Programme, and free primary healthcare. </p>



<p>While acknowledging these policies as commendable, the CCG stressed that their effective and equitable implementation is crucial to benefit all intended recipients, fostering a just, progressive, and prosperous society.</p>



<p>Despite these efforts, the Council noted that government action alone cannot fully achieve social justice. On this occasion, the CCG called on the religious community and development partners, including the United Nations (UN), to collaborate in promoting social justice, particularly in regions where race, gender, sexuality, or economic status hinder access to fundamental rights and social services.</p>



<p>The Council specifically highlighted the persistent challenge of “no bed syndrome” in healthcare as an affront to social justice. Every Ghanaian and resident of Ghana, it asserted, deserves timely emergency care to realise their God-given potential.</p>



<p>Coming on the third day of Lent, a period of penitence, reflection, and beneficence, the Council urged citizens to embody the principles of Isaiah 58:1–12 by acting justly and compassionately towards the poor, vulnerable, and socially disadvantaged.</p>



<p>The CCG prayed that the observance of World Day of Social Justice, celebrated globally under the auspices of the United Nations, would bring humanity closer to its divine calling to be one another’s keeper. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The New Juaben South Metropolitan Chief Executive (MCE), Ransford Owusu Boakye, has visited the family of Constance Nyarko, a native of Srodae in Koforidua, who fell victim to the recent tragic terrorist attack in Burkina Faso that claimed eight Ghanaian lives.</p>



<p>Constance, affectionately known as Yaa Yaa, was among a group of Ghanaian traders travelling through northern Burkina Faso when they were ambushed by suspected insurgents.</p>



<p>During his visit, Mr. Boakye extended heartfelt condolences to the grieving family and assured them that the government would provide support for her burial arrangements.</p>



<p>Speaking to Adom News, Yaa Agyeiwaa, mother of the deceased, said Constance was the family’s sole breadwinner and left behind two children, making the loss particularly devastating.</p>



<p>Members of the Juaben Sewaa Market community, including tomato sellers, also expressed their sympathies and urged authorities to strengthen security for traders traveling abroad.</p>



<p>The incident has deeply affected the community, who remember Constance for her resilience, dedication, and hardworking nature.</p>



<p>Ransford Owusu Boakye reaffirmed the government’s commitment to supporting the family during this difficult time.</p>

<p>Cocoa farmers have picketed the headquarters of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) in Accra, intensifying protests over falling producer prices and delayed payments that they say are pushing farming households into economic distress.</p>



<p>Carrying placards and chanting slogans, the farmers accused authorities of failing to honour commitments to protect their livelihoods. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="http://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WhatsApp-Video-2026-02-20-at-5.10.53-PM.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Some of the inscriptions on Friday, February 20, read: “We worked, you lied,” “Government celebrates but our families mourn,” and “We can’t pay our kids’ school fees,” among others.</p>

<p>The messages captured the depth of frustration among farmers who say their incomes have been eroded despite their role in sustaining one of Ghana’s most critical export sectors.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="http://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WhatsApp-Video-2026-02-20-at-5.06.16-PM.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>The protesters are demanding an urgent upward review of the cocoa producer price and the settlement of outstanding payments owed to them by Licensed Buying Companies operating under COCOBOD’s supervision.</p>

<p>&#8220;The prices were not reduced under the previous regimes; why is this administration reducing it. We have no problem with the government, they should just leave the prices to remain the same,&#8221; a frustrated woman told journalists.</p>

<p>According to the farmers, delays in payment and the recent downward adjustment in cocoa prices have made it increasingly difficult to cover basic household needs, including school fees, healthcare, and farm maintenance.</p>



<p>“We depend entirely on cocoa. When payments delay or prices drop, our families suffer,” one protester said, adding that many farmers are struggling to prepare for the next crop season due to lack of funds.</p>

<p>The demonstration at COCOBOD headquarters follows similar protests in cocoa-growing regions, particularly in the Western North Region, where farmers marched through major towns to protest the reduced farmgate price.</p>

<p>The unrest comes amid broader challenges facing Ghana’s cocoa sector, including global price volatility, declining output in some regions, and financial pressures on COCOBOD. </p>



<p>Although COCOBOD has announced payments to Licensed Buying Companies to facilitate farmer payments, many producers say the relief has yet to reach them at the farmgate level.</p>

<p>Farmer groups warn that without immediate intervention, many producers may abandon cocoa farming altogether or reduce investment in their farms, potentially affecting future production levels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President John Mahama has announced that the government’s ban on the export of non-ferrous scrap is expected to boost Ghana’s processed metal exports by between &#8220;$250 million and $300 million annually&#8221;, describing the move as a decisive step toward strengthening the country’s industrial base.</p>



<p>Speaking at the commissioning of the B5 Plus Limited Steel Manufacturing Plant at Prampram on Friday, February 20, the President said the policy is designed to secure raw materials for local manufacturers and accelerate value addition in the metals industry.</p>



<p>He explained that Ghana generates substantial volumes of scrap metal each year through construction, demolition, vehicle imports and other industrial activities. However, for years, a significant portion of that scrap has been exported in its raw form.</p>



<p>“Industrial capacity requires raw material security. By restricting non-ferrous scrap exports, the government ensures local processors have priority access to raw material for their production,” he said.</p>



<p>According to him, the policy will not only increase processed metal exports but also create between 5,000 and 10,000 new jobs across the value chain.</p>



<p>President Mahama added that the move would further enhance domestic revenue mobilisation through value-added tax, corporate taxes and pay-as-you-earn contributions.</p>



<p>He commended B5 Plus Group for its tax compliance, noting that the company is among the Ghana Revenue Authority’s most reliable taxpayers. </p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve paid more than $300 million in taxes and are looking to exceed $500 million very soon.&#8221;</p>



<p>While acknowledging concerns raised by the company over frequent audits, he suggested that regulatory oversight must be balanced and predictable.</p>



<p>The President said the broader objective is to move Ghana up the value chain by exporting finished and semi-finished products rather than raw scrap materials.</p>



<p>Linking the policy to the government’s “Big Push” infrastructure agenda, he said massive investments in roads, highways, railway modernisation, bridges, interchanges, energy transmission lines, affordable housing and industrial parks will require a strong and reliable supply of iron and steel.</p>



<p>&#8220;Africa is projected to require over $100 billion annually in infrastructure development. West Africa alone faces significant infrastructure deficits. </p>



<p>&#8220;If Ghana develops a strong steel base, we not only build our own roads and bridges, we will also supply steel to the whole sub-region. This is how infrastructure becomes industrial strategy. The 24-hour economy program is particularly relevant to energy-intensive industries such as steel manufacturing,&#8221; President Mahama added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Growth in the US slowed at the end of last year, as consumer spending slackened and the federal government shut down.</p>



<p>The world&#8217;s largest economy grew at an annual pace of 1.4%% in the three months to December, falling back from a robust 4.4% in the prior quarter.</p>



<p>It capped a turbulent year for the US economy, which has been buffeted by new tariffs, a crackdown on immigration, cuts to government spending and persistent inflation.</p>



<p>Overall, the economy grew 2.2% in 2025, performing better than many had anticipated in the face of those pressures.</p>



<p>&#8220;The core of the economy is resilient,&#8221; Michael Pearce, chief US economist at Oxford Economics wrote on Friday, adding that he expected growth to pick up again this year.</p>



<p>Despite the underlying momentum, sharp swings in trade policy last year sent the economic data on a roller coaster ride.</p>



<p>The year started in a mild contraction, fuelled in part by a jump in imports &#8211; which subtract from growth in calculations of gross domestic product (GDP) &#8211; as firms rushed goods into the country ahead of anticipated tariffs.</p>



<p>Growth bounced back in the spring and summer, as foreign imports slowed, before decelerating again in the final months of the year, as imports started to recover.</p>



<p>The release of trade data on Thursday &#8211; which showed the trade deficit widening in December &#8211; had prompted a flurry of last-minute, downward revisions to growth forecasts for the October-December period.</p>



<p>But the slowdown was still more severe than many economists had anticipated.</p>



<p>While private investment picked up, it remained largely concentrated in intellectual property and IT-related equipment.</p>



<p>Consumer spending rose 2.4%, cooling from 3.5% in the prior quarter.</p>



<p>Government spending plunged more than 16%.</p>



<p>&#8220;The government shutdown ended up being a much bigger drag on the economy&#8221; than other data had suggested, Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics wrote in a note. He said he expected that decline to be reversed in the months ahead.</p>



<p>Before publication of the report, US President Donald Trump tried to temper expectations, pointing to the shutdown, which he blamed on Democrats. He said it &#8220;cost the USA at least two points in GDP&#8221;.</p>



<p>In its report, the Commerce Department estimated that losses from the suspension of federal government services had subtracted one percentage point from GDP in the fourth quarter, while noting that the full impact was likely larger.</p>



<p>A separate report showed an uptick in the measure of inflation preferred by the US central bank &#8211; the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. It hit 2.9% in December, up from 2.8% in the prior month.</p>



<p>While analysts said the fourth quarter slowdown was unlikely to cause significant alarm, given the role of the shutdown, they said the inflation figure could give Federal Reserve officials pause.</p>



<p>&#8220;This PCE report is a reality check,&#8221; Olu Sonola, head of US economics at Fitch Ratings wrote in a note. He added that the figures could undercut arguments for the bank to start lowering interest rates again this year.</p>



<p>&#8220;The market may be pricing multiple cuts this year—but the Fed&#8217;s preferred inflation gauge is telling policymakers, &#8216;Not yet&#8217;,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The Chief Executive Officer of the Social Investment Fund (SIF), Lawyer Abass Nurudeen, says the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) has accepted the Chief Justice’s ruling dismissing the petition against the Electoral Commission Chairperson and her deputies.</p>



<p>Chief Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie has ruled that there is no prima facie case to proceed with petitions seeking the removal of the Electoral Commission Chair, Jean Mensa, and her deputies, Dr. Bossman Eric Asare and Samuel Tettey.</p>



<p>The decision was confirmed in a statement issued on Wednesday, February 18, by the Minister of Government Communications.</p>



<p>Reacting to the ruling on Kumasi-based&nbsp;<strong>Nhyria FM’s “Kro Yi Mu Nsem</strong>“, Abass Nurudeen said NDC supporters are disappointed with the ruling, but the party will respect the decision.</p>



<p>Abass, who is also the Ashanti Regional Communications Director of the NDC, appealed to party faithful to stay calm, emphasizing the party’s commitment to democratic values despite their disappointment with the ruling.</p>



<p>“I’ll urge them to stay calm and understand that being in government doesn’t automatically guarantee favorable outcomes in every case,” he said.</p>



<p>He reiterated that the EC Chair and her deputies lack competence, pointing to the numerous mistakes they made with the presidential results during the 2020 general elections.</p>



<p>He claimed that EC officials failed to learn from their 2020 general election mistakes, repeating them in the 2024 elections, specifically citing the Akwatia and Kpandai parliamentary election results processes.</p>



<p>He warned that if the Electoral Commission continues to make such mistakes, it could lead to conflict, posing a danger to the nation.</p>



<p>“As an NDC member, I think Madam Jean Mensah, Dr. Bossman Eric Asare, and Samuel Tettey shouldn’t remain in their EC positions, given what happened in the 2020 and 2024 general elections. These petitions should be a wake-up call for them.”</p>



<p>Dr. Henry Kwabena Kokofu, a former EPA Executive Director and NPP stalwart, hailed the Chief Justice’s ruling on the petition against the EC bosses and OSP as a victory for Ghana’s democracy.</p>



<p>He said everyone is guided by the Constitution, so if the Chief Justice and the Supreme Court have ruled based on it, then that is the way to go.</p>



<p>When asked whether he trusts the judiciary under Baffoe-Bonnie, he said he has had trust in Chief Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie for a long time.</p>



<p>“I’ve had trust in Chief Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie for a long time, but it’s not because of his ruling on the petition against the EC bosses and OSP,” he told the host, Barima Kofi Dawson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minority Caucus in Parliament has accused the administration of President John Dramani Mahama of presiding over what it describes as a significant decline in revenue performance, warning that fiscal consolidation claims do not reflect the underlying realities.</p>



<p>In a statement signed by Frank Annoh-Dompreh, Minority Chief Whip, the Caucus asserted that the government inherited a revenue-to-GDP ratio of 16 per cent but had seen it fall to 11 per cent by the third quarter of last year.</p>



<p>The statement described this as “a loss of approximately five per cent of GDP in revenue performance”, which it said explains expenditure constraints, salary arrears, and funding backlogs across the public sector.</p>



<p>“Fiscal discipline built on collapsing revenue is not reform; it is institutional contraction and state weakness,” the Minority declared.</p>



<p>It argued that while the government speaks of consolidation and prudence, the shrinking revenue base undermines the state’s capacity to deliver essential services and sustain development commitments.</p>



<p>The Caucus further contended that sterilisation policies aimed at curbing inflation have compounded economic hardship.</p>



<p>It pointed to the withdrawal of over GH¢60 billion from circulation, as acknowledged in the 2026 Budget, stating that this has constrained liquidity and dampened economic activity.</p>



<p>“What citizens are experiencing is not macroeconomic stability, but deliberate economic dryness,” the statement read.</p>



<p>The Minority concluded that economic management must prioritise structural growth and revenue expansion rather than contractionary measures.</p>



<p>“Governance must be grounded in sustainability and long-term resilience,” the statement emphasised, cautioning against what it termed short-term optics at the expense of enduring reform.</p>

<p>The Minority Caucus has expressed concern that Ghana is returning to what it describes as dangerous over-reliance on commodity prices to sustain economic stability.</p>



<p>In its latest statement, the Caucus warned that improvements in macroeconomic indicators are being driven largely by global gold prices rather than domestic structural reforms.</p>



<p>The statement commended the Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana) for initiating a one-year performance review of the Mahama administration, but urged civil society groups to examine “methods, costs and sustainability” beyond headline figures.</p>



<p>“Without subjecting recent developments to these three tests, national discourse is reduced to slogans, not governance,” the Minority stated.</p>



<p>On the cocoa sector, the Caucus claimed farmers are losing more than GH¢1,000 per bag due to structural changes in trading systems and the removal of stabilisation and hedging buffers.</p>



<p>“Economic resets that shift global market risks onto vulnerable farmers are not reforms; they are policy injustice,” the statement said, adding that the Minority had formally demanded corrective measures.</p>



<p>The Caucus further criticised what it termed declining fiscal performance, alleging that revenue-to-GDP ratios had dropped from 16 per cent to 11 per cent by the third quarter of last year.</p>



<p>It argued that fiscal consolidation “built on collapsing revenue is not reform; it is institutional contraction and state weakness”.</p>



<p>Ending on a cautionary note, the Minority stated that “this is not economic resilience; it is renewed commodity dependence and a return to old structural vulnerabilities”.</p>



<p>It urged continuous and technical national accountability, insisting that “Ghana deserves methods that work, costs that are justified, and sustainable policies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Parliament was thrown into a heated debate as Members of Parliament traded accusations and counter-accusations over the recent terrorist attack in Burkina Faso that claimed the lives of eight Ghanaian tomato traders.</p>



<p>The Minority side demanded urgent action, calling for a Parliamentary inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the killings, as well as state compensation and support for the families of the victims.</p>



<p>Raising the issue on the floor of Parliament, the Deputy Ranking Member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Nana Asafo Adjei-Ayeh, questioned whether Ghanaian authorities had acted on intelligence warnings and demanded accountability.</p>



<p>“The Minority demands the following: an immediate parliamentary enquiry into the circumstances surrounding this tragedy, including whether prior intelligence warnings existed and what steps, if any, were taken to protect Ghanaian traders operating in high-risk zones. Full compensation and state support for the families of the deceased and the injured,” he said.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/ghanaians-death-toll-in-burkina-faso-terror-attack-now-8/">Read also: Ghanaians death toll in Burkina Faso terror attack now 8</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Ranking Member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Samuel Abu Jinapor, further argued that Ghanaian civilians had been exposed to danger following heightened security risks in Burkina Faso, stressing that the victims were non-combatants.</p>



<p>“The president of Burkina Faso, General Ibrahim Traore, became a special guest at the inauguration of President Mahama, and I&#8217;m not saying it, security experts indicated, Mr. Speaker, that Ghanaians were going to become targets.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OgLYRujM1sE?si=R7AEXtpT2sut9Gm2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>&#8220;And indeed, these traders, Mr. Speaker, let&#8217;s ask ourselves the fundamental question. These traders are not combatants. These traders do not play any role in the conflict in Burkina Faso,” Mr Jinapor added.</p>



<p>However, the debate quickly took a political turn when National Democratic Congress (NDC) MP Samuel Atta Mills shifted focus to domestic agricultural policy, accusing the previous government of failing northern farming communities through the stalled Pwalugu irrigation project.</p>



<p>“Your former flagbearer, who&#8217;s now your new flagbearer, went on TV and said the best thing he has ever done in the north was the Pwalugu &nbsp;Dam. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/govt-engages-burkina-faso-over-safety-of-ghanaian-tomato-traders-dumelo/">Read also: Govt engages Burkina Faso over safety of Ghanaian tomato traders — Dumelo</a></li>
</ul>



<p>&#8220;This Pwalugu Dam was supposed to help us irrigate the land and grow tomatoes in the north. We spent about $12 million, and we have nothing to show for it. If this dam had been built, we would be able to grow our tomatoes up north,” he argued.</p>



<p>The comments drew strong opposition from the Minority, prompting a response from Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin, who rejected allegations of financial abuse and challenged the government on its economic promises.</p>



<p>“The honorable member, who is the majority leader, is a lawyer, and he knows. I challenge him to come out with any evidence to suggest or point to a person who has abused any so-called money. </p>



<p>&#8220;Mr. Speaker, his party is in government. Where is their 24-hour economy? Where is the one job, three shifts? If you create jobs in Pwalugu, it will help the poor in that part of the region,&#8221; Mr Afenyo-Markin asked.</p>



<p>Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga escalated the exchange, linking the tragedy directly to the failure of the irrigation project.</p>



<p>“If the Pwalugu multipurpose dam had been constructed, the women will not be going to Burkina Faso. When you take $12 million dollars to do irrigation for them, do the irrigation. </p>



<p>&#8220;You chop the money and drove the women into Burkina Faso to buy tomatoes, and they went and died there. And you want to come and do politics in this chamber,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minority Caucus in Parliament has cautioned that what the government describes as economic stability under President John Dramani Mahama is largely “manufactured” and unsustainable.</p>



<p>In a statement issued during a civil society assessment of the administration, the Caucus argued that democracy must be anchored in “accountability, evidence, and truth” rather than “propaganda, symbolism, and headline management”.</p>



<p>The statement, signed by Frank Annoh-Dompreh, Minority Chief Whip, criticised the government’s handling of currency stability.</p>



<p>According to the Minority, the relative calm in the foreign exchange market has been achieved through “aggressive forex market intervention and depletion of Ghana’s hard-earned gold reserves.”</p>



<p>The Caucus warned that “stability achieved through reserve exhaustion is not success; it is deferred economic collapse”.</p>



<p>It further alleged that more than $10 billion was spent in 2025 alone on market interventions, raising concerns about the opportunity cost of depleted reserves.</p>



<p>The Minority also expressed alarm over suggestions that gold sourced from illegal mining operations could be entering the national value chain to support foreign exchange operations, describing the environmental and health implications as “a major source of worry”.</p>



<p>On inflation, the Caucus claimed that government measures had created “economic suffocation disguised as discipline.”</p>



<p>It cited the 2026 Budget’s admission that over GH¢60 billion had been withdrawn from circulation through sterilisation policies, arguing that such measures have suppressed liquidity, weakened credit markets, and constrained business growth. “Inflation control that destroys economic life is not discipline; it is economic suffocation,” the statement declared.</p>



<p>Concluding, the Minority insisted that governance must be grounded in structural reform and sustainability.</p>



<p>“Ghana cannot build its future on a currency peg sustained by structural economic weakening,” the statement read, adding that “stability without sustainability is deception; growth without structure is collapse in waiting”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) Ghana and National Chairman of the General Transport, Petroleum and Chemical Workers Union, Bernard Owusu, has strongly condemned the recent salary reductions imposed on Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) workers.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on&nbsp;<em><strong>Adom FM’s morning show Dwaso Nsem</strong></em>, Mr. Owusu questioned the logic behind making workers bear the brunt of declining global cocoa prices.</p>



<p>“We will not accept salary cuts because of declining world cocoa prices. The COCOBOD worker did not set international cocoa prices. The worker does not control the global market. The worker is not responsible for economic mismanagement. So why must the worker suffer?” he said.</p>



<p>Mr. Owusu stressed the stark income disparity between management and workers.</p>



<p>“When CEOs earn GH₵200,000 a month, and workers earn GH₵10,000–20,000, the gap is clear. Yet in difficult times, it is the worker they want to sacrifice,” he stated.</p>



<p>The TUC chairman also said the cuts appear to violate existing agreements.</p>



<p>“The imposed salary reductions are contrary to our Collective Bargaining Agreement. Salary matters must be negotiated with the recognized unions—not imposed unilaterally. COCOBOD workers are not shock absorbers,” Owusu warned.</p>



<p>He listed the union’s demands, stressing fairness and transparency.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TUC-ON-COCOBOD-PAY-CUT-1.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>“We demand respect for the CBA, proper union engagement, full transparency, and shared responsibility. An injury to one is an injury to all. Solidarity forever.”</p>



<p>His comments follow COCOBOD’s announcement that Executive Management would take a 20% pay cut, while Senior Staff accepted a 10% reduction for the remainder of the 2025/26 crop year, citing liquidity challenges in the cocoa industry.</p>



<p>But Mr. Owusu reiterated that workers should not be made to pay for circumstances beyond their control.</p>



<p>“We call on COCOBOD and government authorities to ensure that workers are protected and that their rights under the union agreements are respected,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana&#8217;s emergency care system is at a defining moment. For years, the phrase &#8220;no bed syndrome&#8221; has echoed across the country, symbolising the frustration of families who watch critically ill patients being turned away from multiple hospitals. But the deeper truth is this: the crisis is not simply about the number of beds. It is about how the system functions.</p>



<p>As an emergency physician working on the frontlines, I have seen firsthand that &#8220;no bed syndrome&#8221; is not a shortage problem — it is a coordination problem. It is a flow problem. It is a systems problem.</p>



<p>And systems problems require modern, proactive, system wide solutions.</p>



<p>Ghana now has a clear opportunity to redesign emergency care through practical, affordable, and globally aligned approaches.</p>



<p>The Real Issue: A System Under Strain, not a Lack of Beds or Mattresses.</p>



<p>The public often imagines &#8220;no bed syndrome&#8221; as a physical shortage of beds. The root causes are structural:</p>



<p>There are;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>No unified emergency triage system</li>



<li>No real-time visibility of bed availability</li>



<li>Slow internal patient flow</li>



<li>Weak ambulance-hospital coordination</li>



<li>Lack of accountability for emergency refusals</li>
</ul>



<p>These gaps create delays, diversions, and preventable deaths — even when beds exist. Ending this crisis requires a modern emergency care ecosystem, not just more infrastructure.</p>



<p>A Modern, Proactive Framework for Ending &#8220;No Bed Syndrome&#8221;</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>National Emergency Triage &amp; Stabilisation Standards</li>
</ol>



<p>Every emergency patient that reports to a medical facility in Ghana must be:</p>



<p>-I- Assessed immediately, -I- Stabilised, and</p>



<p>-I- Coordinated for transfer if needed, following established national referral pathways. This will replace the outdated practice of refusing patients at the gate.</p>



<p>A unified triage system, adapted from global best practices, ensures that the sickest patients receive urgent care without delay.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Real-Time Bed Visibility Across Hospitals</li>
</ul>



<p>A modern health system cannot operate on guesswork. Accra&#8217;s major hospitals should be digitally interconnected, allowing ambulance teams to know — in real time — where capacity exists.</p>



<p>Ghana needs a simple, scalable bed-visibility system that works in both digital and low-resource settings.</p>



<p>This includes:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Structured manual reporting for facilities with limited connectivity</li>



<li>A digital dashboard for larger hospitals</li>



<li>Integration with ambulance dispatch</li>
</ul>



<p>This single reform eliminates unnecessary diversions and saves lives.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Faster Internal Patient Flow</li>
</ul>



<p>Beds are often unavailable at the entry points of major hospitals because patients stay longer than necessary due to slow processes.</p>



<p>Modern flow reforms include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Dedicated Bed Managers</li>



<li>Early discharge planning</li>



<li>Short-stay/observation units</li>



<li>Daily &#8220;flow huddles&#8221; between ED and wards</li>
</ul>



<p>These measures free up beds faster and reduce emergency department congestion.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Strong Ambulance-Hospital Coordination</li>
</ul>



<p>Ambulances must not roam from hospital to hospital. A modern system requires:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Pre-arrival communication</li>



<li>Acceptance-before-arrival rules</li>



<li>Routing guided by real-time bed visibility</li>
</ul>



<p>This protects patients from dangerous delays and ensures ambulances deliver patients to the right facility the first time.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Data, Monitoring &amp; Accountability</li>
</ul>



<p>For the first time, &#8220;no bed&#8221; refusals must become a reportable event. Hospitals should track:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Emergency refusals</li>



<li>ED boarding time</li>



<li>Bed occupancy</li>



<li>Deaths in transit</li>



<li>Ambulance diversions</li>
</ul>



<p>Weekly dashboards and monthly reviews create transparency and drive improvement.</p>



<p>A Smarter, Scalable, Ghana-Ready Solution This modern approach is:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Low-cost</li>



<li>Scalable across all regions</li>



<li>Compatible with both digital and low-resource facilities</li>



<li>Aligned with global emergency care standards</li>
</ul>



<p>It does not require massive new buildings. It requires coordination, visibility, and system design, including continuous monitoring and evaluation.</p>



<p>A New Era for Emergency Care in Ghana</p>



<p>If fully implemented nationwide, our country could see:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A dramatic reduction in emergency refusals</li>



<li>Faster treatment for critically ill patients</li>



<li>Improved ambulance efficiency</li>



<li>Better use of existing hospital capacity</li>



<li>Fewer preventable deaths</li>
</ul>



<p>Ending &#8220;no bed syndrome&#8221; is not only possible — it is achievable now, with the right systems in place.</p>



<p>Is Ghana ready for a modern emergency care system? Ghana must decide — now — whether we will continue to accept preventable deaths as routine, or whether we will build an emergency care system worthy of the people it serves.</p>



<p>Thank you. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minority Caucus has criticised what it describes as inconsistencies and policy symbolism within the Mahama administration’s flagship programmes, including the 24-hour economy initiative.</p>



<p>The Caucus argued that while legislation has been introduced, implementation structures remain unclear and incomplete.</p>



<p>According to the statement signed by Frank Annoh-Dompreh, the 24-hour economy “has departed totally from its original vision”. It added: “What has been delivered is not a functional 24-hour economic system, but the creation of an authority without the operational architecture required for shift systems, labour frameworks, industrial coordination, production systems, and delivery mechanisms.”</p>



<p>The Minority also raised concerns about employment data being communicated by government officials.</p>



<p>It pointed to what it described as contradictions between claims of 300,000 jobs and assertions of one million jobs created.</p>



<p>“A government that cannot agree with itself on employment data cannot credibly manage national employment policy,” the statement said, adding that headlines were being prioritised over verified facts.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Caucus argued that flagship initiatives such as the National Apprenticeship Programme and the National Coding Programme were being celebrated at the level of announcements and launches, without sufficient evidence of measurable outcomes.</p>



<p>“Public policy must be measured by impact, not publicity,” the Minority stressed.</p>



<p>The statement concluded that reform without implementation design amounts to “policy symbolism”, warning that legislative announcements without structural backing risk eroding public trust in governance and national transformation efforts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that President Donald Trump violated federal law when he unilaterally <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-11-05-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imposed sweeping tariffs across the globe</a>, a striking loss for the White House on an issue that has been central to the president’s foreign policy and economic agenda.</p>



<p>The decision is arguably the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/economy/scotus-trump-tariffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most important loss the second Trump</a> administration has sustained at the conservative Supreme Court, which last year repeatedly sided with the president in a series of emergency rulings on immigration, the firing of the leaders of independent agencies and deep cuts to government spending.</p>



<p>Chief Justice John Roberts <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-1287_4gcj.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote the majority opinion</a> and the court agreed 6-3 that the tariffs exceeded the law.</p>



<p>“The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope,” Roberts wrote for the court. </p>



<p>“In light of the breadth, history, and constitutional context of that asserted authority, he must identify clear congressional authorization to exercise it.”</p>



<p>The emergency authority Trump attempted to rely on, the court said, “falls short.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Symphonic Music has announced the release of&nbsp;<em>King of Kings</em>, a symphonic gospel EP now available on all major digital platforms.</p>

The throne is exalted. The sound is unveiled.”</p>



<p>The EP features an array of vocal talents, including Charnte Eseyin, Noble G, Manuel Bless, Grace Charles, Joy Somie, Samuel Hutcherson, Rush The High Priest, L.C. Rudolph and Dave da Musicbox.</p>



<p>The collaborative nature of the project is reflected in songs such as the title track&nbsp;<em>King of Kings</em>, which features Charnte Eseyin and Rush The High Priest, and&nbsp;<em>Adonai</em>, featuring Manuel Bless.</p>



<p>A production team led the recording and arrangement process. The team includes Vocal Director Nayaw, Assistant Production Lead and Bassist Prince Sennah, Band Director and Drummer Emmanuel Bludo Jr., Pianists B Sharp and J. Morris, Synthesist Isaac Obiri Siaw, Guitarist Emmanuel Tetteh, Timpani and Stems by Emmanuel Donkoh, and Project Manager Gideon Donkoh.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President John Dramani Mahama has stressed that building a strong steel industry is key to Ghana’s infrastructure ambitions and regional economic leadership. </p>



<p>Speaking at the B5 Plus Ltd steel manufacturing plant commissioning on the value chain of local manufacturing, Mahama said, “We are exporting finished and semi-finished products, not raw scrap.”</p>



<p>He highlighted the government’s Big Push infrastructure programme, which he says is driving investments across multiple sectors. </p>



<p>“Government is investing heavily in roads and highways, railway modernization, bridges and interchanges, energy transmission lines, affordable housing, and industrial parks,” Mahama said.</p>



<p>President Mahama emphasised the critical role of steel in national and continental development. </p>



<p>&#8220;All these I have mentioned require iron and steel,” he noted, adding that “Africa has projected to require over 100 billion annually in infrastructure development,” with West Africa alone facing significant infrastructure deficits.</p>



<p>He argued that a robust domestic steel sector could serve both national and regional needs. “If Ghana develops a strong steel base, we will not only build our own roads and bridges, we will also supply steel to the whole sub-region,” he said.</p>



<p>He described the link between infrastructure and industrial strategy: “This is how infrastructure becomes industrial strategy.”</p>



<p>On energy-intensive industries, he added, “The 24-hour economy program is particularly relevant to energy-intensive industries such as steel manufacturing.” </p>



<p>President Mahama also highlighted his role in strengthening industrial policy, noting, “I had the honor and privilege yesterday to sign the 24-hour Authority bill into law.”</p>



<p>He made it clear that investments in local steel production are central to Ghana’s vision of industrial growth, job creation, and regional leadership in infrastructure supply.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>US President Donald Trump says he will direct US agencies, including the defence department, to &#8220;begin the process of identifying and releasing&#8221; government files on aliens and extraterrestrial life.</p>



<p>Trump made the declaration in a post on Truth Social, after he accused Barack Obama earlier in the day of revealing classified information when the former president said &#8220;aliens are real&#8221; on a podcast last week.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not supposed to be doing that,&#8221; Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding: &#8220;He made a big mistake.&#8221;</p>



<p>Asked if he also thinks aliens are real, Trump answered: &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re real or not.&#8221;</p>



<p>Former US President Obama told podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen that he thinks aliens are real in an interview released last Saturday.</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re real, but I haven&#8217;t seen them, and they&#8217;re not being kept in Area 51,&#8221; Obama said.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no underground facility unless there&#8217;s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.&#8221;</p>



<p>After the comment made headlines, Obama sought to clarify he thinks it is statistically likely life exists beyond Earth, given the vastness of the universe.</p>



<p>In a follow-up post on Instagram, Obama, who served as US president between 2009-17, clarified: &#8220;I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!&#8221;</p>



<p>Obama&#8217;s initial comments were made during a quickfire &#8220;lightning&#8221; round of questions on the podcast.</p>



<p>There was no indication that Obama relied on classified information when he gave the interview. The BBC has contacted Obama for comment. The Democrat and Trump, a Republican, are longstanding mutual political antagonists.</p>



<p>For his part, Trump said on Thursday on Air Force One that while a lot of people believe in the existence of aliens, he never talks about it, and &#8220;doesn&#8217;t have an opinion on it&#8221;.</p>



<p>Then a few hours later, he posted on Truth Social that &#8220;based on the tremendous interest shown&#8221; he will seek the release of files &#8220;related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs), and any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters&#8221;.</p>



<p>The US has seen renewed public interest in UFOs and extraterrestrial life in recent years, sparked in 2017 by reports about a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42379749" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secret Pentagon programme</a> to probe testimony from pilots and other US military members who had reported seeing strange objects in the sky.</p>



<p>In 2022, Congress held <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-61474201" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first hearings on UFOs in 50 years</a> and the Pentagon promised more transparency on the matter &#8211; setting up a dedicated office to collect reports of all military UFO encounters.</p>



<p>The following year, a US House of Representatives <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66320498" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panel</a> on the topic produced no major bombshells nor confirmation of alien life. In a 2024 report, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-68515515" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagon said there was &#8220;no evidence&#8221;</a> that the US government had encountered alien life, and that most UFO sightings were just ordinary objects.</p>

<p>Traffic on the Apam Junction–Winneba stretch of the highway has been temporarily halted following an accident involving a fuel tanker at Ekumfi Essarkyir Junction in the Central Region.</p>



<p>The tanker reportedly lost control and overturned, blocking a section of the road.</p>



<p>Personnel from the Apam Fire Station indicated that part of the fuel cargo spilled onto the highway, raising fears of a possible explosion.</p>



<p>Adom News’ Kofi Adjei, who visited the scene, reported that as a precautionary measure, officers from the Ghana National Fire Service and the Police have cordoned off the area and suspended vehicular movement.</p>



<p>Emergency response teams are currently working to transfer the remaining fuel into another tanker to minimise the risk.</p>



<p>Authorities have urged motorists to use alternative routes while efforts continue to clear the scene and restore normal traffic flow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President of the Ghana Union of Traders’ Associations (GUTA), Clement Boateng, has welcomed the signing into law of the 24-Hour Economy bill, describing it as a major boost for the private sector and the wider business community.</p>



<p>Speaking on <strong>Joy News Today</strong> on Friday, February 20, Mr Boateng said the legislation fulfills a key campaign pledge by the National Democratic Congress (NDC) government and signals a new phase in the country’s economic transformation drive.</p>



<p>“I think that we are all aware that this is a major flagship programme announced by the NDC government in their manifesto, and so when they assumed power, everybody was expecting that a major policy of this nature would be implemented as soon as possible,” he stated.</p>



<p>Mr Boateng noted, however, that the policy required careful preparation before it could be rolled out.</p>



<p>“But we should also not forget that for a policy of this nature, there is a lot of work that needs to be done; we have to talk about it, even the framework aspect of it, and then the legal implications,” he said.</p>



<p>According to him, the government took time to address the structural and legal considerations necessary for the smooth implementation of the initiative.</p>



<p>“I think they were doing all these things, and by God’s grace, they have finished, and then the president has also assented to it, so it has paved a way for its implementation,” he added.</p>



<p>Mr Boateng described the President’s assent to the bill as a positive development for businesses across the country.</p>



<p>“I think it’s good news for the private sector as well as the business community in general,” he said.</p>



<p>He expressed optimism that the policy would drive industrialisation and help reposition the economy for sustained growth.</p>



<p>“We think by paving a way for its implementation, it is then going to push the economic transformation and the industrialisation that we all desire as a country,” he noted.</p>



<p>The GUTA president further argued that the introduction of a multi-shift system under the 24-Hour Economy framework would generate sustainable employment opportunities.</p>



<p>“It will also create sustainable employment by introducing the multi-shift system, which is the three-shift system that we all aspire to achieve. It will also enhance productivity and promote economic growth,” he explained.</p>



<p>Mr Boateng added that increased industrial activity would ultimately boost government revenue through job creation and taxation.</p>



<p>“And then when we are able to set up factories as a way of industrialisation it will also enable the government to get more revenue by way of the jobs that it will create and also let the government get its revenue by way of taxes,” he said.</p>



<p>He urged stakeholders, including businesses and policymakers, to support the successful implementation of the policy.</p>



<p>“I think by and large it is good news, and then we all have to help to make sure this 24-Hour Economy is achievable,” Mr Boateng said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Beyond housing supply and regulation, Ghana’s housing crisis is closely linked to the country’s weak transportation system.

This has created excessive pressure on the limited housing stock in urban centres, pushing rent prices to unsustainable levels.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana’s housing problem dates back to the period immediately after independence. The challenge can be traced to the era of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana’s first President, whose government initiated several public housing schemes. Some of these developments, particularly in Tema, are still in use today.</p>



<p>Similarly, during the regime of President I. K. Acheampong, the government introduced the Low-Cost Housing Scheme. These houses can be found across the country, especially in many district capitals, and were intended to make housing affordable for low- and middle-income earners. Despite these efforts, population growth, rapid urbanisation, and limited sustained public investment gradually widened the housing deficit.</p>



<p>In recent times, the housing gap has become so large that government alone can no longer address it. This reality has led to increased private sector participation in the real estate and housing market. To protect tenants, government introduced rent control measures to regulate rent levels and landlord practices, but enforcement has largely been ineffective.</p>



<p>More recently, government introduced a Rent Assistance Programme, under which, through public–private partnerships, loans are provided to citizens to enable them pay rent advances. This intervention was necessitated by the widespread demand by landlords for up to two years’ rent in advance. While the programme has recorded an impressive loan recovery rate of about 99 percent, the number of beneficiaries remains far below the actual demand.</p>



<p><strong>Transportation as a Structural Cause of the Housing Crisis</strong></p>



<p>Beyond housing supply and regulation, Ghana’s housing crisis is closely linked to the country’s weak transportation system. Poor and inefficient transport forces many workers to live close to their workplaces, especially in Accra and other major cities. This has created excessive pressure on the limited housing stock in urban centres, pushing rent prices to unsustainable levels.</p>



<p>To address this structural challenge, government should consider developing a high-speed or bullet train system connecting Accra to the various regional capitals. Such a system would enable workers to live in more affordable locations while commuting efficiently to their places of work. For example, a worker could choose to live in Aflao and still commute daily to ministries and offices in Accra within a reasonable time.</p>



<p>The introduction of a bullet train system would significantly reduce pressure on housing in Accra and other major cities, help stabilise rent prices, and promote balanced regional development.</p>



<p><strong>Funding the Bullet Train Project</strong></p>



<p>The bullet train project can be funded with strong citizen participation, provided government first builds public trust through transparency and accountability. Government must engage the public on how the funds will be administered, establish a dedicated account for the project, and publish annual reports detailing inflows, expenditures, and balances.</p>



<p>The fund must be strictly ring-fenced for the bullet train project. Under no circumstance should the funds be diverted to finance the national budget or any unrelated government activity. Legal safeguards must be put in place to ensure this protection.</p>



<p>A dedicated levy of GH₵1.00 on petroleum products can be introduced to raise sustainable revenue for the project. Given nationwide fuel consumption levels, this levy could generate significant and predictable funds over time.</p>



<p>In addition, the fund can be securitised to raise upfront capital, allowing construction to begin while repayments are made gradually from the dedicated revenue stream.</p>



<p><strong>Administration and Legal Regime</strong></p>



<p>The bullet train system should not be managed directly by government. Instead, it should be operated under a robust Public–Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement. Ghana’s experience with state-managed transport systems such as Metro Mass Transit and Ayalolo buses demonstrates how political interference, abuse of office, and weak governance structures can undermine public investments. These failures must not be repeated. Under this arrangement, management and operations should be insulated from political control, with clear performance benchmarks and accountability mechanisms.</p>



<p>Government’s role should be limited to regulation, oversight, and enforcement of contractual obligations.</p>



<p>The operation and financing of the bullet train must be backed by a dedicated law that prevents abuse, diversion, or amendment of the fund for any other purpose. The only permissible amendment to the law should be the abolition of the petroleum levy once all expenses related to the train have been fully settled. There should be no “emergency” provisions that allow for the use of the funds under any circumstances.</p>



<p>Strong internal control systems must be established, including independent audits, parliamentary oversight, and public disclosure requirements, to prevent misappropriation and misuse of funds.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>Ghana’s housing crisis cannot be solved through housing policies alone. It requires integrated planning that links housing, transportation, financing, and governance. A transparently funded, legally protected, and professionally managed bullet train system could transform commuting patterns, ease housing pressure in major cities, and drive long-term national development. The success of such a project will depend not only on infrastructure, but on discipline, accountability, and political restraint.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC), Simon Madjie, has urged investors to take advantage of emerging opportunities within Ghana’s coconut value chain to drive industrial growth, export diversification and environmental sustainability.</p>



<p>He made the call in Accra at the Ghana Tree Crops Investment Summit and Exhibition organised by the Tree Crops Development Authority (TCDA).</p>



<p>The summit, held under the theme “Sustainable Growth through Tree Crop Investment: Resetting and Rebuilding Ghana’s Green Economy,” brought together policymakers, development partners, private sector actors and investors to explore strategies for expanding Ghana’s tree crops industry.</p>



<p>Mr Madjie described coconut as one of the most commercially viable yet underdeveloped crops in Ghana’s agricultural portfolio.</p>



<p>He noted that Ghana is Africa’s leading coconut producer and ranks 13th globally, with annual production exceeding 500,000 metric tonnes, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).</p>



<p>Despite this, he said domestic supply remained insufficient to meet the combined needs of local consumption, industrial processing and export markets.</p>



<p>Citing 2026 data from the International Trade Centre (ITC), Mr Madjie stated that Ghana had an estimated export potential of US$23 million in desiccated coconut, with approximately US$19 million yet to be realised.</p>



<p>He stressed that the coconut value chain offers investment prospects across plantation development, structured outgrower schemes, aggregation, storage, processing and advanced manufacturing.</p>



<p>“The majority of value in the global coconut industry is captured after the farm gate. That is where Ghana is positioning investors to operate,” Mr Madjie said.</p>



<p>He encouraged both domestic and foreign investors to partner with Ghana to build a globally competitive coconut industry that delivers strong commercial returns and employment opportunities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University, Professor Williams Peprah, has expressed worry about the heavy politicisation of the cocoa farming industry.</p>



<p>According to him, the politicisation has made it difficult to see the actual benefit of the industry from policy propositions and implementations.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News in relation to the difficulties facing the cocoa industry, the US-based Finance Professor said commodity prices are very sensitive, thus the government should be mindful of the policy prescription to avoid losing gains.</p>



<p>He proposed the establishment of a Commodity Stabilisation Fund to address funding challenges anytime the industry is facing liquidity issues.</p>



<p>“The world market price, especially commodities like cocoa is highly price sensitive, so whatever decision one will take will always have to remember that the price can go up or down based on the product and market fluctuation. It has already been projected that supply (cocoa beans) was increasing on the market. We should have anticipated that the price would come down”.</p>



<p>“Just after Covid-19, we realise that cocoa price was going up because there was shortage. And if I was part of the team then, I will have strategise that the price will come down and whatever price we are giving to the cocoa farmers we will have factored in another strategy to probably to establish what I may term as a Commodity Stabilization Fund for all the commodities we have &#8211; gold, oil, cocoa – and put a certain percentage in that fund, so that any time there are price fluctuations that fund will be used to support the farmers””, he explained.</p>



<p>He urged policymakers to craft an enhanced strategy to address the numerous challenges in the cocoa industry.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At a press briefing organised held in Accra, Managing Director, Seidu Yonye emphasised that because Ghana’s cocoa purchasing system is "liquidity-intensive and time-sensitive," any delays in funding creates a vacuum.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Amidst concerns of delayed payments, Produce Buying Company (PBC), has appealed to COCOBOD to fast-track payment processes and resolve ‘systematic issues’ that have long plagued the industry.</p>



<p>The appeal comes at a time where concerns have been raised about COCBOD’s ability to ensure timely monetary settlements, coupled with reforms to ensure the restructuring of PBC’s operations, to regain its position as the largest cocoa procurement company in the sector.</p>



<p>At a press briefing organised held in Accra, Managing Director, Seidu Yonye emphasised that because Ghana’s cocoa purchasing system is &#8220;liquidity-intensive and time-sensitive,&#8221; any delays in funding creates a vacuum.</p>



<p>The management of PBC noted that the goal of this appeal is to &#8220;resolve the systematic issues of delayed payments to reduce the incentive for arbitrage and smuggling&#8221;.</p>



<p>To restore financial sanity, PBC is not just asking for speed; they also revealed the establishment of accountable payment systems to aide smooth disbursements.</p>

<p>&#8220;Transparent payment system accessible to COCOBOD and Banks. This architecture will allow stakeholders to track fund drawdowns and utilisation, cocoa deliveries and entitlements as well as real-time arrears.</p>



<p>According to the MD, this &#8220;receivables-based structure will allow banks to finance cocoa purchasing and monitor the supply chain with far greater confidence&#8221;.</p>



<p>Beyond the balance sheets, the MD’s statement focused heavily on farmer security. By streamlining payments, PBC aims to eliminate non-functional buyers who often exploit liquidity gaps to shortchange farmers.</p>
