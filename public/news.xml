										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Vice President Professor Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang on Thursday urged women not to allow themselves to be intimidated or belittled because of their gender.</p>



<p>She made the call at the First Annual National Forum on Women in Government and Media, held at the Banquet Hall of the Presidency in Accra, on the theme: “Leadership, Visibility, Public Trust”.</p>



<p>The high‑level forum brought together distinguished women leaders, policymakers and media professionals to foster strategic collaboration, enhance representation and strengthen public confidence in leadership and governance.</p>



<p>It reflected a strong national commitment to inclusive leadership, institutional credibility and the advancement of women in public service and the media.</p>



<p>“We must refuse to be belittled. We must refuse to be intimidated. We must refuse to be shaped in other people’s images,” the Vice President said.</p>



<p>“We must have faith in ourselves. We must refuse for anyone to talk us down simply because we are women. We are proud of being women.”</p>



<p>Prof Opoku-Agyemang noted that women in leadership often work under heightened pressure and scrutiny. Yet, she said, national development required women to help shape Ghana’s direction—whether in Cabinet, Parliament, boardrooms, newsrooms, production studios or communities across the country.</p>



<p>She observed that visibility helps expand opportunities and normalize women’s authority, but said this must be supported by credibility, which is sustained by public trust.</p>



<p>According to her, trust was strengthened through accountability, clear communication and competence.</p>



<p>The Vice President noted that when media reporting was contextual rather than sensational, public trust is reinforced.</p>



<p>Therefore, the relationship between women in government and women in the media “must not be accidental; it must be strategic,” she stressed, because media shapes perception and perception influences confidence.</p>



<p>She cautioned that when gender issues are reduced to clickbait or when stories about women focus on superficial matters such as appearance rather than intellect, competence and outcomes, the space for women in public life becomes limited or insignificant.</p>



<p>Prof Opoku-Agyemang said women journalists and editors carry particular responsibility—not because women were morally superior, but because their presence brings perspective.</p>



<p>Women in editorial spaces, she said, are able to question framing, challenge assumptions and insist on depth.</p>



<p>“For many, the media is a classroom for governance, economics, health, public policy and more,” she added.</p>



<p>Women in media leadership, she said, help clarify complex issues, elevate credible expertise and expose harmful practices, thereby contributing to national development.</p>



<p>She also acknowledged the challenges of the digital age, where speed and controversy tend to be rewarded more than nuance, but insisted that standards must guide editorial decisions.</p>



<p>Emphasising that inclusive leadership was a developmental imperative, the Vice President said nations that integrate women meaningfully into decision‑making build stronger institutions, foster more civil governance and promote inclusive growth. “Women are not only beneficiaries of development; we are among its drivers,” she said.</p>



<p>Prof Opoku-Agyemang stressed that expanding representation does not equate to lowering standards.</p>



<p>She encouraged women in government and public institutions to lead with integrity, communicate transparently and mentor younger women.</p>



<p>“Let’s guide them. Let’s restore trust and let them know that we have their back,” she said.</p>



<p>She added that visibility should go beyond self‑promotion to include clear explanations of one’s work, enabling citizens to judge performance on substance rather than speculation.</p>



<p>To young women entering public life and journalism, she said their work would shape public understanding of power and potential.</p>



<p>She urged them to interrogate every story and decision with clarity and open‑mindedness.</p>



<p>“Ask yourself: Whatever I’m reporting, does it clarify? Does it provoke? Does it inform? Does it inflame? And to what end?”</p>



<p>The Vice President emphasized that democratic governance depended on informed citizens, and informed citizens depended on credible journalism and credible leadership.</p>



<p>She therefore called for a deliberate relationship between women in governance and women in media to strengthen democratic accountability.</p>



<p>“Let us commit to leadership that is visible, credible and compassionate. Let us build institutions that earn trust through words and actions. Let us shape national narratives responsibly and ensure that the story of Ghana’s development is told accurately, fairly and with confidence in Ghana’s women,” she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) is set to implement the Physical and Electronic Devices Act this year, Mr Anthony Kwasi Sarpong, Commissioner-General of the GRA, has announced.</p>



<p>He explained that enforcement of the Act would facilitate the deployment of physical monitoring devices at retail outlets nationwide, as part of reforms being undertaken by the Authority to automate the Value Added Tax (VAT) system.</p>



<p>The automation process began in 2025 with the passage of a new VAT law, he said at the closing session of a three-day management retreat of the Domestic Tax Revenue Division (DTRD) of the GRA in Sunyani.</p>



<p>The retreat was held on the theme: “Transforming for impact and growth: Focusing on VAT performance and compliance.”</p>



<p>Mr Sarpong noted that the legal reforms were expected to support the automation of VAT collection and enhance compliance. He added that enforcement of the Act would empower the GRA to monitor transactions nationwide and significantly improve VAT performance.</p>



<p>He disclosed that current VAT performance stood at about 40 per cent, leaving a gap of approximately 60 per cent. This means that out of every 100 potential VAT opportunities, only about 40 per cent were being captured, a situation he described as unsatisfactory.</p>



<p>“We are determined to change that so that VAT becomes a key anchor in our national revenue mobilisation,” he stated, stressing that businesses remained critical partners in the tax system.</p>



<p>Mr Sarpong urged taxpayers to cooperate with the GRA and honour their VAT obligations to enable the nation to generate the revenue required for progressive and sustainable development.</p>



<p>He expressed optimism that with a strong sense of responsibility, commitment, motivation and zeal, the Authority would achieve its tax targets.</p>



<p>Mr Sarpong added that the nation had provided the necessary opportunities and resources for GRA personnel and encouraged them to work diligently.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>First Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Benard Ahiafor, has urged Members of Parliament (MPs) to exercise restraint and diplomacy in their remarks following the killing of eight Ghanaian tomato traders by suspected jihadists in Burkina Faso, cautioning against partisan commentary on the tragic incident.</p>



<p>Mr Ahiafor, who is also the MP for Akatsi South, gave the advice in Parliament on Thursday while presiding over proceedings during discussions on a statement regarding the deaths of the traders.</p>



<p>He stressed that the matter should be handled with sensitivity and unity rather than political point‑scoring.</p>



<p>Earlier, Reverend John Ntim Fordjour, New Patriotic Party (NPP) MP for Assin South, criticised government for failing to issue a travel advisory to Ghanaians on the security situation in Burkina Faso before the attack, noting that the advisory was issued only after the incident.</p>



<p>In a reaction, Mr Samuel Atta Mills, National Democratic Congress (NDC) MP for Edina Eguafo Abrem, argued that the previous NPP administration had failed to utilise $12 million allocated for the construction of the Pwalugu Dam.</p>



<p>He said the dam was intended to support irrigation for tomato cultivation and would have reduced Ghanaian traders’ reliance on tomatoes from Burkina Faso.</p>



<p>Mr Atta Mills maintained that completion of the dam would have provided local traders with sufficient and quality tomatoes, thereby avoiding the risks associated with cross‑border trade.</p>



<p>Reiterating his call, Mr Ahiafor said while holding government accountable was important, partisan attacks during a national tragedy undermined collective efforts to protect citizens.</p>



<p>He urged MPs to adopt a united front in addressing security challenges and safeguarding the lives of Ghanaian traders.</p>



<p>The House expressed condolences to the bereaved families and called for enhanced collaboration to address cross‑border security concerns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The government is set to reform the country’s cocoa sector with measures to promote domestic processing, improve financial sustainability, and strengthen governance.</p>



<p>Isaac Adongo, Chairman of Parliament’s Finance Committee, announced this at a press conference dubbed “Cocoa Sector Reforms and Matters Arising,” organised by the National Democratic Congress (NDC) Majority Caucus at Parliament House on Thursday.</p>



<p>He stressed the need to promote higher levels of domestic cocoa processing to create jobs, grow Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and make cocoa a strong pillar of Ghana’s economy.</p>



<p>“We want to ensure that cocoa remains a viable and robust pillar in Ghana’s economy.</p>



<p>“Our interventions are guided by the conviction that a financially resilient and well-governed cocoa sector is essential for the prosperity of millions of Ghanaians who depend directly and indirectly on cocoa, especially farmers in rural communities,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Adongo outlined proposed legislative reforms, including a new bill to be introduced in Parliament to restrict the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) from engaging in non-core activities, improve governance, restore financial sustainability and positive equity, and strengthen investor confidence.</p>



<p>He added that the government plans to convert GH¢5.8 billion in legacy debt to restore COCOBOD’s financial health and take over cocoa road construction to free up resources.</p>



<p>Mr Adongo, who is also the National Democratic Congress (NDC) Member of Parliament for Bolgatanga Central, reiterated the government’s commitment to supporting farmers and ensuring they receive good prices for their cocoa.</p>



<p>“We are certain that farmers are still better off under this administration than they were under the previous government,” he said.</p>



<p>According to the Majority in Parliament, the reforms are expected to contribute significantly to Ghana’s economic growth and prosperity.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as part of reforms in the cocoa industry, the government has reduced the farm gate price of cocoa from GH¢3,625 to GH¢2,587 per bag.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dr Samuel Kaba Akoriyea, the Director-General of the Ghana Health Service (GHS), has directed directors at the headquarters, regional and district levels, and all departmental heads, to enforce the wearing of approved uniforms and visible name tags by health workers in public health facilities nationwide.</p>



<p>The directive, issued during a working visit to the Catholic Hospital at Battor, aims to strengthen professionalism, accountability, and patient safety across the health sector.</p>



<p>Dr Kaba was at the facility to assess operations at its Cervical Cancer Treatment and Training Centre.</p>



<p>He explained that the measure was necessary to prevent impersonation and safeguard both patients and health workers.</p>



<p>The move follows a recent incident at the Mambrobi Polyclinic in Accra, where a woman allegedly disguised herself as a nurse and stole a baby after pretending to administer medication.</p>



<p>Dr Kaba said proper identification would help avert such incidents and rebuild public trust in the health system.</p>



<p>He noted that visible name tags also improve service delivery, as patients could easily identify health professionals, promoting transparency and professional conduct.</p>



<p>“When patients know your name and you are aware that they know you, you are more likely to be professional in your service delivery,” he said.</p>



<p>“This is an international standard. In hospitals abroad, nurses and doctors are properly dressed with visible name tags, and those in specialised units wear scrubs with identification. We must adopt the same standards.”</p>



<p>He added that identification protects health workers by deterring impersonators and enhancing security within facilities.</p>



<p>He also encouraged staff to wear GHS-branded attire when travelling for official duties, saying proper identification commands respect and recognition.</p>



<p>“Our uniform identifies us, gives us privilege, and protects us. We must take pride in our profession and safeguard its integrity,” Dr Kaba stated.</p>



<p>Dr Atsu Dodor, Volta Regional Director of Health Services, welcomed the directive and pledged his support to ensure full compliance across all health facilities in the region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President of the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), Dr Kofi Nsiah-Poku, says the recent appreciation of the cedi is not enough to trigger immediate price reductions, as manufacturers are still recovering from heavy losses incurred during the period of a weak currency.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express Business Edition on Thursday, he explained that when the dollar surged, many manufacturers absorbed significant losses.</p>



<p>“At the time that the dollar was very high, I was making losses. Now that the dollar price is low, I have to recover the loss,” he said.</p>



<p>He stressed that the stronger cedi is only one factor in pricing decisions. “Some of the reasons why prices are not dropping as expected, even though the dollar has become very steep, is one of the reasons, but not the only reason,” he noted.</p>



<p>Dr Nsiah-Poku pointed to uncertainty about the durability of the cedi’s gains. According to him, industry players are not yet convinced that the economy is strong enough to sustain the currency’s current position.</p>



<p>“Industry still does not think that the economy is so robust,” he said.</p>



<p>He explained that Ghana operates largely as a credit economy, which complicates pricing decisions. Manufacturers often supply goods on credit and receive payment months later.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6OW8mOIRQKw?si=_kZLrZlnzDAbe08v" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“This is a credit economy. If I manufacture and give it to my customers on credit, and they pay me in two, three, or four months, and by that time, if the gain has reversed, what do I do?” he asked.</p>



<p>That risk, he said, makes manufacturers cautious about reducing prices too quickly.</p>



<p>“So we are very careful in trying to reduce the prices,” he added.</p>



<p>Beyond exchange rate movements, Dr Nsiah-Poku also raised concerns about high utility costs, which continue to weigh heavily on production.</p>



<p>“The cost of utilities is even high, even when the dollar is going down,” he said.</p>



<p>He argued that utility tariffs should reflect the stronger cedi, especially when costs are linked to foreign-exchange inputs.</p>



<p>“If the dollar is going down, we expect that utility cost should also be down, because we now have a higher cost, which is balancing the gain in the exchange rate,” he stated.</p>



<p>His comments highlight the delicate balance manufacturers face as they navigate currency volatility, credit risk, and rising operational costs.</p>



<p>While the cedi’s performance may signal macroeconomic improvement, Dr Nsiah-Poku’s assessment suggests that for industry, the recovery process is still underway.</p>



<p>For now, he insists, stability and sustainability matter more than short-term currency gains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The strengthening cedi alone cannot bring prices down, President of the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), Dr Kofi Nsiah-Poku, has said.</p>



<p>He insists that businesses are still grappling with past losses, high utility costs and fragile economic confidence.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express Business Edition on Thursday, Dr Nsiah-Poku explained that manufacturers who suffered when the dollar surged are now trying to stabilise their books.</p>



<p>“At the time that the dollar was very high, I was making losses. Now that the dollar price is low, I have to recover the loss,” he said.</p>



<p>He noted that many consumers expect immediate price reductions because the exchange rate has improved, but the reality for industry is more complex.</p>



<p>“Some of the reasons why prices are not dropping as expected, even though the dollar has become very steep, is one of the reasons, but not the only reason,” he stated.</p>



<p>Beyond exchange rate movements, he pointed to concerns about sustainability. According to him, industry players are not fully convinced that the current economic gains are durable.</p>



<p>“Industry still does not think that the economy is so robust. And this is a credit economy,” he said.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6OW8mOIRQKw?si=_kZLrZlnzDAbe08v" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>Dr Nsiah-Poku explained that manufacturers often supply goods on credit and may not receive payment for months. That delay creates uncertainty.</p>



<p>“If I manufacture and give it to my customers on credit, and they pay me in two, three months, four months, and by that time, if the gain has reversed, what do I do?” he asked.</p>



<p>That risk, he said, forces businesses to act cautiously when adjusting prices.</p>



<p>“So we are very careful in trying to reduce the prices,” he added.</p>



<p>He also highlighted utility costs as a major factor keeping prices elevated. According to him, the cost of power and other services remains high, offsetting the gains from a stronger cedi.</p>



<p>“And also the cost of utilities is even high, even when the dollar is going down,” he said.</p>



<p>Dr Nsiah-Poku argued that if the exchange rate improves, utility costs should reflect that shift.</p>



<p>“If the dollar is going down, we expect that utility cost should also be down, because we now have a higher cost, which is balancing the gain in the exchange rate,” he explained.</p>



<p>His comments come at a time when many consumers are demanding price relief following the recent appreciation of the cedi.</p>



<p>But for industry, the equation is not straightforward. Past exchange rate losses, uncertainty about the durability of economic gains, and persistently high utility bills are combining to slow the pace of price reductions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested at about 08:00 on Thursday, it had nothing to do with Virginia Giuffre, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse.</p>



<p>What led to him being arrested started with information that came out in the massive Epstein file release in January, around activities while he was a trade envoy for the British government. But it will not have stopped there.</p>



<p>It was emails in those files that seem to be between Andrew and the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that led to Thames Valley Police getting involved.</p>



<p>One email in particular stood out. In November 2010, after Andrew had returned from a UK government-funded trip to Asia, he was sent a series of country reports relating to his trip.</p>



<p>Within five minutes of receiving them<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c99j01p1yjro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;he seems to have forwarded them to Epstein</a>, who had by this point already been convicted and spent time in prison for sex offences.</p>



<p>There were further email revelations from the files.</p>



<p>A month later, on Christmas Eve, Andrew appeared to email Epstein a confidential briefing on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand Province, Afghanistan, which was overseen at the time by British armed forces and funded by UK government money.</p>



<p>In a further email dated 9 February 2011, Andrew seems to suggest Epstein invest in a private equity firm he had visited a week before.</p>



<p>These will have formed the beginning of what today turned into a full investigation by Thames Valley Police. But detectives will have not relied only on the emails that we have seen.</p>



<p>In order to build a case they will have gone to the government and to the palace asking for emails that might explain what was going on. The palace said last Monday that it would &#8220;support&#8221; Thames Valley Police.</p>



<p>Detectives will also have done their own trawl of the three million documents in the Epstein files, and they will have asked for unredacted copies from the FBI or the US Department of Justice. The National Crime Agency is helping UK police forces with those requests.</p>



<p>So far we have seen only the tip of the iceberg, but detectives may have seen more of what lies under the surface</p>



<p>It is highly unlikely that the police arrested Andrew on Thursday on the basis of just a couple of emails people have seen within the Epstein files.</p>



<p>At this stage, Andrew has only been arrested. He has not been charged. He has always denied any wrongdoing arising from his relationship with Epstein and has not responded to specific BBC questions about the files released in January.</p>



<p>And a reminder, this arrest has nothing to do with allegations Andrew has previously faced from Giuffre, who said she was made to have sex with Andrew on a number of occasions in the early 2000s. An out-of-court financial settlement was reached between Andrew and Giuffre in 2022, which made no admission of wrongdoing on Andrew&#8217;s part.</p>



<p>The police released Andrew under investigation on Thursday evening. Typically with arrests relating to white collar crime, people are held for a few hours to allow for searches and initial questioning. Being released under investigation does not rule out further questioning at a later date.</p>



<p>Nowdetectives will have a big decision to make. This could take weeks.</p>



<p>Police officers with a crown on their cap badges will sit down with lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service and decide if there is sufficient evidence to charge the King&#8217;s brother.</p>



<p>If they decide to take the case to court, it will be called R v Mountbatten-Windsor, or in layman&#8217;s terms, the King against the King&#8217;s brother.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nollywood actress, Rosy Meurer, has reacted to backlash over her inconsistent claims about Tonto Dikeh’s failed marriage to Olakunle Churchill.</p>



<p>This comes a few hours after she denied ever knowing, meeting, or having any personal relationship with Tonto Dikeh when she was still married to Churchill.</p>



<p>The ex-couple divorced in 2017 over Churchill’s alleged extramarital affair with Meurer, who was alleged to be Tonto’s best friend.</p>



<p>Denying the allegation, Meurer, in a video, said she was the couple’s family friend.</p>



<p>‘”He (Churchill) and his wife remain family to me. We once hang out together before,” Meurer said at the time.</p>



<p>Four years after the couple’s divorce, Meurer got married to Churchill.</p>



<p>The news of their marriage generated controversy with people on social media accusing her of snatching her best friend’s husband.</p>



<p>Finally addressing the five-year controversy about her marriage on Wednesday, Meurer, in a new video on Instagram, <a href="https://dailypost.ng/2026/02/18/i-never-met-her-rosy-meurer-denies-knowing-tonto-dikeh-in-new-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denied ever having any relationship with Tonto Dikeh</a> in the past.</p>



<p>Following her new claim, Meurer faced backlash for not being consistent.</p>



<p>Speaking amid the backlash, Meurer in a lengthy Instagram post, attributed the previous video, in which she described Churchill and Tonto as “family friends”, to pressure from her management.</p>



<p>While claiming that she was forced to lie, she said, “You want me to hang on to the nonsense old video I made in fear due to the fact that I was so young and innocent.</p>



<p>“I was dragged into violence by force. With all the pressure then, PR team will make you say many things even if you don’t feel it is right. Right now whatever I say is THE REAL TRUTH. I am now older and wiser. No PR team can force me to say what they believed is better than my truth. If you like, bring videos of 1000 years ago. It does not change my reality.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nollywood actress Rosy Meurer has publicly denied knowing Tonto Dikeh before she married Olakunle Churchill.</p>



<p>Rosy Meurer stated this while addressing the viral report that she was Tonto Dikeh’s best friend.</p>



<p>It was reported on social media that Rosy Meurer snatched Olakunle Churchill, from her best friend, Tonto Dikeh.</p>



<p>In 2017, Olakunle was accused of cheating on his then wife, Tonto with Meurer, who was allegedly a close friend to the family.</p>



<p>In response to the allegation, Meurer who denied having sexual relationships with Churchill, stated that the couple were like family to her.</p>



<p>In the old video, Meurer said “I remain under big church foundation and he (Olakunle) remains family to me. His wife (Tonto Dikeh) remains family to me. We’ve hung out together before and I don’t see a big deal there. People should stop saying things that they do not know.”</p>



<p>Three years after the couple divorced, Rosy Meurer got married to Olakunle Churchill in 2021. Their marriage sparked controversy with netizens digging up the old allegations.</p>



<p>However, contradicting herself in a new Instagram video on Wednesday, Meurer who has been keeping mum since she married Churchill, denied ever being friends with Tonto Dikeh, stating that she has never met her before.</p>



<p>“These bloggers feed off lies. I can’t really blame them, but I blame all these gullible followers who just choose to believe lies and everything they see online. But today, I just want to tell you guys one thing, just this one time, so it can be on record.</p>



<p>“I was never my husband’s ex’s friend, not to talk of best friend. I have never met her. I have never seen her; she doesn’t have my number, I don’t have her number, and she’s like 8 to 9, 10 years older than I am. And I have read comments that I was her best friend or that she introduced me to her husband, and I snatched him, but it’s not true. If anyone has the proof otherwise, I dare you to bring it out.</p>



<p>“I was never friends with anyone. I don’t even know her. I met my husband separately from that other life that he has”, she said</p>



<p>Tonto tied the knot with Churchill in August 2015 and gave birth to their son, King Andre, in February 2016 before their messy divorce in July 2017 over alleged domestic violence and infidelity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Fresh controversy has emerged in the ongoing custody dispute involving Afrobeats star, Davido and his daughter, Imade, following the singer’s decision to withdraw from the case and subsequent public reactions that drew a formal response from the law firm representing the child’s mother.</p>



<p>Davido, whose real name is David Adeleke, announced late Friday that he had opted to discontinue the custody proceedings, insisting that he never sought sole custody of his daughter but only requested joint custody.</p>



<p>He maintained that no party emerged victorious from the case, describing the situation as a loss for the child involved.</p>



<p>“I never asked for full custody … I asked for joint custody. Nobody won, nobody lost but Imade … so I don’t know why some pple r celebrating. There’s nothing to celebrate,” the singer wrote on X.</p>



<p>Explaining his decision to withdraw, Davido alleged that events during court proceedings took an unacceptable turn, claiming that references were made to his late son, an experience he described as deeply distressing.</p>



<p>“I’ve decided to drop the case because … until she brought out her last card! MY DECEASED SON! THAT’S A NO NO! Lowest blow!” He stated.</p>



<p>The artiste added that his actions were driven by love and responsibility toward his daughter, expressing confidence that his efforts would be understood in the future.</p>



<p>“My daughter will grow up knowing I fought for her … let’s move on. One love!” he wrote.</p>



<p>Davido also took to his Instagram story to criticise the opposing legal team, alleging unprofessional conduct during the proceedings.</p>



<p>“I disgraced you in the courtroom … I was teaching you your work … and then went on to mention my son. Like I said in the courtroom, I pray you never go through what me and my wife have gone through ever,” he posted.</p>



<p>The online outburst followed earlier social media commentary by a Lagos-based legal practitioner, Maruf Muhammed, who had drawn public attention to tense moments during proceedings at the Lagos State High Court, Yaba.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="720" height="900" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937.png" alt="Lawyer fires back at Davido over social media harassment after custody case" class="wp-image-10032982645" title="Lawyer fires back at Davido over social media harassment after custody case" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937.png 720w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937-240x300.png 240w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937-112x140.png 112w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937-100x125.png 100w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937-200x250.png 200w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937-120x150.png 120w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937-339x424.png 339w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1937-40x50.png 40w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></figure>



<p>“Davido in High Court, Yaba now! Come and see drama in court. The lawyer made 001 lose his patience during cross-examination o! Be you never so high, the law is above you,” Muhammed wrote, later clarifying that the matter before the court related to the custody of Davido’s daughter, Imade.</p>



<p>In response to the public commentary and what it described as harassment directed at its partner, the law firm representing Imade’s mother, Sophia, issued a strongly worded statement defending its conduct and warning against intimidation of legal practitioners.</p>



<p>In the statement dated February 16, 2026, the firm said its attention had been drawn to inflammatory public statements, allegedly orchestrated by a Nigerian Afrobeats artiste on social media, concerning a custody matter currently before a court of competent jurisdiction in Lagos State.</p>



<p>“That matter is sub judice. It will be decided by the court alone, on evidence and law, and no amount of media commentary will sway that process or our approach to the case,” the firm stated.</p>



<p>It stressed that it would not comment on the substance of the case, citing adherence to the highest standards of professional conduct, but warned that threats, intimidation or harassment of counsel outside the courtroom pose a serious threat to the administration of justice.</p>



<p>“However, if legal practitioners are to be threatened, intimidated, or exposed to harassment outside the courtroom for asking questions, testing evidence, or discharging their professional duty to their clients, then the very foundation of justice is imperilled,” the statement said.</p>



<p>The firm added that fearless advocacy remained essential to the justice system, warning that when lawyers were forced to weigh personal safety against professional duty, the rule of law was weakened.</p>



<p>“It will not begin with us,” the firm declared, noting that it would deploy every lawful measure available to resist any attempt to intimidate counsel or undermine judicial proceedings.</p>



<p>It further called on the Nigerian Bar Association and lawyers globally to condemn what it described as an aberration and a gross violation of the legal profession.</p>



<p>The statement was jointly signed by the firm&#8217;s Management and Board of Partners.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the custody dispute continues to attract public attention, with fans and observers calling for peaceful co-parenting, even as both sides maintain their positions amid heightened public scrutiny.</p>

<p>Afrobeats singer, Simisola Kosoko, popularly known as Simi, has sparked controversy after calling for capital punishment for rapists.</p>



<p>Nigeria is currently in a sexual assault crisis, with multiple rape allegations being reported in different parts of the country in recent weeks.</p>



<p>Reacting on Tuesday night, Simi passionately appealed to citizens and the authorities to put an end to sexual assault against women.</p>



<p>“I’m sickkk of this. Stop raping women. They need to castrate rapists and burn them,” she wrote in a fierce X post.</p>



<p>However, her suggestion of capital punishment for rapists sparked a debate, with many arguing that the same should be given to false rape accusers.</p>



<p>Simi maintained that she was advocating for rape victims and not victims of false rape accusations, which further escalated the controversy.</p>



<p>Shunning the outrage from her male fans, the singer explained that she was advocating for rape victims because almost all the women she knew had been “sexually assaulted at some point in their lives.”</p>



<p>She argued that it isn’t right to stop people from speaking against sexual assault just because of false rape accusers.</p>



<p>“How many of your friends have actually assaulted women as vibes?? Women are terrified to go out. Women in their homes are not safe either. </p>



<p>&#8220;Ask your sisters. Ask your female friends and your girlfriends. Ask your wives. We’re not all crazy. Stop raping women,” she added.</p>



<p>Simi also urged men to hold their fellow men accountable, claiming that men create the enabling environment for rapists due to their failure to hold others accountable.</p>

<p>The Africa Prosperity Network (APN) and Air Algérie Group have signed a Co-operation Framework Agreement in Addis Ababa, deepening collaboration to promote the “Make Africa Borderless Now!” movement and accelerate Africa’s economic integration.</p>



<p>The agreement reinforces the shared commitment of both institutions to champion the free movement of people, goods and services across the continent, a key pillar for the effective implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).</p>



<p>Recognising air connectivity as a critical enabler of integration, the partnership will support initiatives aimed at enhancing intra-African mobility and strengthening trade and cargo flows across Africa.</p>



<p>Under the framework, the two parties will collaborate to facilitate participation in the Africa Prosperity Dialogues (APD) and other high-level convening platforms designed to drive policy alignment and economic cooperation. The agreement also provides a platform for structured policy dialogue, capacity building and advocacy efforts focused on dismantling barriers to trade, travel and economic activity.</p>



<p>The signing signals growing institutional backing for the Make Africa Borderless Now! movement, which is pushing for the practical implementation of existing continental integration agreements.</p>



<p>Organisers say the movement is aimed at unlocking Africa’s full economic potential by eliminating restrictions that limit intra-African trade and mobility, ultimately improving livelihoods across the continent and within the diaspora.</p>



<p>Members of the public are encouraged to support the campaign by signing the “Make Africa Borderless Now!” petition and adding their voices to the call for a more integrated and borderless Africa.</p>



<p>The Africa Prosperity Network is a Pan-African organisation focused on advancing economic integration, sustainable development and shared prosperity through strategic partnerships and policy advocacy initiatives across the continent.</p>

<p>The Africa Prosperity Network (APN) and Ethiopian Airlines have opened discussions on a strategic collaboration aimed at accelerating the “Make Africa Borderless Now!” agenda, a continental campaign pushing for the full implementation of Africa’s economic integration agreements.</p>



<p>The meeting, held at the airline’s headquarters in Addis Ababa on Monday, focused on promoting the free movement of people, goods and services across Africa, with air transport identified as a critical driver of integration and intra-African trade.</p>



<p>The campaign seeks to persuade African governments to implement key protocols already adopted, including the Free Movement of Persons, Right of Residence and Right of Establishment Protocol, and the Single Africa Air Transport Market (SAATM), both adopted in 2018 but yet to be fully operationalised across the continent.</p>



<p>APN used the meeting to invite Africa’s largest airline to become a major partner in the movement, which was launched in Accra earlier this month. The initiative aims to mobilise 10 million signatures to demand visa-free travel for Africans within Africa, implementation of the AfCFTA Digital Trade Protocol, and the broader removal of trade and travel barriers.</p>



<p>Group CEO of Ethiopian Airlines, Mesfin, expressed strong support for the initiative.</p>



<p>“We would like to be part of this initiative,” he said, acknowledging that visa restrictions remain a major obstacle to travel across the continent.</p>



<p>“Visa is an obstacle to travel. But the primary reason for visa restrictions across Africa is security, however, security should be ensured in a different way than limiting people from free movement. Because whenever people move, they do so with money for tourism, money for investments, or money to buy goods and services,” he stated.</p>



<p>While noting that a fully borderless Africa may not happen overnight, he stressed that progress could be accelerated through deliberate collaboration. He added that greater freedom of movement would significantly boost intra-African trade and air cargo volumes.</p>



<p>Executive Chairman and Founder of APN, Gabby Asare Otchere-Darko, emphasised the need for African central banks and regulators to enable continent-wide mobile money interoperability. This, he said, would allow Africans to transact seamlessly across borders using their mobile money wallets.</p>



<p>Addressing concerns about security under a visa-free regime, he pointed to the example of ECOWAS, which operates a biometric passport system enabling member states to track movement within the bloc.</p>



<p>“So even if it is visa-free, as long as there is a biometric ID, you can track people. ECOWAS has that, and the long-awaited AU passport can do that too,” he said, adding that Rwanda’s visa-free policy for Africans demonstrates that security concerns can be managed without restricting movement.</p>



<p>He also raised concerns about the slow pace of ratifying the Free Movement Protocol, noting that only four countries have signed on so far, short of the 15 required for it to come into force.</p>



<p>“It is not right that people from outside the continent have more access to Africa and African economic opportunities than Africans,” he said, stressing that more Africans currently travel by air outside the continent than within it.</p>



<p>The engagement signals growing momentum behind the Make Africa Borderless Now! movement, as stakeholders push to translate Africa’s integration ambitions into practical outcomes. Both parties indicated that further meetings will be held to define the scope of the potential partnership.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Several countries which have signed up to Donald Trump&#8217;s Board of Peace have contributed more than $7bn (£5.2bn) towards a Gaza &#8220;relief package&#8221;, the US president has said.</p>



<p>Trump made the announcement during the first meeting of the organisation that many of US&#8217;s Western allies have refused to join, fearing the body originally meant to help end the war between Israel and Hamas may be intended to replace the UN.</p>



<p>The second phase of a US-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan includes the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza.</p>



<p>It &#8220;looks like&#8221; Hamas would disarm, Trump told participants. However, there are few signs of the Palestinian group disarming. Gazans say it is extending its control over the Strip.</p>



<p>Speaking as the Board of Peace convened on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had &#8220;agreed with our ally the US there will be no reconstruction of Gaza before the demilitarisation of Gaza&#8221;.</p>



<p>The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p>



<p>Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 72,000 people have been killed, according to the territory&#8217;s Hamas-run health ministry.</p>



<p>The enclave&#8217;s economy is in ruins, with its buildings and infrastructure largely destroyed. The UN estimates the cost of damage at $70bn.</p>



<p>Countries including the UK, Canada, France and Germany have refused to join the Board of Peace that came into being last month.</p>



<p>In an effort to address concerns that the organisation was meant as a way of sidelining the UN, Trump told the board&#8217;s first meeting in Washington that &#8220;we&#8217;re going to be working with the United Nations very closely, we&#8217;re going to bring them back&#8221;.</p>



<p>Gaza, the US president said, was &#8220;no longer a hotbed of radicalism and terror&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;And to end that, we have today, and I&#8217;m pleased to announce that Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait have all contributed more than $7bn toward the relief package&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every dollar spent is an investment in stability,&#8221; he said, adding that the UN would contribute $2bn for humanitarian assistance, while football body Fifa would raise $75m for soccer-related projects in the Strip.</p>



<p>Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician who has been given the title of high representative for Gaza as part of the board, said the process of recruiting a new transitional Palestinian police force had begun and &#8220;just in the first few hours we have 2,000 people who have applied&#8221;.</p>



<p>But both Israel and the US have insisted that the force is not drawn from the existing Hamas-controlled police without stringent vetting, nor do they want it simply made up of the security forces of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.</p>



<p>That means starting from scratch, and the task is daunting.</p>



<p>Mladenov has previously said the Palestinian police force must by the primary security agency in Gaza, assisted by the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), and not vice-versa.</p>



<p>According to the US plan, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas.</p>



<p>But Mladenov said there is little evidence such a force could yet oversee the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian factions.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, there was no indication at the meeting that Hamas was prepared to hand over its weapons, despite Trump&#8217;s combination of optimism and threat on this point.</p>



<p>So far, Hamas has publicly appeared to make handing over weapons contingent on &#8211; at least &#8211; Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p>



<p>Progress on this issue is critical because none of Trump&#8217;s proposals for reconstruction and governance can take place without a security force on the ground that has broad backing of the Palestinian population, given its role includes assuming a monopoly of force within Gaza.</p>



<p>The Washington meeting itself was characteristic of Trump&#8217;s approach to Israeli-Palestinian peace-making over his two terms &#8211; involving a future for Palestinians seen often through the lens of real-estate development and wealthy investor funding.</p>



<p>Meanwhile Israel&#8217;s leadership has been wary about some of Trump&#8217;s efforts, particularly the invitations to his board for Turkey and Qatar, whom Israel does not want to see take a prominent role in decisions on the future of Gaza.</p>



<p>Trump and his team have defended his unconventional approach saying it amounts to &#8220;new thinking&#8221; to try to solve the conflict.</p>



<p>However, Mladenov has warned that without rapid progress, Gaza will remain split into two territories, one under continuing Israeli occupation and the other under Hamas control &#8211; and also split from the West Bank, making a future independent state unviable and failing to secure either Palestinians or Israelis.</p>

<p>The Bono Regional Police Command has recovered five assorted firearms and shot dead a suspected robber during an intelligence-led operation in the Region.  </p>



<p>A press release issued by Chief Inspector Thomas Akeelah, Public Relations Officer of the Command, and copied to the Ghana News Agency, said police intelligence gathered on February 11, 2026,&nbsp;indicated&nbsp;that a gang had planned to attack traders travelling along the&nbsp;Dormaa-Gonokrom&nbsp;highway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;It said surveillance teams were&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;deployed to thwart the planned robbery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“In the early hours of February 12, 2026, officers advancing near a parked motorbike came under gunfire from nearby bushes. Police returned fire and, at daybreak, found one male suspect dead with an AK47 rifle beside him,” the release said.&nbsp;</p>



<p> The release said a further search led to the recovery of a sack containing additional weapons and ammunition, including two Baikal single-barrelled guns, a pump-action gun, and one Beretta pistol loaded with three 9mm rounds and 34 9mm rounds. </p>



<p> Police also recovered one AK-47 rifle loaded with 11 rounds of ammunition and 10 additional rounds, 39 rounds of BB cartridges, one dagger, a mobile phone, a Honda motorbike, a black mask and a set of talismans. </p>



<p>&nbsp;“The body of the deceased has been deposited at the Police Hospital morgue for preservation, identification and autopsy,” the release said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The Command assured the public that efforts were underway to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;and arrest the remaining gang members to face justice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;It appealed to the public to provide credible information to support ongoing efforts to enhance safety and security in the Region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Adabraka District Court has fined a driver 50 penalty units, equivalent to GH¢600, for careless and inconsiderate driving that resulted in the injury of a passenger. </p>



<p>Evans Amankwa admitted that&nbsp;he drove&nbsp;carelessly&nbsp;and negligently,&nbsp;causing&nbsp;harm to Edmund Wisdom Azumah Kwaku, the passenger.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Giving the facts, Inspector Irene Sackey said that on February 2, 2026, at about 2207 hours, Amankwa was in charge of a Daewoo Matiz Saloon car with registration number GW 920-20, travelling from Lapaz towards Kasoa.  </p>



<p>On reaching a section of the road at the McCarthy Hill Traffic Light whilst moving from the service lane to link the highway, he did not exercise due care and, in the process, entered the middle lane.  </p>



<p>As a result, an articulated truck from the Odorkor direction ran into the rear of the car. The impact pushed the vehicle into the opposite lane and crushed it into a trailer from the Kasoa direction, the court heard.  </p>



<p>The driver and the passenger&nbsp;of the Daewoo Matiz&nbsp;sustained injuries and were rushed to the Weija-Gbawe&nbsp;Municipal&nbsp;Hospital for treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the investigation, he was charged with the offences to appear before court, Inspector Sackey said, adding that he paid for the medical expenses of the passenger. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Kumawu District Police have arrested Kofi Dougan, a pharmacist at the Kumawu Government Hospital in the Ashanti Region, for allegedly assaulting a medical officer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dougan, who was detained overnight, had been granted bail after allegedly assaulting Dr Fred Twene Amankwaa at the Emergency Unit of the Hospital. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A source at the Kumawu Police Command said on February 15, 2026, Dr Amankwaa reported to the station and lodged an assault case against the pharmacist, Kofi Dougan.  </p>



<p>Wearing a torn uniform and with bruises on his face, Dr Amankwaa said he was abused by Dougan when he visited the pharmacy to pick up a prescription on behalf of a patient.   </p>



<p>He said being in-charge of the emergency unit, he attended to a patient on admission, but due to the seriousness of the case he decided to personally visit the pharmacy to pick the prescription. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The complainant said Dougan claimed he (Dr Amankwaa) had no business picking the prescription.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The source said that led to a misunderstanding between the two, during which&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dougan allegedly assaulted Dr Amankwaa, leaving him with a torn dress and bruises.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The pharmacist, according to the complainant,  was demanding outright payment for the services, contrary to management’s policy, even if the patient is not NHIS accredited, ” the source said.  </p>



<p>During the incident, some staff members of the hospital intervened.  </p>



<p>&nbsp;Dr Amankwaa was subsequently  issued with a police medical report form while the suspect was arrested and detained.  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dougan confirmed the incident but denied assaulting Dr Amankwaa.  </p>



<p>The Police are expected to put him before court after investigations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Samuel Nartey George, the Minister of Communications, Digital Technology and Innovations, has clarified that not all the women whose images were circulated by the Russian national had intimate encounters with him.</p>



<p>“Not all the women he publicised were engaged in any intimate encounter with him. In some cases, he barely met them at malls, said ‘hi’ and engaged them briefly,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr George was speaking at a joint press briefing in Accra on Wednesday with Dr Agnes Naa Momo Lartey, the Minister of Gender, Children and Social Protection, to provide updates on investigations into the unlawful publication of intimate images.</p>



<p>He described the suspect’s actions as “evil” and said preliminary investigations by the Cyber Security Authority had found that, in several instances, there was no evidence of any intimate relationship beyond brief public interactions.</p>



<p>“In some cases, there is actually no video evidence beyond the mall encounters. However, he published their images as though he had intimate encounters with all of them,” he stated.</p>



<p>Mr George said the misrepresentation had caused serious harm and stressed that the suspect must face the full rigour of the law.</p>



<p>He noted that although Ghana did not have a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) with Russia, the Government was activating international law enforcement mechanisms, including INTERPOL, to secure an international arrest warrant.</p>



<p>He explained that while the Russian Constitution did not permit the extradition of its citizens, an international arrest warrant would restrict the suspect’s movement outside Russia.</p>



<p>“As soon as he steps outside Russia into any other country, he will be arrested to serve his sentence. Our proactive action has helped protect potential future victims,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr George rejected calls for inaction, stressing that failure to act would encourage similar offences.</p>



<p>“As a government, we have a responsibility to protect our citizens and ensure that anyone who violates our privacy laws under the Cybersecurity Act faces the full consequences,” he added.</p>



<p>Dr Lartey, on her part, said the incident had caused severe emotional and psychological trauma to the affected women, some of whom had no intimate contact with the suspect.</p>



<p>She urged the public to exercise restraint and empathy in discussing the matter, warning that insensitive commentary could further traumatise the victims.</p>



<p>Dr Lartey assured the victims of government’s support, including professional psychosocial services for them and their families.</p>



<p>She encouraged affected persons to contact the Ministry, with a guarantee of strict confidentiality.</p>

<p>Government has initiated legal processes to prosecute a Russian national accused of non-consensually recording and disseminating intimate images of Ghanaian women, even if he is not extradited to Ghana.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He said investigations by the Cyber Security Authority and law enforcement agencies indicated that the suspect allegedly recorded private encounters without consent for publication and&nbsp;monetised&nbsp;the content online, charging fees and receiving payments through cryptocurrency channels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr George said the Cyber Security Authority was preparing a docket through the Ghana Police Service and the Attorney-General’s Department for prosecution in absentia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are also preparing through the Cyber Security Authority to present a docket through the Police Service and Attorney-General for prosecution in absentia in our courts,”&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He noted that in view of the transnational nature of the case, the two ministries had formally briefed the Russian Ambassador to Ghana, Sergei&nbsp;Berdnikov, and submitted a detailed report through diplomatic channels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr George said the Ambassador acknowledged receipt of the briefing and confirmed that the information received would be transmitted to the appropriate authorities in Moscow for further consideration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although there was no extradition treaty between Ghana and the Russian Federation, the Ambassador said the alleged conduct constituted a criminal&nbsp;offence&nbsp;under Russian law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mr George said the Government was working with INTERPOL to activate international arrest warrant protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He explained that even if the suspect was not extradited due to provisions of the Russian Constitution, an international arrest warrant would restrict his movement beyond Russia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As soon as he steps outside of Russia into any other country, he will be picked up to serve the sentence,”&nbsp;he stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Lartey, on her part, reiterated government’s determination to pursue the matter to its logical legal conclusion to ensure justice for the affected women. </p>



<p>“The assurance we are giving all Ghanaians is that nobody will violate any Ghanaian citizen and go scot-free,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are going to pursue it. And that is the charge John Dramani Mahama has given us.” </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The first detailed genetic map of cancer in pet cats reveals striking similarities with human cancers, potentially helping identify new ways to treat both.</p>



<p>Scientists analysed tumour DNA from almost 500 domestic cats, uncovering key genetic mutations linked with the condition.</p>



<p>Cancer is one of the main causes of illness and death in cats; however, very little is known about how it develops.</p>



<p>&#8220;Cat cancer genetics has totally been a black box up until now,&#8221; said lead researcher, Dr Louise Van der Wayden. &#8220;The more we can understand about cancer in any species, the more beneficial it is for everybody.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6670/live/f1568790-0da9-11f1-9fe5-57999fe11004.jpg.webp" alt="Getty A cat with a plastic collar rests on a wooden floor. The cat has chocolate fur and big blue eyes." style="width:840px;height:auto" title="Cats may hold clues for human cancer treatment"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Understanding the genetic basis of cancer in cats can lead to better treatments</figcaption></figure>



<p>The international team led by the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge&nbsp;</a>examined around 1,000 genes linked to 13 types of feline cancer.</p>



<p>They found many of the genes driving cat cancers are mirrored in humans, suggesting the two species share key biological processes that allow tumours to grow and spread.</p>



<p>The scientists say the household cat could hold the key to understanding certain types of breast cancer, such as triple negative breast cancer. Around 15 out of 100 breast cancers are of this type.</p>



<p>Cats develop this subtype more often than humans, giving scientists access to samples and offering clues to new medicines that might help in treatment.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/36cc/live/647acf80-0d9e-11f1-8168-03d32f3820eb.jpg.webp" alt="Getty Images A vet in blue scrubs holds a tortoiseshell and white kitten in their arms. The kitten looks directly at the camera." style="width:840px;height:auto" title="Cats may hold clues for human cancer treatment"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cancer is one of the leading causes of illness in cats</figcaption></figure>



<p>Almost a quarter of UK households own at least one cat, making the animal almost as popular as dogs as a trusted companion.</p>



<p>But while cancer studies have been carried out extensively in dogs, cats have remained unexplored.</p>



<p>The scientists say both household pets could give clues to environmental factors involved in some types of cancer.</p>



<p>They share the same spaces as us, meaning that they are also exposed to the same environmental factors that we are.</p>



<p>&#8220;This can help us understand more about why cancer develops in cats and humans, how the world around us influences cancer risk, and possibly find new ways to prevent and treat it,&#8221; said Prof Geoffrey Wood of the Ontario Veterinary College, Canada.</p>



<p>The research is published in the journal <a href="https://www.science.org/journal/science" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Science</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[I’m always surprised watching children grow. Watching my own children grow is a constant astonishment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m always surprised watching children grow. Watching my own children grow is a constant astonishment.</p>



<p>Every day, I find myself overwhelmed by the simple, miraculous passage of their lives, from one stage to the next.</p>



<p>I wonder endlessly: what do children think about? What is happening in those little minds when they reach out, when they smile? What does it mean to them? Even observing the smallest milestones—the moment they lift their necks, the first hesitant reach of their hands, the way they sit up, steadying themselves, learning balance—I am reminded that life itself is extraordinary.</p>



<p>Then comes crawling—the first shuddering push of legs and arms, the little gasp when they realise they can actually move toward something—they erupt with discovery.</p>



<p>Every tumble, every hesitant reach, is an announcement: “I can do this. I am learning.” And then standing with support, holding onto furniture or your hands, rocking back and forth as if rehearsing the world, testing their balance.</p>



<p>And then—oh, the first step. That one moment is not to be missed. The sort of joy it brings, the laughter, the applause, the tears that threaten to fall—it’s pure elation. One tiny foot in front of the other, wobbling, unsure, and yet determined.</p>



<p>In that instant, the world feels impossibly vast and full of possibility, and you are there, helpless and amazed, watching your child take it all in.</p>



<p>Not forgetting those early babbles, the tentative sounds before the first words tumble out—it’s as though the world itself is teaching them how to speak, how to be, how to claim their place in it. Every new word is a revelation. Every laugh, every cry, every curious glance, is a glimpse into a universe I will never fully understand.</p>



<p>I watch my children, and I think: God is truly amazing. Because to witness the emergence of thought, the unfolding of personality, the raw, unfiltered wonder in a child’s eyes—there is nothing else quite like it.</p>



<p>It’s a reminder that growth, however small or slow it seems, is sacred. And that in the ordinary moments, the miraculous is quietly, insistently happening.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Founder and CEO of Jacob West Limited, Michael Kyei-Ayensu, has candidly detailed the unexpected hurdles he faced after relocating from the United Kingdom to establish his business in Ghana, revealing that adapting to the local business environment proved far more complex than anticipated.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Founder and CEO of Jacob West Limited, Michael Kyei-Ayensu, has candidly detailed the unexpected hurdles he faced after relocating from the United Kingdom to establish his business in Ghana, revealing that adapting to the local business environment proved far more complex than anticipated.</p>



<p>Speaking on <em><strong>Personality Profile with Lexis Bill on Joy FM</strong></em>, the diaspora entrepreneur said his early years in Ghana were marked by difficult adjustments, despite his prior success in the UK property and finance space.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0YUqqhpocRU?si=AJ3ZfL9dOksYhHcr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p><strong>High expectations meet harsh reality</strong></p>



<p>Reflecting on the transition period, Mr Kyei-Ayensu, who was a guest on the show on Thursday, February 19, admitted he initially underestimated the depth of structural and cultural differences between the two business environments.</p>



<p>“At the beginning stages…I didn&#8217;t expect this,” he said during the interview.</p>



<p>Pressed on what exactly surprised him, the Jacob West boss explained that Ghana’s business ecosystem operates very differently from the systems-driven model he was used to in Britain.</p>



<p>&#8220;It runs on emotions and culture, rather than systems and processes. And I didn&#8217;t understand that at the beginning stages.”</p>



<p><strong>UK playbook didn’t translate easily</strong></p>



<p>Before relocating, Mr Kyei-Ayensu and his brother had built a business in the UK, where structured financing, predictable regulations, and data-driven decision-making shaped operations. That experience led him to believe the same formula could be replicated locally.</p>



<p>“And I felt as though, as long as I implement what I&#8217;ve learned in the UK, in Ghana, I&#8217;ll be fine. Right?” he recounted.</p>



<p>However, he quickly discovered that success in Ghana required a different strategic approach, one that blended formal systems with relationship management and deep cultural understanding.</p>



<p><strong>Starting from scratch again</strong></p>



<p>Mr Kyei-Ayensu noted that one of the biggest shocks was entering a market where he lacked the institutional knowledge and networks that had supported his earlier ventures abroad.</p>



<p>“In the UK, we set up business with zero. There was no investment. It was ideas. And it became a business,” he explained.</p>



<p>Confident from that experience, he initially believed the Ghana move would follow a similar trajectory.</p>



<p>“So I said, &#8216;I can do this&#8217;. But then we understood the system [in the UK], and we knew where, if we started, we could navigate ourselves to get to where we needed to get to.”</p>



<p>That confidence, he admitted, met its toughest test upon arrival in Ghana.</p>



<p>“But in Ghana, we didn&#8217;t know the system. We didn&#8217;t understand the process.”</p>



<p><strong>Building Jacob West against the odds</strong></p>



<p>Despite the early turbulence, Mr Kyei-Ayensu has since grown Jacob West into a recognised Ghanaian real estate and property advisory firm, known for mortgage brokerage, property investment guidance and diaspora-focused housing solutions.</p>



<p>Industry observers credit the company with helping bridge financing gaps for many first-time homeowners and diaspora investors seeking property opportunities in Ghana.</p>



<p>Business analysts say his journey mirrors a common diaspora challenge, where the assumption is that technical expertise alone guarantees success back home.</p>



<p><strong>Lessons for returning diaspora entrepreneurs</strong></p>



<p>Mr Kyei-Ayensu stressed that, beyond capital and technical knowledge, returning entrepreneurs must invest time in understanding local business culture and regulatory pathways.</p>



<p>His experience underscores a broader policy conversation about improving ease of doing business and formalising systems within Ghana’s private sector environment.</p>



<p>Today, he says the early setbacks have become valuable learning tools that shaped Jacob West’s growth strategy and resilience.</p>



<p>For many diaspora professionals eyeing a return home, his story serves both as inspiration and caution: global experience is valuable, but local intelligence is indispensable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Abdul-Aziz Iddrisu, also known as Baaluuse, the alleged killer of General Constable Seth Oppong-Damoah, has been re-arrested.</p>



<p>A police brief issued on Tuesday said that at about 1230 hours, personnel from the National Police Intelligence Directorate (NPID), Accra, in collaboration with their counterparts in the Upper East Region, apprehended the 33-year-old suspect during a joint intelligence-led operation.</p>



<p>He was arrested at his hideout at Polego, a suburb of Bolgatanga.</p>



<p>The brief said the suspect and his accomplices, who were yet to be arrested, had been on the police wanted list for allegedly attacking officers at the Kariminga Police Barrier.</p>



<p>During the incident, General Constable Seth Oppong-Damoah was shot dead, while General Corporals Nyanku Charles and Abu Moro sustained fatal injuries.</p>



<p>The brief said Abdul-Aziz had been identified as a warrior for one of the feuding factions in the Bawku conflict.</p>



<p>A search conducted on three mobile phones retrieved from the suspect suggested that he and others, still at large, had actively participated in the protracted Bawku conflict and were allegedly involved in multiple killings.</p>



<p>Further examination of the phones reportedly revealed that Abdul-Aziz belonged to a WhatsApp group named: “Trusted Friends,” which displayed the image of Alhaji Seidu Abagri, a rival chief in the Bawku chieftaincy dispute, as its profile picture.</p>



<p>The group was said to be mainly patronised by members of the Mamprusi and Moshie communities.</p>



<p>Police said the suspect was seen in a video displaying a number of AK-47 assault rifles in a sack and pistols at a location believed to be in Bawku.</p>



<p>He was also captured in an audio message allegedly requesting more arms and ammunition to enable the Mamprusis defeat the Kusaasis in the ongoing conflict.</p>



<p>Information available to the police further indicated that the suspect and another individual, identified only as Mark, currently at large, were believed to be behind the importation of weapons and ammunition into Bawku.</p>



<p>The brief added that on December 29, 2025, the suspect and his accomplices allegedly planned and launched the attack on officers performing their lawful duties at the Kariminga Barrier.</p>



<p>Police said Abdul-Aziz went into hiding after the incident but was later traced to his hideout and arrested.</p>

<p>A 24-year-old&nbsp;motor rider&nbsp;has been remanded into prison custody by the&nbsp;Toase&nbsp;District Court in the&nbsp;Atwima&nbsp;Nwabiagya&nbsp;South Municipality of the Ashanti region,&nbsp;for&nbsp;allegedly&nbsp;killing&nbsp;an&nbsp;illegal&nbsp;miner at&nbsp;Manso-Moseaso.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plea of Benjamin Kwakye&nbsp;was&nbsp;not&nbsp;taken,&nbsp;and he will be brought&nbsp;back&nbsp;before the court on&nbsp;March&nbsp;03, 2026,&nbsp;as prosecution awaits&nbsp;advice from the Attorney General’s&nbsp;Office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Police Inspector Kwaku Frimpong, prosecuting, told the court presided over by Mr Robert Addo that the complainant in the case was a 52-year-old father of Prince Amankwaa Tagoe, the deceased. </p>



<p>He said the&nbsp;suspect&nbsp;and&nbsp;his brother,&nbsp;Paa&nbsp;Kwasi,&nbsp;together with&nbsp;the deceased,&nbsp;who was&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend,&nbsp;resided&nbsp;in the same house&nbsp;at&nbsp;Manso-Moseaso&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Amansie&nbsp;West District.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On March 03, 2025, Paa Kwasi’s money went missing, and he suspected that the suspect and his friend, the deceased, had conspired and stolen it, so he sacked the deceased from the house. </p>



<p>The deceased questioned&nbsp;the&nbsp;suspect&nbsp;about the whereabouts&nbsp;of the money,&nbsp;but&nbsp;this generated a&nbsp;quarrel&nbsp;resulting&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;physical&nbsp;fight.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On August 05, 2025, the two met at a chop bar and fought again, and this time, the deceased threatened to kill the suspect. </p>



<p>However, the suspect took an axe and threw it at the deceased’s head, so he fell unconscious and bled profusely. </p>



<p>The&nbsp;suspect then&nbsp;fled into&nbsp;hiding,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;deceased was rushed to the&nbsp;Asuowin&nbsp;Health Centre,&nbsp;where he was pronounced dead upon arrival.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A report was made to the Asuowin police, and on February 13, this year, Kwakye was arrested from his hideout at Dadiesoaba in the Ahafo region. </p>



<p>In his caution statement, he admitted the offence, and after further investigations, he was charged and brought before the court. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Jacob West Ltd, Michael Kyei-Ayensu, has revealed that the devastating 2008 global financial crisis forced him to abandon a UK business and return to Ghana to rebuild from scratch.</p>



<p>Speaking on <strong>Personality Profile</strong> with <strong>Lexis Bill</strong> on <strong>Joy FM</strong>, the Ghanaian entrepreneur recounted how the credit crunch wiped out much of the progress he and his brother had made in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p><strong>UK success derailed by global recession</strong></p>



<p>Mr Kyei-Ayensu, who was a guest on the show on Thursday, February 19, said his UK-based property and financial services business was performing strongly until the global downturn struck.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0YUqqhpocRU?si=AJ3ZfL9dOksYhHcr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“Although we were doing very well in the UK… the latter part of 2007, 2008, there was this beast of a credit crunch, like the whole world,” he explained.</p>



<p>According to him, the downturn was swift and brutal, collapsing deal flow almost overnight.</p>



<p>“It was crazy. Like what we were achieving became less than 1% of what we were achieving,” he said.</p>



<p>He noted that while more experienced entrepreneurs had seen similar cycles before, he and his brother were unprepared for the scale of the disruption.</p>



<p>“But for us, we had no clue. We didn&#8217;t have any idea how we&#8217;re going to navigate this issue.”</p>



<p><strong>Heavy losses and business collapse</strong></p>



<p>The impact was severe. Mr Kyei-Ayensu disclosed that the crisis forced them to surrender multiple properties and lose significant equity.</p>



<p>“We lost quite a few properties,” he told the programme.</p>



<p>Pressed on the extent of the damage, he added, &#8220;Down in terms of losing properties, three to four properties with all equity.”</p>



<p>The operational slowdown was equally dramatic. Weekly business volumes plunged from about 20 transactions to just one.</p>



<p>“Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re doing 20 cases a week. It became one case a week. That&#8217;s how bad it was,” he revealed.</p>



<p>He attributed the collapse largely to tightening credit conditions in the UK banking sector.</p>



<p>“Literally, banks were pulling financial products from the market, which doesn&#8217;t allow us to brokerage.”</p>



<p><strong>Decision to return to Ghana</strong></p>



<p>Faced with shrinking opportunities and mounting losses, Mr Kyei-Ayensu said he and his brother made a decisive strategic pivot.</p>



<p>“It was literally from hero to zero. And it was tough. And then from that point on, our minds were like, let&#8217;s get out of here.”</p>



<p>Their conclusion was clear and immediate: “Let&#8217;s get out of here. Let&#8217;s try Ghana. Let&#8217;s try Ghana.”</p>



<p>The move marked the beginning of what would later become one of Ghana’s emerging indigenous real estate and property advisory brands.</p>



<p><strong>Building Jacob West in Ghana</strong></p>



<p>Since relocating, Mr Kyei-Ayensu has focused on building Jacob West Ltd into a player in Ghana’s real estate brokerage and property services space.</p>



<p>Industry observers note that his return coincided with Ghana’s post-2008 property expansion, driven by urbanisation, diaspora investment and rising demand for formal housing in Accra and other major cities.</p>



<p>Under his leadership, the company has positioned itself around:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Property brokerage</li>



<li>Real estate advisory</li>



<li>Investment support services</li>



<li>Market intelligence for property buyers</li>
</ul>



<p>Mr Kyei-Ayensu is widely regarded within Ghana’s property circles as part of a new generation of returnee entrepreneurs who brought diaspora experience back home following the global financial crisis.</p>



<p>Reflecting on the experience, the Jacob West CEO suggested the UK setback ultimately reshaped his entrepreneurial outlook and risk appetite.</p>



<p>The crisis, he implied, forced a strategic rethink about geography, resilience and long-term opportunity, lessons that continue to inform his business philosophy in Ghana’s evolving real estate market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Lion DNA has been used to successfully prosecute poachers for the first time in the world, it has emerged.</p>



<p>Wildlife crime experts have only just revealed how they identified the individual animal from body parts found in a suspect&#8217;s village: they matched a profile in Zimbabwe&#8217;s lion database.</p>



<p>A blood sample had previously been taken from the male lion, which was being tracked by authorities in Hwange National Park, using a radio collar.</p>



<p>Two poachers were convicted for the 2024 incident and sent to prison in what is thought to be the first prosecution of its kind.</p>



<p>The details of the convictions and the role the DNA database played have been previously unknown.</p>



<p>Non-governmental organisation (NGO) Traffic, which works to combat the illegal trade in wildlife, has shared the details with us.</p>



<p>In May 2024, authorities in Hwange National Park became suspicious after a radio collar worn by a male lion stopped working.</p>



<p>Investigators and police traced its last known location and found a snare with lion fur attached.</p>



<p>After collecting forensic evidence, they questioned two men in a nearby village and discovered three sacks of meat, 16 lion claws and four teeth. These body parts would later be tested against the database, with the DNA from all of them matching the profile of the missing lion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d703/live/20c11050-fc42-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp" alt="TRACE, Simon Dures A man wearing blue rubber gloves, with his arms in a special air filtration cabinet is holding a white, liquid sampling device.

<p>But possessing lion parts is not necessarily a crime in Zimbabwe.</p>



<p>Having them can be explained away as old, traditional ornaments or as coming from an animal that died of natural causes.</p>



<p>This has been an obstacle to prosecutions in the past.</p>



<p>But thanks to a breakthrough in DNA profiling, that&#8217;s now changed.</p>



<p>The lab generated a DNA profile from the recovered body parts and compared this to the profile previously generated from a blood sample of the lion with the radio collar.</p>



<p>The two profiles matched and scientists were able to identify the specific missing animal.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/39bc/live/37c0d520-fc46-11f0-a8b8-bdd2c5f9bcad.jpg.webp" alt="TRACE, Simon Dures A man in a white coat stands to the right of the picture with his back to the camera.  He is in a dark corner of a room with walls painted in a light yellow colour.  The room has a noticeboard on the wall to his left beyond a door.  At the top of the noticeboard a sign reads &quot;Lab actions and Projects&quot;." style="width:840px;height:auto" title="Lion DNA helps convict poachers for first time"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The scientist was able to match the two DNA profiles</figcaption></figure>



<p>Over the last eight years, the Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust (VFWT) has received about £250,000 from the People&#8217;s Postcode Lottery in the UK to build up the DNA database of lions in Zimbabwe.</p>



<p>The scientist at the trust, who made the discovery, asked to remain anonymous for his own safety, but said:</p>



<p>&#8220;Before we had access to this technology, we were only able to do species identification, but sometimes that&#8217;s not enough.</p>



<p>&#8220;We can essentially match those claws or those products to the lion of interest that we are looking for.&#8221;</p>



<p>Within 10 days of the killing, the DNA evidence was presented in court.</p>



<p>Two men pleaded guilty and were given 24-month prison sentences.</p>



<p>The hearing was told the lion&#8217;s value was about $20,000.</p>



<p>Richard Scobey, Traffic&#8217;s executive director, said, &#8220;Countries now have the forensic capability to bring solid science-based evidence to court,&#8221; and that it will have a global impact.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/275d/live/fc23fb60-fc5d-11f0-9972-d3f265c101c6.jpg.webp" alt="TRAFFIC, Viv Williams On the left hand side of the image is a clear plastic bag which is full of lion bones and bone fragments.  On the right a display case contains lion teeth and claws with silver fittings for use as jewellery." style="width:840px;height:auto" title="Lion DNA helps convict poachers for first time"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lion bones are sold for use in traditional Chinese medicine. Teeth and claws are bought as jewellery</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is understood to be the first time that DNA from an individual lion has been identified and used to prosecute poachers.</p>



<p>Professor Rob Ogden has been closely involved in setting up the project and is co- founder of the organisation Trace, which promotes the use of forensic science in wildlife law enforcement.</p>



<p>He says the prosecution gives &#8220;a message of hope&#8221; and shows what can be done using a combination of training, research and development and forensic casework.</p>



<p>Recent figures suggest an increase in the number of lions being killed for their body parts which are then sold both as cultural objects in Africa and for traditional Chinese medicine.</p>



<p>It is thought the rise may be down to organised crime gangs also involved in the illegal trade in Rhino horn and ivory trafficking.</p>



<p>In Mozambique between 2010 and 2023, 426 lions were killed as a result of contact with humans with a quarter linked to deliberate poaching.</p>



<p>A measure of the scale of the trade is also the number of seizures by the authorities in recent years.</p>



<p>That includes 17 lion skulls found in Lusaka in 2021, reportedly en route from South Africa, and a 2023 seizure in Maputo of more than 300kg of lion body parts.</p>



<p>This breakthrough in DNA identification is seen as sending an important message to would-be poachers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A total of 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited to fight for Russia, according to a Kenyan intelligence report that details a network of rogue officials allegedly colluding with human trafficking syndicates.</p>



<p>The report, submitted to parliament on Wednesday by Kenya&#8217;s National Intelligence Service (NIS), said 89 Kenyans were on the front lines of the Russia–Ukraine war as of February this year.</p>



<p>At least one Kenyan has died, while several others have returned home injured or traumatised, it added.</p>



<p>The Kenyan government, which previously estimated that about 200 of its nationals had been recruited to fight for Russia,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0k1jzvrykro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wants Moscow to bar the conscription of Kenyan soldiers.</a></p>



<p>Presenting the report to MPs, parliament majority leader Kimani Ichung&#8217;wah, revealed what he termed a &#8220;deeply disturbing&#8221; network of rogue state officials allegedly colluding with human trafficking syndicates to recruit and transport Kenyans to fight in the Russia–Ukraine war.</p>



<p>The spy agency detailed how recruitment agencies have allegedly been colluding with rogue Kenyan airport staff, immigration officers, officers at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), anti-narcotics officers and National Employment Authority officers to facilitate recruits&#8217; travel.</p>



<p>Ichung&#8217;wah alleged that the agencies had also been colluding with staff at the Russian embassy in Nairobi and the Kenyan embassy in Moscow to help recruits get Russian visas.</p>



<p>In a statement on Thursday, the Russian embassy in Nairobi dismissed the allegations as &#8220;dangerous and misleading&#8221;, saying that its staff has never been involved in &#8220;rogue schemes&#8221; or engaged in illegal enlistment.</p>



<p>&#8220;At no point in time throughout the ongoing crisis in Ukraine [has] the Embassy ever issued visas to Kenyan citizens who sought to travel to Russia with the stated pose of participating in the Special Military Operation (SMO) in Ukraine.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nor the Embassy been encouraging any Kenyan citizen to do so.&#8221;</p>



<p>The embassy added that while it does not recruit foreigners, Russian law allows foreign nationals who are legally in Russia to voluntarily enlist in their armed forces.</p>



<p>While in parliament, Ichung&#8217;wah said that Kenya&#8217;s ambassador to Moscow &#8220;must be able to identify the officers within the embassy that may have colluded with these criminals. Our embassy must be beyond reproach. It must be the place where Kenyans can seek refuge, not exploitation.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Government offices are not to be used for criminal activities,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>The BBC has asked the Kenyan foreign ministry for comment.</p>



<p>The report did not say what had happened to the majority of the recruits but said that in addition to those on the front line, another 35 had been sent to military camps in Russia, 39 are injured and 28 are missing.</p>



<p>According to the investigation, ex-military personnel, ex-police officers and unemployed Kenyans aged 20–50 are the main targets of the recruiters.</p>



<p>Recruits are promised a monthly pay of up to 350,000 Kenyan shillings ($2,400; £2,000), with bonuses ranging from KSh 900,000 to KSh 1.2 million ($6,200–$8,300;£5,200–£7,000).</p>



<p>However, upon arrival, many reportedly find themselves deployed to front-line combat roles after minimal military training.</p>



<p>&#8220;They are told you are going to work as a guard… only to get there and you are taken to military camps,&#8221; Ichung&#8217;wah said.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve only trained for three weeks. They are basically just giving you a gun to go and die,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>Those undergoing explosives and weapons training are only required to attend training for nine days before being sent to the front line, the report said.</p>



<p>Ichung&#8217;wah said that, initially, recruits departed through Nairobi&#8217;s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) using tourist visas and travelled through Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>



<p>However, with heightened surveillance at JKIA, traffickers reportedly changed tactics, rerouting victims through South Africa, Uganda and other neighbouring states.</p>



<p>The report identified some of the rogue agencies behind the recruitment of Kenyans and the medical facilities used for testing.</p>



<p>Authorities say several suspects, including the alleged mastermind, remain under active investigation, with further arrests expected. Investigations continue as officials seek additional suspects and work to rescue Kenyans still caught in the conflict.</p>



<p>Speaking to the BBC last week, Kenya&#8217;s Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi said Nairobi had shut down more than 600 recruitment agencies suspected of duping Kenyans with promises of jobs overseas.</p>



<p>Mudavadi said Kenya was working closely with Russia to curb illegal recruitment practices, including discussions on visa policy and bilateral labour agreements that exclude military conscription.</p>



<p>The foreign minister is due to visit Moscow next month to discuss the matter.</p>



<p>So far, 27 Kenyans who had been fighting in Russia have been repatriated, he said, with authorities providing psychological care to address their trauma and &#8220;de-radicalise&#8221; them.</p>



<p>Pressure has been mounting on the Kenyan government to act after the recent discovery of more bodies of nationals of African countries who had been recruited to fight for the Russian armed forces.</p>



<p>Last November, Ukraine&#8217;s foreign minister said that more than 1,400 people from 36 countries in Africa had been recruited to fight for Russia.</p>



<p>Ukraine has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.</p>



<p>Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gr54n8260o" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Police in South Africa have arrested the youngest son of Zimbabwe&#8217;s late former President Robert Mugabe, who is facing a charge of attempted murder after a reported shooting at a property in an upmarket suburb of Johannesburg.</p>



<p>Bellarmine Mugabe, 28, was taken into custody after a 23-year-old man, believed to be a gardener, was shot and injured.</p>



<p>Officers searching the house in Hyde Park, where Mugabe was staying, have found bullet cartridges but no firearm, police have said.</p>



<p>Bellarmine Mugabe is the youngest son of Robert and his second wife Grace Mugabe. Robert Mugabe, who died in 2019, led Zimbabwe for 37 years before being forced out of power at the age of 93 in 2017.</p>



<p>One other man has been arrested alongside Bellarmine Mugabe as investigators continue their work, police spokesperson Col Dimakatso Nevhuhulwi said.</p>



<p>The pair are expected to appear in court &#8220;soon&#8221;, according to a police statement.</p>



<p>Police are not yet officially naming Bellarmine Mugabe as one of those arrested, but reporters at the scene saw him in handcuffs, and he has been widely named by local media.</p>



<p>The victim is in hospital and in a critical condition after being shot once, the spokesperson added.</p>



<p>In a briefing outside the property, Nevhuhulwi said the two suspects have not &#8220;told us where the gun is, they are not saying anything about the gun&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minority Caucus in Parliament has rejected the proposed Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025, describing it as deeply flawed and overly centralising power in the Presidency.</p>



<p>In a statement dated February 18 and signed by Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin, the caucus said while it supports reforms to modernise Ghana’s national security architecture, it cannot support the bill in its current form.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ej4E6KqEbKg?si=O93bkzJ_FBZB_qtm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“Let me be clear. The Minority Caucus supports the need to reform Ghana’s national security architecture,” the statement said. “However, in its current form, this Bill is deeply flawed.”</p>



<p>The Minority argued that the legislation concentrates excessive appointing powers in the President, weakens independent oversight, and expands intrusive surveillance authority without adequate human rights safeguards.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ss_ZNTT1Hk?si=8fafFxhBXxe6zIc_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>On presidential powers, the caucus warned that the bill allows key security appointments without parliamentary vetting.</p>



<p>“It is unacceptable that they operate without legislative scrutiny,” the statement noted, adding that the offices involved control agencies with coercive powers and access to sensitive national data.</p>



<p>The Minority also criticised the proposed oversight structure, arguing that placing the National Security Council, chaired by the President, as the governing body of intelligence agencies amounts to self-regulation.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>



<p>“That amounts to self-oversight,” it stated.</p>



<p>On parliamentary scrutiny, the caucus raised concerns about provisions allowing security officers to withhold documents if disclosure is deemed prejudicial to national security.</p>



<p>“There is no requirement to provide reasons or even redacted versions,” the statement pointed out.</p>



<p>The Minority further objected to criminal sanctions of five to ten years for certain disclosures, arguing that the bill provides no explicit protection for whistleblowers.</p>



<p>On surveillance powers, it described the warrant regime as “deeply troubling,” warning that administrative authorisation for intercepting communications undermines the principle that only courts should approve invasions of privacy.</p>



<p>The caucus also expressed concern about the structure of Regional and District Security Councils, cautioning that their composition could risk politicisation, particularly during election periods.</p>



<p>“For these reasons, we cannot support the Bill in its present form,” the statement concluded.</p>



<p>The Minority called for independent oversight mechanisms, judicial-only warrant authorisation, stronger whistleblower protections, clearer human rights safeguards, and improved financial transparency.</p>



<p>“National security and civil liberty are not opposing goals. We can protect our nation without eroding the freedoms of our people. Parliament must get this balance right,” the statement said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At least 34 people have been killed in coordinated attacks by suspected Islamist militants on several villages in north-western Nigeria, officials have told the BBC.</p>



<p>The gunmen launched simultaneous assaults on multiple communities in a remote border district of Kebbi state on Tuesday, overwhelming local defences and forcing residents to flee their homes.</p>



<p>Survivors described the attackers as highly organised, saying they swept through villages firing indiscriminately at residents.</p>



<p>Officials have blamed the relatively new insurgent group Lakurawa, which is known to operate in the area. It was targeted by US air strikes in December, further north, in Sokoto state.</p>



<p>Security forces have now moved into the area to protect communities and assist survivors. Tracking operations are underway to cut off the militants&#8217; escape routes.</p>



<p>Authorities are yet to officially comment on the attacks, although images of shrouded corpses being prepared for burial have been circulating on social media.</p>



<p>The attack has sparked outrage among Nigerians online, with many calling on the government to end the violence that has become all too common in parts of the country.</p>



<p>Nigerian authorities officially declared Lakurawa a terrorist organisation last year and banned it across the country after reports emerged that its fighters were flogging people for listening to music.</p>



<p>Officials say Lakurawa is affiliated with jihadist factions in Mali and Niger. Its militants have for years settled in communities along the Nigeria-Niger border, marrying local women and recruiting young people into their ranks.</p>



<p>The group has previously carried out similar raids in Kebbi, using coordinated simultaneous attacks to swamp local defences.</p>



<p>The emergence of Lakurawa adds to Nigeria&#8217;s already complex security challenges, as the government continues to battle multiple armed groups, from Boko Haram Islamists in the north-east to heavily armed kidnapping gangs operating across the north-west and central states and separatists in the south-east.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) has commissioned a premium service centre at Bantama in Kumasi, a move aimed at bringing its services closer to residents and reducing the activities of middlemen, popularly known as “goro boys.”</p>



<p>The Chief Executive of the Authority, Julius Neequaye Kotey, speaking at the commissioning ceremony, said the establishment of the new facility forms part of efforts to improve service delivery and enhance transparency in line with the government’s ‘Reset Agenda’.</p>

<p>“These new DVLA offices signify our commitment to bringing services closer to the people and minimising the activities of goro boys within our system. </p>



<p>&#8220;We will not fight them with police action, but by expanding our presence and making our services directly accessible to the public, their activities will naturally decline,” he stated.</p>



<p>Mr. Kotey explained that the Bantama office was established through a collaboration between the DVLA and Midcity Auto Service under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement.</p>

<p>“We acknowledge the immense support received from Midcity Auto Service and our private partners. Their contribution made it possible to complete this facility, which we are proud to open to the public today,” he added.</p>



<p>He emphasised that ensuring road safety remains a key priority of the Authority, noting that every driver must be properly trained, tested and certified, while all vehicles must be duly registered and approved before being allowed on the road.</p>



<p>According to him, the new Bantama office will provide a full range of DVLA services, including vehicle registration, transfer of ownership, issuance of new driver’s licences, licence upgrading, renewal of licences, replacement of expired or lost licences, and conversion of foreign licences.</p>

<p>He noted that the facility is equipped with modern technology integrated into the DVLA’s digital systems to ensure faster, efficient and more convenient service delivery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Bank of Ghana (BoG) is warning that pressures from dividend payments scheduled for February 2026 and March 2026 may pose downside risks to the Ghana cedi.</p>



<p>According to its January 2026 Monetary Policy Report, a fall in gold prices due to the strengthening of the global economy or a de-escalation of geopolitical tensions could also pose downside risks for the Ghana cedi.</p>



<p>In the domestic forex market, the local currency came under some marginal pressure in early 2026 after an impressive performance in 2025.</p>



<p>Demand pressures, largely from energy, commerce, and manufacturing, were partly offset by BoG foreign exchange intermediation, mining and remittance flows, and export proceeds from other corporates.</p>



<p>The Central Bank said in the near term, the cedi is expected to remain stable, supported by continued BoG forex intermediation and strong reserve buildup.</p>



<p>It pointed out that proposed government infrastructure bonds to be issued in 2026 could further support the cedi.</p>



<p>“Furthermore, the final tranche of the IMF loan, flows from other external partners, and continued fiscal discipline will support the currency. Additionally, the dollar&#8217;s weakness, stemming from the Fed’s dovish outlook, as well as concerns about the Fed’s independence, will support the cedi”, it concluded.</p>



<p>In 2005, the cedi appreciated by 40.67%, 30.89% and 23.97% against the dollar, pound, and euro, respectively, on a year-to-date basis in the interbank market.</p>



<p>This is against a depreciation of 19.18%, 17.76% and 13.72% against the dollar, pound, and euro, respectively during the same period in 2024.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minister for Government Communications,&nbsp;Felix Kwakye Ofosu, has rejected claims that the absence of a substantive Defence Minister has created a vacuum within Ghana’s security architecture.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on<strong> Joy FM&#8217;s Top Story</strong> on Thursday, February 19, he explained that ministers do not implement personal policies but rather execute policies approved by the government and led by President John Dramani Mahama.</p>



<p>He further clarified that there is currently a minister responsible for defence who is capable of carrying out all required duties of the office.</p>



<p>“That another minister is acting as <a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/burkina-faso-attack-nitiwul-urges-government-to-appoint-defence-minister/">Defence Minister</a> does not in any way prevent him from implementing those policies. There is no lacuna,” the official stressed.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02eKkuBulmE?si=dFaRqbp5BoAvtE2x" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>According to Mr Kwakye Ofosu, President Mahama has already indicated that he will appoint a substantive Defence Minister at an appropriate time. </p>



<p>“The President has not indicated any difficulty whatsoever. He believes it ought to be done at the right time, and when that decision is made, it will be communicated,” he stated.</p>



<p>Addressing concerns over recent security developments, including the terrorist attack in Burkina Faso, the government insisted that all necessary steps have been taken to respond appropriately.</p>



<p>The government maintains that national security operations remain intact and coordinated, dismissing suggestions that the absence of a substantive minister has weakened Ghana’s defence posture.</p>

<p>The Minister for Government Communications, Felix Kwakye Ofosu, has assured Ghanaians that President John Dramani Mahama will appoint a substantive Defence Minister at the “appropriate time&#8221;.</p>



<p> Speaking in an interview on <strong>Joy FM&#8217;s Top Story</strong>, he dismissed concerns that the delay in appointing a substantive minister has created a vacuum within the country’s security architecture.</p>



<p>Responding to criticism from sections of the opposition and security analysts, he noted that there is currently no governance gap at the Ministry of Defence. </p>

<p>The government also rejected suggestions that the President is facing difficulty in identifying a successor, insisting that no such indication has been given.</p>



<p>“The President has not indicated any difficulty whatsoever in naming a substantive minister. He believes it ought to be done at the right time and within a given timeframe. When that decision is made, it will be communicated,” he explained.</p>



<p>He added that the acting minister is fully empowered to execute all duties of the office in line with policies approved by Cabinet and led by the President.</p>

<p>“We’re in the month of love and being asked to show kindness, and as you know, kindness is like a garden of flowers where love endures forever. So in this month of love, I’m here to show my love, and I call on every Ghanaian to come here to show their love. You may not have to be here physically, but you can use the digital channels or mobile money across all networks to show your love,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>“I would also like to call on my big brother, Simon Madjie, the CEO of the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre, to come to Mahama Cares and show love.”</p>



<p>The fund was established in 2025 as part of the government’s health policy interventions aimed at improving healthcare access and providing support to vulnerable groups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ministry of Education has issued a strong warning that assault on teachers will attract severe legal consequences, following a series of violent incidents recorded in schools across the country.</p>



<p>In a press statement signed by Deputy Minister for Education, Dr. Clement Abas Apaak, the Ministry expressed grave concern over cases involving attacks on teachers by students and other related acts of violence.</p>



<p>“The Ministry takes strong exception to these developments and is resolved to nip this in the bud,” the statement said. </p>



<p>It stressed that any individual — including students — who assaults a teacher in the lawful performance of their duties will face punishment in accordance with the laws of Ghana.</p>



<p>The Ministry highlighted several recent incidents that have resulted in arrests and prosecutions.</p>



<p>At Kade Senior High Technical School (Kade SHTS), perpetrators involved in the assault of a tutor were arrested and arraigned before the Kade District Court. The accused persons pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy and assault and have since been convicted and fined.</p>



<p>In another case at West Africa Senior High School, two students and an accomplice have been arraigned before an Adenta Circuit Court in connection with the assault of a teacher. The accused persons have been remanded into police custody for six weeks pending further court proceedings.</p>



<p>The Ministry also condemned misconduct recorded during the Super Zonal Sports Competition in the Eastern Region, which reportedly involved a stabbing and an alleged sexual assault. The suspects in that case have been arrested and are assisting police with investigations, while the victims are receiving medical and psychosocial support.</p>

<p>The statement referenced remarks by President John Dramani Mahama at the 54th Delegates Conference of the Ghana National Association of Teachers (GNAT), where he reiterated that no attack on teachers would be tolerated under any circumstances. </p>



<p>The President reaffirmed the government’s commitment to protecting educators and ensuring justice for victims.</p>



<p>The Ministry aligned itself with the President’s position and pledged to continue working closely with law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to ensure accountability and prevent future incidents.</p>

<p><strong>Resource mobilisation and the &#8216;Ready to Serve&#8217; mandate</strong></p>



<p id="p-rc_d0676a3e109fb5e9-47">In a strategic show of force, the Council used the Accra meeting to pledge its full weight behind the Bawumia campaign. Beyond mere endorsements, the Patrons committed to their core mandate: mobilising critical resources necessary for a high-octane, effective electioneering campaign.</p>



<p id="p-rc_d0676a3e109fb5e9-48">Ms Akosua Frema Osei Opare, the immediate past Chief of Staff and Chairperson of the Council, made it clear that the group’s elite membership is ready for deployment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Former Deputy Defence Minister Kofi Amankwa-Manu has warned that Ghana risks compromising critical security decision-making due to the continued absence of a substantive Defence Minister.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on <strong>Joy FM&#8217;s Top Story</strong> on Thursday, Mr. Amankwa-Manu argued that certain high-level decisions within the security architecture can only be taken by a fully appointed minister and not the Chief of Defence Staff or the Deputy Minister.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you have a substantive minister, it becomes easier for him to deal with the Ministry of Defence from the other front. There are certain cooperation agreements with other nations pertaining to security, also with the army, that you need a substantive minister to really deal with. And so not to have a substantive minister, for me, it&#8217;s a problem because that ministry is very sensitive and very strategic,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>According to him, without a substantive minister, key matters affecting the military may not receive the necessary advocacy and coordination at the Council.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02eKkuBulmE?si=qYlsLiSYXPYn3hvt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“The Defence Minister sits as a member of the Security Council. There are issues about the Ghana Armed Forces that a substantive minister will have to carry to the Council. If you don’t have that, it becomes a problem,” he said.</p>



<p>Referencing recent security concerns, including attacks on Ghanaians in Burkina Faso, the former Deputy Minister noted that international defence cooperation requires ministerial-level engagement.</p>



<p>Mr. Amankwa-Manu maintained that prolonged delays in appointing a substantive minister could weaken coordination, diplomacy, and rapid response mechanisms.</p>



<p>While acknowledging the efforts of existing officials within the ministry, he insisted that full ministerial authority is indispensable in matters of national security.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana) has highlighted a notable improvement in living conditions for many Ghanaians during the first year of the President John Dramani Mahama administration, attributing the trend to macroeconomic stability, currency appreciation, and falling fuel prices.</p>



<p>In its one-year assessment of the Mahama government, CDD noted that while lower inflation technically indicates that prices are rising more slowly, Ghanaians have experienced real price reductions across key sectors, signalling a tangible relief in the cost of living.</p>



<p>Fuel prices at the pump fell by approximately 4% to 8% between December 2025 and January 2026. This drop translated into a 15% reduction in commercial transport fares, directly easing daily commuting costs and the transportation of goods, the CDD report explained.</p>



<p>Food inflation saw a dramatic decline, falling from 28.3% in January 2025 to 4.9% by December 2025, while the cost of imported essentials, including medicines and raw materials, stabilised thanks to the appreciation of the Cedi.</p>



<p>CDD emphasised that while these developments have improved disposable incomes, particularly in major cities such as Accra and Kumasi, regional disparities remain. </p>



<p>Northern areas, for instance, have experienced slower price reductions due to logistical bottlenecks, including poor transport and communication infrastructure.</p>



<p>The assessment highlighted the administration’s ambitious fiscal consolidation efforts. By cutting wasteful spending and terminating underperforming programmes, the government reduced the national deficit from 7.9% to 3.1%, even achieving a temporary surplus by mid-2025.</p>



<p>CDD noted that this fiscal discipline allowed the government to provide direct relief to citizens and entrepreneurs through the abolition of “nuisance” taxes such as the E-Levy, Betting Tax, and Emission Tax, while raising the VAT threshold to protect small businesses.</p>



<p>“The state has managed to stabilise the economy without imposing additional tax burdens on the average Ghanaian,” the report stated.</p>



<p>Despite these achievements, CDD warned that revenue mobilisation remains a significant challenge. Tax revenue currently stands at 16.1% of GDP, below levels recorded in neighbouring countries such as Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire.</p>



<p>The report cautioned that insufficient revenue forces the government to borrow more, potentially raising public debt. </p>



<p>This concern is compounded by the launch of large-scale social and infrastructure projects, including the GH₵13.85 billion “Big Push” infrastructure plan and the “MahamaCares” health trust.</p>



<p>CDD emphasised that while these initiatives promise long-term benefits, they could strain the budget if additional revenue streams are not secured.</p>



<p>The think tank highlighted AI-driven tax compliance measures as a promising solution, which could enhance revenue collection and compensate for the loss of funds from abolished “nuisance” taxes such as the E-Levy.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Forum for Accountability and Development of Sefwi, Simon Asafo Adjei, has accused both the government and the opposition of shifting blame over the recent reduction in cocoa prices, insisting that the issue is a social and economic concern rather than a political one.</p>



<p>Speaking on&nbsp;<strong>Asempa FM’s&nbsp;<em>Ekosii Sen</em>&nbsp;show</strong>, Mr. Asafo Adjei said cocoa farmers in the Western North Region are demanding a reversal of the new pricing, which saw the price per bag drop from GH¢3,625 to GH¢2,587.</p>



<p>“The government and opposition are trying to shift blame in terms of cocoa pricing. The issue is not about politics. It’s a social contract between the government and us,” he stated.</p>



<p>He argued that farmers have consistently made sacrifices over the years and questioned why they should bear the brunt of global price reductions.</p>



<p>He also raised concerns about what he described as comparatively low producer prices and disparities in cost-cutting measures within the cocoa sector.</p>



<p>According to Mr. Asafo Adjei, the protest staged by farmers is not “petty politicking” but a legitimate call for the government to withdraw the new cocoa pricing and protect farmers’ livelihoods.</p>



<p>“As citizens who have sacrificed for decades, what do we truly gain from the state? This protest is not trivial politicking; the government must listen to our demands. We call on the government to withdraw the new cocoa pricing. It is evident that the existing social contract benefits the government, but if they truly wish to support farmers, they need to be consistent and fair in their commitments,” he said.</p>



<p>Cocoa farmers in the Western North Region staged the demonstration to press home their demands, urging government to act swiftly and ensure fair treatment for the farming community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Director of the Presidential Initiative in Agriculture and Agri-Business at the Office of the President, Peter Boamah Otokunor, has said the government has significantly transformed the agricultural sector within one year.</p>



<p>Speaking on&nbsp;<strong>Asempa FM’s Ekosii Sen show,</strong>&nbsp;Mr. Otokunor stated that food supplies are currently stable and prices have largely been controlled due to targeted investments in farming.</p>



<p>“In just one year, we have managed to transform the agricultural sector. Food supplies are now available, but since food crops are seasonal, it is essential to implement measures to avoid shortages. </p>



<p>&#8220;Currently, food prices are stable, and all the food in the markets was harvested in 2025. When investment is directed toward farming, the results become evident. The government’s performance will determine whether production will increase or decline,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr. Otokunor explained that one of the longstanding challenges in the sector has been the affordability and quality of farm inputs, many of which are imported.</p>



<p>However, he argued that the stabilisation of the cedi has reduced input costs and, by extension, the overall cost of production.</p>



<p>According to him, the improvements being witnessed are a direct result of deliberate government investment and effective agricultural policies.</p>



<p>“One major challenge we face is the affordability and quality of agricultural inputs. Any government that understands agribusiness can effectively manage the foreign exchange market, as most of our input supplies are imported. We have also worked to stabilise the currency, which has reduced the cost of inputs, leading to lower production costs.</p>



<p>“The positive outcomes we are witnessing are a direct result of government investment in the agricultural sector. Effective agricultural policy is crucial, and the results are becoming apparent quickly,” he stated.</p>

<p>Deputy Finance Minister Thomas Nyarko Ampem has commended the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) for intercepting 12 articulated trucks suspected to be involved in transit diversion, describing the operation as a bold move to protect state revenue.</p>



<p>In a post on Thursday, Mr Ampem praised the enforcement team for their swift action, noting that the interception sends a clear signal about the government’s determination to curb revenue leakages and clamp down on transit diversion.</p>



<p>“Investigation is ongoing to identify the six outstanding trucks,” he stated.</p>



<p>He further disclosed that he has directed the Commissioner-General of the GRA to conclude investigations within one week, adding that two Customs officers connected to the matter are being tracked.</p>

<p>“We take these things seriously because the impact on our revenue is serious,” he stressed.</p>



<p>On his part, the Commissioner-General of the GRA, Anthony Kwasi Sarpong, warned businesses and traders to comply strictly with Customs laws and procedures.</p>



<p>He cautioned that the Authority would not hesitate to enforce the law against offenders.</p>



<p>“We will apply the law of confiscation. The full arms of the law will be applied,” he said, adding that the GRA will take decisive action against.</p>



<p>The enforcement exercise, carried out between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. along the Dawhenya–Tema Road, was led by the Deputy Commissioner in charge of Operations. </p>



<p>The team included the Chief Revenue Officer, Preventive (Tema Collection), officers from Customs Headquarters and the Revenue Mobilisation Taskforce of National Security.</p>



<p>The 12 trucks form part of a consignment of 18 articulated vehicles that had been electronically gated out of the Customs system as transit goods. The cargo had been declared as goods in transit from Akanu and destined for Niger through Kulungugu.</p>

<p>However, the trucks were intercepted while moving without the mandatory Customs human escort, contrary to Ghana’s transit regulations.</p>



<p>The vehicles were loaded with 44,055 packages of edible cooking oil, tomato paste and spaghetti. Authorities estimate that the potential tax exposure linked to the consignment exceeds GH¢85 million.</p>



<p>Eleven of the trucks have since been secured at the GPHA Transit Terminal under strict Customs supervision, with support from the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority. One truck developed a mechanical fault during the operation, and arrangements are underway to transfer its cargo to another vehicle to ensure the goods remain secured.</p>



<p>Preliminary checks indicate that all 18 trucks were electronically cleared from the system, yet only 12 have been physically accounted for. Investigations are ongoing to trace the remaining six trucks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Centre for Democratic Development Ghana (CDD-Ghana) has cautioned that Ghana’s recent economic recovery under the John Dramani Mahama administration, though impressive on the surface, rests on what it describes as a “fragile foundation&#8221;.</p>



<p>In its one-year assessment released Thursday, February 19, the civil society group acknowledged that many Ghanaians are beginning to feel relief in the cost of living but warned that underlying fiscal and structural risks could threaten the gains.</p>



<p>In its strongest caution, CDD-Ghana said the apparent macroeconomic stability may not yet be durable.</p>



<p>“However, this stability is built on a fragile foundation,” the report stressed.</p>



<p>It explained that much of the cedi’s recent strength stemmed from gold reserve sales rather than deep structural transformation in manufacturing and exports.</p>



<p>The group also flagged labour market weaknesses, noting that most new jobs remain in the informal sector while about one-third of young Ghanaians are unemployed or out of school.</p>



<p>However, the report highlighted that falling inflation, the appreciation of the cedi and declining fuel prices have produced measurable price reductions in key sectors.</p>



<p>“For the first time in several years, many Ghanaians attest to experiencing a tangible fall in the cost of living,” the assessment noted.</p>



<p>Fuel prices dropped between four and eight per cent around December 2025–January 2026, triggering a 15 per cent reduction in commercial transport fares. Food inflation also plunged sharply from 28.3 per cent in January 2025 to 4.9 per cent by December 2025.</p>



<p>However, CDD-Ghana stressed that the benefits are uneven across the country, with some northern regions yet to experience the same price relief due to logistics bottlenecks and transport challenges.</p>



<p>The think tank credited the administration with achieving a significant fiscal reset in 2025.</p>



<p>Key gains highlighted include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Debt-to-GDP ratio falling from 61.8% to 45%</li>



<li>Treasury bill rates dropping from 30% to 11%</li>



<li>Budget deficit narrowing from 7.9% to 3.1%</li>



<li>Successful external debt restructuring boosting investor confidence</li>
</ul>



<p>Credit rating agencies Fitch Ratings and Moody&#8217;s subsequently upgraded Ghana to B- status, signalling improved global confidence.</p>



<p>CDD also pointed to strict commitment-based spending in 2025, which prevented the accumulation of new arrears.</p>



<p>Despite the progress, the group identified domestic revenue mobilisation as a major vulnerability.</p>



<p>Tax revenue currently stands at 16.1% of GDP, still below peers such as Senegal and Côte d&#8217;Ivoire, creating what the report calls a persistent “revenue lag&#8221;.</p>



<p>This shortfall, CDD warned, forces the government to rely on borrowing to finance spending, raising concerns about future debt accumulation.</p>



<p>The think tank specifically flagged the fiscal risks posed by large-scale programmes such as the GH₵13.85 billion Big Push infrastructure agenda and the MahamaCares health initiative.</p>



<p>“The general worry is that if the government doesn’t find a way to generate more revenues soon, these high-cost programs could eventually break the budget and undo the financial stability,” the report warned.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana described the creation of the Ghana Gold Board (GoldBod) in March 2025 as a landmark intervention that boosted exports, with small-scale miners shipping 103 tonnes valued at US$10.8 billion — surpassing large-scale mining output.</p>



<p>Yet the report raised environmental and governance concerns, warning the initiative could be unintentionally encouraging illegal mining.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, CDD warned that the government faces significant repayment pressures, about GH₵20 billion in 2026 and GH₵50.3 billion in 2027.</p>



<p>It said the administration must maintain strict fiscal discipline and accelerate growth to avoid slipping back into a debt trap.</p>



<p>“The test of the ‘Reset Agenda’ will not be in rhetoric but in concrete institutional reforms,” the report concluded.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana urged the government to move beyond short-term stabilisation and focus on value addition, job creation, and environmental protection to secure long-term economic resilience.</p>

<p>The government has reaffirmed its commitment to de-risk investment in Ghana’s tree crop sector as part of efforts to attract private capital, increase productivity, and strengthen value addition.</p>



<p>Deputy Minister for Finance, Thomas Nyarko Ampem, announced at the Tree Crop Summit held at the Accra International Conference Centre, where policymakers, agribusiness leaders, financial institutions and development partners gathered to deliberate on financing, sustainability and growth in the industry.</p>



<p>Addressing participants, Mr Ampem stressed that the government recognises the risks that have traditionally discouraged large-scale private investment in the sector and is taking deliberate steps to address them.</p>



<p>“Government is ready to de-risk investment in the tree crop sector to crowd in more private capital and boost production across the value chain,” he stated.</p>



<p>He explained that de-risking measures would include policy consistency, improved access to long-term financing, credit enhancement mechanisms, and support for outgrower schemes to protect both farmers and investors.</p>



<p>“We are committed to creating a predictable policy environment and strengthening institutions to ensure that investors have the confidence to commit long-term capital into the sector,” he added.</p>



<p>The Deputy Minister noted that Ghana’s tree crop industry, including cocoa, cashew, oil palm, shea, mango and rubber, holds significant potential for export diversification, job creation and rural industrialisation.</p>



<p>“The tree crop sector remains a critical pillar in our economic transformation agenda. If properly structured and financed, it can drive inclusive growth, create sustainable jobs, and improve livelihoods across rural communities,” Mr Ampem emphasised.</p>



<p>Stakeholders at the summit also discussed innovative financing models, climate-smart agriculture, and value addition strategies to reduce Ghana’s dependence on raw commodity exports.</p>



<p>Mr Ampem assured participants that the Ministry of Finance will continue collaborating with relevant agencies and the private sector to unlock funding opportunities and enhance risk-sharing frameworks.</p>



<p>“Our focus is to move beyond rhetoric to practical interventions that make the sector bankable and attractive to institutional investors,” he said.</p>



<p>The Tree Crop Summit forms part of broader efforts to reposition the sector as a viable and competitive investment destination capable of contributing significantly to Ghana’s economic resilience and long-term growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Member of Parliament for Damongo and Ranking Member on Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, Samuel Abu Jinapor, has disputed claims that Ghana’s newly commissioned Chancery in Addis Ababa is solely the achievement of the current administration.</p>



<p>In a<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1223802136543464&amp;set=a.537872435136441" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook post</a> titled <em>“Setting the Records Straight on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1223802136543464&amp;set=a.537872435136441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghana’s Addis Ababa Chancery</a>”</em>, Mr Jinapor described comments made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, at the commissioning ceremony as “erroneous” and an “egregious misrepresentation of facts”.</p>



<p>The new Chancery, located in Addis Ababa, was recently commissioned amid public commendation of the government’s efforts to strengthen Ghana’s diplomatic presence in Ethiopia.</p>



<p>However, Mr Jinapor insisted that construction of the project began under the administration of former President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.</p>



<p>According to him, the sod-cutting ceremony was performed by President Akufo-Addo on 10th February, 2020 on the sidelines of the African Union Summit.</p>



<p>The event, he said, was witnessed by then Ethiopian President Sahle-Work Zewde and other senior officials from both Ghana and Ethiopia.</p>



<p>Mr Jinapor, who stated that he was present at the ceremony, recalled that President Akufo-Addo had at the time lamented Ghana’s failure to own a chancery building in Addis Ababa, given the longstanding relations between the two countries dating back to the era of Kwame Nkrumah and Haile Selassie.</p>



<p>He rejected suggestions that the project had a 10-year history from 2016, describing such claims as misleading.</p>



<p>Construction, he maintained, commenced in February 2020, immediately after the sod-cutting and had reached about 90 per cent completion by October 2024.</p>



<p>Mr Jinapor further indicated that the only delay in the project’s completion was related to the final payment of the contract sum during the 2024 general elections period.</p>



<p>He argued that if there had been any interruption in progress beyond that point, it could not be attributed to the previous administration.</p>



<p>“This is a national project commenced by the previous Government and completed by the current Government,” he stated, adding that acknowledging continuity in governance should not be viewed as partisan.</p>



<p>He described it as disingenuous to characterise the chancery as a “Mahama project” when, according to him, the current administration only completed the remaining 10 per cent of the work.</p>



<p>Mr Jinapor urged the Foreign Affairs Minister, as the country’s chief diplomat, to acknowledge what he termed “unimpeachable facts” surrounding the project’s origins and execution.</p>
