										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Government has released GH¢855 million to settle arrears owed to cocoa farmers after a prolonged payment crisis that left many producers unpaid for months, despite delivering their produce to licensed buying companies.</p>



<p>The payment is part of an emergency intervention to stabilise the cocoa sector and restore confidence among farmers and buying companies. </p>



<p>In the wake of the crisis, the government has also announced a broad package of reforms aimed at restructuring the industry and putting the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) on a more sustainable financial footing. </p>



<p>These reforms include a controversial reduction of more than GH¢1,000 in the producer price per bag, a move that has sparked debate across the sector.</p>



<p>Speaking to journalists in Parliament of Ghana, Chairman of the Finance Committee, Isaac Adongo, defended the measures, describing them as difficult but necessary steps to rescue a sector he said has been under severe financial strain for years.</p>



<p>“The bottom line of all that has happened is that some amounts were owed to cocoa farmers, and the government took a decision to repay those monies so that the cocoa buying companies can settle the outstanding obligations,” he said.</p>



<p>“I’m happy to report that this morning, the government has released 855 million cedis for that purpose. But we have also decided to introduce a number of reforms that are long overdue. </p>



<p>&#8220;The cocoa sector has been under enormous strain over the years, and we have been pretending to service cocoa farmers while destroying the very vehicle we use to support them.”</p>



<p>The Majority in Parliament also blamed the crisis on the previous New Patriotic Party (NPP) administration, rejecting claims that responsibility lies with the current government. According to Mr Adongo, COCOBOD entered 2025 heavily indebted and financially distressed.</p>



<p>“COCOBOD entered 2025 with about GH¢17.8 billion in loans, plus significant operational liabilities. When you add everything together, the exposure was over GH¢60 billion. That vehicle could not be sustainable and had to be addressed,” he said.<br>“You have 60 billion of somebody’s money—it’s not free money. You are not paying, and yet you are saying we should continue to go and borrow more.”</p>



<p>Government maintains that the release of funds to farmers, coupled with structural reforms in pricing, financing and operations, is intended to stabilise the sector, protect farmers in the long term, and rebuild COCOBOD into a financially viable institution capable of sustaining Ghana’s cocoa economy.</p>

<p>Former Defence Minister and Bimbilla Member of Parliament Dominic Nitiwul has called on the government to provide a full explanation regarding recent developments affecting Ghanaian nationals abroad, emphasising the urgent need for a fully empowered Defence Minister to oversee investigations.</p>



<p>Mr Nitiwul’s comments come in the wake of a recent terrorist attack in Burkina Faso that targeted Ghanaian tomato traders, raising concerns about the safety of Ghanaian nationals operating in volatile regions of West Africa.</p>



<p>Eight Ghanaians were killed, and several others were injured in the deadly attack.</p>



<p>Speaking to the press, Mr Nitiwul expressed concern over what he described as insufficient information from government authorities. </p>



<p>“I just think that the Ghanaian government must be explaining to us what happened, the circumstances. I think the government has not yet come out,” he said. “They’ve come out officially with some statement, but we want a detailed explanation, either by the foreign minister or by the defence minister.&#8221;</p>



<p>He further stressed the importance of having a defence minister in place to coordinate Ghana’s response in times of crisis.</p>

</ul>



<p>“And that’s why I kept on calling that the President should have appointed a Defence Minister, because by this time the Minister for Defence should have been on the flight to Burkina Faso with his team,” Mr Nitiwul said.</p>



<p>The former minister highlighted that a defence minister with a full mandate is critical not only for leading investigations but also for ensuring timely government action and coordination with security agencies abroad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman of Parliament’s Finance Committee, Isaac Adongo, has announced that the Ministry of Roads and Highways will take over road construction projects previously managed by the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), citing mismanagement and unsustainable financial commitments.</p>



<p>Addressing a press briefing on the cocoa sector and related infrastructure challenges, the Bolgatanga Central MP disclosed that COCOBOD entered 2025 with more than GH¢26.5 billion in outstanding road commitments. Of this amount, only GH¢4.4 billion has been certified, rationalised and transferred to the Roads Ministry for implementation.</p>



<p>He stressed that road construction falls outside COCOBOD’s core mandate, particularly at a time when the board is facing significant financial strain.</p>



<p>“It is time for us to wash our hands off cocoa roads and get the appropriate ministry — the Ministry of Roads and Highways — to take over the construction of roads,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Adongo further revealed that between 2017 and 2020, COCOBOD undertook road projects without board approval. He said contracts worth GH¢1.4 billion were awarded in 2017, GH¢14 billion in 2018–2019, and GH¢5.8 billion during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite no allocations being approved for such works.</p>



<p>“The end result is that we are now saddled with about GH¢26.6 billion in road commitments at COCOBOD. Certainly, this cannot continue,” he stated.</p>



<p>He also raised concerns about the management of loans from the African Development Bank. According to him, COCOBOD accessed a GH¢600 million facility, of which GH¢250 million was not released by the bank. He added that the remaining GH¢350 million, intended to boost cocoa production, failed to achieve its objective, as cocoa output declined.</p>



<p>Mr Adongo maintained that transferring the road projects to the Roads Ministry would rationalise spending and allow COCOBOD to concentrate on its core responsibility of improving cocoa production.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, Vincent Ekow Assafuah, has petitioned the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) to investigate what he describes as serious concerns of conflict of interest, abuse of office, and administrative malpractice at the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD)]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, Vincent Ekow Assafuah, has petitioned the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) to investigate what he describes as serious concerns of conflict of interest, abuse of office, and administrative malpractice at the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD)</p>



<p>A formal petition was submitted to the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) today, Thursday, February 19, calling for a full-scale investigation into the issues.</p>



<p>The petition, grounded in Article 218(a) of the 1992 Constitution and Section 7(1)(a) of the CHRAJ Act, 1993 (Act 456), raises concerns about the conduct of Mr. Ato Boateng, Acting Deputy Chief Executive in charge of Finance and Administration at COCOBOD.</p>



<p><strong>Alleged Prior Ties to Private Company</strong></p>



<p>According to the petitioner, publicly available records and professional profiles indicate that Mr. Boateng previously served as Chief Executive Officer of Atlas Commodities Limited in 2018. The company is engaged in cocoa-related commercial activities.</p>



<p>The petitioner argues that this prior executive and fiduciary relationship raises red flags, particularly given Mr. Boateng’s current strategic role at COCOBOD, where he is said to wield significant influence over financial approvals, administrative control, regulatory oversight and institutional decision-making affecting Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs) and other cocoa sector operators.</p>



<p><strong>Warehouse Operations Under Scrutiny</strong></p>



<p>A key issue highlighted in the petition concerns the operations of Atlas Commodities Limited within warehouses registered under the Produce Buying Company (PBC).</p>



<p>Under COCOBOD regulations, warehouses are required to be registered under and used exclusively by specific Licensed Buying Companies. Such facilities are not to be used for the storage, grading, sealing or processing of cocoa belonging to other companies.</p>



<p>The petition contends that Atlas Commodities’ operations within PBC-registered warehouses raise serious regulatory and governance concerns, especially in light of Mr. Boateng’s previous leadership role at the company and his current senior management position at COCOBOD.</p>



<p><strong>Constitutional and Legal Basis</strong></p>



<p>The petitioner cites Article 284 of the 1992 Constitution, which states that a public officer must not place himself in a position where his personal interest conflicts or is likely to conflict with the performance of his official duties.</p>



<p>The petition also references the Public Office Holders (Declaration of Assets and Disqualification) Act, 1998 (Act 550), which prohibits public officers from engaging in conduct that creates a conflict between private interests and official responsibilities.</p>



<p>Additionally, Section 7(1)(a) of the CHRAJ Act empowers the Commission to investigate alleged corruption, abuse of power, unfair treatment and administrative injustice involving public officers.</p>



<p><strong>Key Issues for Investigation</strong></p>



<p>The petitioner is urging CHRAJ to investigate:</p>



<p>-Whether Mr. Boateng’s prior executive role at Atlas Commodities constitutes a conflict of interest under Article 284 of the Constitution.</p>



<p>-Whether full disclosure of his past association with the company was made to COCOBOD and relevant state oversight bodies upon his appointment.</p>



<p>-Whether Atlas Commodities has received any preferential treatment, regulatory accommodation or operational advantage within COCOBOD-regulated systems.</p>



<p>-Whether the use of PBC-registered warehouses by the company violates COCOBOD regulations and whether any official facilitation enabled such operations.</p>



<p>-Whether the circumstances amount to abuse of office, regulatory capture or administrative malpractice.</p>



<p><strong>Reliefs Being Sought</strong></p>



<p>The petition is requesting CHRAJ to conduct a full, independent and transparent investigation into the allegations; determine whether any constitutional, statutory or administrative breaches have occurred; and recommend appropriate sanctions or institutional reforms where necessary.</p>



<p>It further calls for corrective administrative measures to safeguard the integrity of COCOBOD’s regulatory and operational systems.</p>



<p>Describing the cocoa industry as one of Ghana’s most strategic economic pillars, the petitioner stresses that the integrity and impartiality of COCOBOD’s governance structures are of paramount national importance.</p>



<p>The petition concludes that any situation that reasonably gives rise to conflict-of-interest concerns must be addressed decisively to preserve public trust, institutional credibility and regulatory fairness.</p>



<p>CHRAJ is yet to publicly comment on the petition.</p>

<p>The Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) has intercepted 12 articulated trucks in a major enforcement operation along the Dawhenya–Tema Road, in what officials describe as a serious breach of Ghana’s transit regime with significant revenue implications.</p>



<p>The operation, conducted between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m., was led by the Deputy Commissioner, Operations, with support from the Chief Revenue Officer, Preventive (Tema Collection), the Revenue Mobilisation Taskforce of National Security, and enforcement officers from both the Tema Collection and Customs Headquarters.</p>



<p>The 12 trucks are believed to be part of a consignment of 18 articulated trucks that had been electronically gated out of the Customs system as transit goods.</p>



<p>They were declared as goods in transit from Akanu, destined for Niger through Kulungugu. However, the trucks were intercepted while moving without the mandatory Customs human escort, a major breach of transit procedures.</p>



<p>The trucks were loaded with 44,055 packages of edible cooking oil, tomato paste and spaghetti. Authorities say the actual value of taxes involved is over GH¢85 million.</p>



<p>Eleven of the intercepted trucks have been moved to the GPHA Transit Terminal and are under strict Customs supervision, with logistical support from the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority.</p>

<p>One truck developed a mechanical fault during the operation, and its contents are being transferred to another vehicle to secure the goods.</p>



<p>Preliminary checks confirm that all 18 trucks were electronically gated out of the system, yet only 12 have been physically secured.</p>



<p>Investigations are ongoing to identify and track the six outstanding trucks.</p>



<p>Deputy Minister for Finance, Thomas Nyarko Ampem, congratulated the team for the bust and explained that explained that “Investigation is ongoing to identify the six outstanding trucks.”</p>



<p>He disclosed that he has directed the Commissioner-General to conclude investigations within one week.</p>



<p>“I’ve asked the Commissioner-General to conclude investigations in one week. We are tracking the two Customs officers who were involved,” he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Ampem stressed the seriousness of the matter, noting that the potential revenue loss is substantial.</p>



<p>“We take these things seriously because the impact on our revenue is serious,” he added.</p>



<p>On his part, the Commissioner-General of the Ghana Revenue Authority, Anthony Kwasi Sarpong, cautioned businesses and traders to comply fully with Customs laws.</p>



<p>He warned that authorities would not hesitate to apply the full rigours of the law against offenders.</p>



<p>“We will apply the law of confiscation. The full arms of the law will be applied,” he said, adding that the GRA would crack the whip on any business or individual found culpable of actions that deny the state much-needed revenue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Chamber of Oil Marketing Companies (COMAC) and the Chamber of Bulk Oil Distributors (CBOD) have condemned the alleged diversion of funds from the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Fund to the Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing Company (GCMC), describing the move as a “flagrant breach of statutory mandate” and a “dangerous sabotage of national energy policy.”</p>



<p>The LPG Fund, implemented by the National Petroleum Authority (NPA) on April 1, 2024, under Legislative Instruments LI 2262 (amended) and LI 2481, was established with three legally binding objectives:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>USD 44/MT Bottling Plant Margin</strong> – To finance the construction and operation of LPG bottling plants nationwide.</li>



<li><strong>USD 36/MT Cylinder Investment Margin</strong> – To fund the Cylinder Recirculation Model (CRM) for safe and efficient LPG distribution.</li>
</ol>



<p>The press release emphasised that the fund’s purposes are non-negotiable and were never intended as discretionary capital for ad hoc allocations. </p>



<p>Redirecting resources to GCMC, according to COMAC and CBOD, represents not administrative flexibility but a direct breach of law that undermines the LPG safety and infrastructure framework.</p>



<p>The chambers argued that diverting the fund away from bottling plant development, CRM rollout, and the withdrawal of unsafe cylinders endangers lives. </p>



<p>“Government is actively choosing GCMC’s financial convenience over the holistic mission to increase LPG accessibility, remove lethal cylinders from circulation, and ensure safe replacement,” the statement read.</p>



<div data-wp-interactive="core/file" class="wp-block-file"><object data-wp-bind--hidden="!state.hasPdfPreview" hidden class="wp-block-file__embed" data="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PRESS-RELEASE-1.pdf" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%;height:600px" aria-label="Embed of PRESS RELEASE (1)."></object><a id="wp-block-file--media-34221074-479f-4dc5-a676-1c9b3d3ddb69" href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PRESS-RELEASE-1.pdf">PRESS RELEASE (1)</a><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PRESS-RELEASE-1.pdf" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" download aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-34221074-479f-4dc5-a676-1c9b3d3ddb69">Download</a></div>



<p>Beyond the immediate energy sector, the alleged diversion carries wider economic consequences:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Destruction of private investment</strong> – Operators who invested billions based on statutory assurances face potential collapse.</li>



<li><strong>Job losses</strong> – Thousands of livelihoods along the LPG value chain are threatened.</li>



<li><strong>Consumer exploitation</strong> – Households may bear the burden through higher prices, reduced supply, and continued safety risks.</li>



<li><strong>Investor flight</strong> – Both domestic and foreign investors may withdraw from a jurisdiction where statutory guarantees are not respected.</li>
</ul>



<p>The chambers warned that “every diverted cedi erodes competitiveness, freezes critical investment, and transfers wealth from productive enterprise to governmental discretion,” undermining public confidence in state institutions.</p>



<p>COMAC and CBOD outlined clear, non-negotiable corrective measures:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cease all disbursements</strong> to GCMC from the LPG Fund immediately.</li>



<li><strong>Reverse any allocations</strong> already made and restore funds to their lawful purpose.</li>



<li><strong>Reaffirm statutory mandate</strong> – Ensure the fund finances only bottling plants, CRM rollout, and unsafe cylinder withdrawal.</li>



<li><strong>Guarantee transparency</strong> – Implement quarterly public reporting on all fund utilisation with independent audit verification.</li>
</ol>



<p>“These are not industry requests. These are legal and moral imperatives,” the statement stressed.</p>



<p>The chambers a pointed message to authorities: the government must now decide whether to uphold the rule of law, protect its citizens, and maintain energy sector credibility, or to condone misallocation and bureaucratic convenience at the expense of safety and public trust.</p>



<p>COMAC and CBOD pledged to pursue all legitimate avenues—policy, legal, and public—to defend the LPG Fund’s rightful utilisation. </p>



<p>“We will not permit this fund to become a discretionary slush account. We will not remain passive while statutory protections are shredded. We will not accept anything less than full accountability, decisive leadership, and restoration of fund integrity,” the statement concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman of the Finance Committee of Parliament, Isaac Adongo, has disclosed that the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) began 2025 burdened with approximately GH¢17.8 billion in loans and additional operational liabilities, warning that the institution was facing severe financial distress.</p>



<p>Addressing a press briefing on the current cocoa sector crisis, the Bolgatanga Central MP said the scale of COCOBOD’s debt exposure had become unsustainable and required urgent intervention.</p>



<p>“COCOBOD entered 2025 with roughly GH¢17.8 billion in loans plus operational liabilities. So loans alone were about GH¢17.8 billion by the beginning of 2025.</p>



<p>“If you add this to other obligations, you will soon come to realise that at this point, COCOBOD was bleeding with an exposure of about GH¢60 billion,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Adongo argued that the situation made continued borrowing imprudent, stressing that the cocoa sector could not remain viable under such heavy debt.</p>



<p>“Certainly, that vehicle could not be sustainable and needed to be addressed,” he noted.</p>



<p>To illustrate his point, the MP used a metaphor, questioning the logic of accumulating more debt without fixing underlying inefficiencies.</p>



<p>“If you have a basket in which you put water to drink and the bucket is leaking, do you fix the leak before you put water inside, or do you continue to put the water inside hoping that some will be left for you to drink?” he asked.</p>



<p>Adongo criticised those he said were advising government to take on additional borrowing despite the existing liabilities, describing such arguments as &#8220;illogical&#8221;.</p>



<p>“You have GH¢60 billion of somebody’s money. It’s not free money. You are not paying, and you are saying that we should continue even to go and borrow more,” he said.</p>



<p>He maintained that the cocoa sector requires a reset, insisting that government must confront the financial realities rather than deepen COCOBOD’s debt burden.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Police in South Africa have detained the youngest son of Zimbabwe&#8217;s late former President Robert Mugabe after a reported shooting at a property in an upmarket suburb in Johannesburg.</p>



<p>Bellarmine Mugabe, thought to be in his late 20s, was taken into custody following allegations that a 23-year-old man, believed to be a gardener, was shot.</p>



<p>Police are currently at the house in Hyde Park, where Mugabe was staying, and are searching for a firearm in what they are describing as a case of attempted murder.</p>



<p>Bellarmine Mugabe is the youngest son of Robert and his second wife Grace Mugabe. Robert Mugabe, who died in 2019, led Zimbabwe for 37 years before being forced out of power at the age of 93 in 2017.</p>



<p>Two people have been detained for questioning as the South African police determine the circumstances of the shooting, police spokesperson Col Dimakatso Nevhuhulwi told the BBC.</p>



<p>Police are not yet officially naming Bellarmine Mugabe as one of those being held, but reporters at the scene saw him in handcuffs and he has been widely named by local media.</p>



<p>The victim is in hospital and in a critical condition, the spokesperson added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The government has announced plans to rename the National Investigations Bureau (NIB) as the Bureau of National Intelligence (BNI) as part of proposed reforms contained in the Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The government has announced plans to rename the National Investigations Bureau (NIB) as the Bureau of National Intelligence (BNI) as part of proposed reforms contained in the Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025.</p>



<p>The Interior Minister, Mohammed Mubarak Muntaka, told Parliament on Thursday, 19 January, that the change is intended to eliminate persistent confusion surrounding the NIB acronym, which is frequently mistaken for the National Investment Bank.</p>



<p>Addressing Members of Parliament on the floor of the House, the Minister argued that the overlap undermines clarity within the country’s security framework and runs counter to global practice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Everywhere in the world, you make sure that the acronyms for the security agencies do not match anything else, and in fact, it is supported by law to make sure that nobody can name anything after an acronym of any of the security agencies,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, we have a situation where, when you say NIB, people are wondering whether you&#8217;re talking about the bank or you&#8217;re talking about the security agency. So Mister Speaker, one of the significant things that we are trying to do is to reintroduce the name BNI at this time. Even though the BNI of yesterday was the Bureau of National Investigation, this BNI will remain the Bureau of National Intelligence.&#8221;</p>



<p>The proposed rebranding forms part of broader institutional adjustments aimed at restructuring Ghana’s security architecture. Beyond the name change, the bill also seeks to abolish the specific portfolio of the Minister for National Security.</p>



<p>Under the new arrangement, the President would be empowered to designate a Minister to exercise oversight over the National Security Coordinator, rather than maintaining a standalone ministry.</p>



<p>Explaining the rationale, Mr Muntaka said the reforms are designed to prevent operational friction and role duplication within the security establishment.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;A detailed ministerial role and the function of the national security coordinator, because he&#8217;s supposed to coordinate all the activities within the space. And if you assign or leave a ministry called the Ministry of National Security, which is likely supposed to play an oversight role, and if you are not careful, they begin to conflate, and they begin to have misunderstandings, and that affects the security architecture that we have in the country.</p>



<p>&#8220;So one of the things that we are trying to do is to keep this position as more or less that of the President, and then he gets one of his ministers to play that oversight without the necessarily fine, detailed designation of a minister for national security, so that as much as possible you try to avoid the conflict between the minister and the National Security coordinator&#8221;.</p>



<p>However, the Minority Leader, Alexander Afenyo-Markin, has mounted strong opposition to the Bill, cautioning that it risks concentrating excessive authority in the hands of the National Security Coordinator.</p>



<p>He questioned the necessity of the reforms, arguing that the memorandum accompanying the Bill fails to demonstrate shortcomings in the existing legal framework.</p>



<p>He said, &#8220;The memorandum before us does not provide any empirical evidence to suggest that ACT 1030 has failed. It appears that this bill is more founded on partisan political interest than a national security interest for good governance.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is being proposed? So much power is being given to the coordinator; it is not clear how his powers are going to be fettered, Mr Speaker. My submission is that if you give such powers to the coordinator, and you do not provide for a clear path of responsibility, accountability, and oversight, it becomes problematic to you yourself as a government, and when the rights of citizens are being abused, the man will come and tell you that in the name of national security. There will be the need for the Minister to sit with us as a house, do further winnowing, and incorporate the major concerns raised by the minority on this floor.&#8221;</p>



<p>The debate signals the likelihood of intense scrutiny as Parliament considers the Bill, with questions centering on accountability, oversight, and the balance of power within the national security framework.</p>

<p>GTEC stated that the college does not hold accreditation from the Nursing and Midwifery Council and had ignored a previous directive issued in June 2024, which prohibited the admission of new students.</p>



<p>The college, reportedly enrolling over 800 students, has been operating without proper registration, raising serious concerns about programme management and the quality of education being offered.</p>



<p>According to Accra-based Citi News, GTEC officials visited the campus on Thursday, February 19, and after an inspection lasting about an hour, announced the closure.</p>



<p>The Council emphasized that the measure was necessary to protect students and enforce national education standards.</p>



<p>Plans are being made to transfer affected students to accredited institutions, with special arrangements expected for final-year students to complete their programmes.</p>



<p>The closure left many students distraught, with some reportedly in tears on campus. Several expressed frustration, noting that they had recently paid tuition fees only to face an abrupt disruption to their studies.</p>



<p>During the enforcement visit, the Criminal Investigation Department accompanied GTEC officials, taking into custody the wife of the school’s owner and certain members of the college’s management team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A bill to allow persons with dual citizenship to hold public office, laid in parliament for consideration, has reopened a debate that strikes at the very heart of sovereignty, loyalty, and institutional maturity. This conversation must be had, but it must be had wisely.</p>



<p>Ghana is not hostile to dual citizenship. Far from it. Dual nationality has long been part of our national fabric, and it has brought immense value. Ghanaians living abroad and those who hold additional passports have returned with global exposure, technical expertise, investment capital, and administrative competence to support national development across sectors  from finance and health to diplomacy, technology, and public administration</p>



<p> But, of all the countries in the world, Ghana is part of the 49% that allows dual citizenship. With that said, some of these countries have limits to what a dual citizen can become in their country. Those without the limits have strict naturalisation laws and requirements. Ghana falls within those with limits on what one can become.</p>



<p>Our history proves this openness.</p>



<p>We witnessed this prominently under the administration of John Agyekum Kufuor and more recently during the tenure of Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo. No one has ever stopped capable Ghanaians with other nationalities from contributing to national development.</p>



<p>Some dual citizens served in high-level government roles as advisors and heads of state institutions. Ghana has never blocked its global citizens from contributing. I am confident there are dual citizenship holders currently serving in John Mahama’s administration.</p>



<p>And it should never stop. However, openness does not mean recklessness. In every serious state, there are lines drawn around sovereign-sensitive offices.</p>



<p><strong>What the Ghanaian Constitution Already Protects</strong></p>



<p>The framers of our democracy understood something timeless: allegiance must never be divided at the very top of state power. That is why the Constitution of the Republic of Ghana, 1992 provides explicit safeguards.</p>



<p>The Presidency — Article 62(1)(a) “A person shall not be qualified for election as President of Ghana unless he is a citizen of Ghana by birth.” Because the Commander-in-Chief must have only one unquestionable loyalty Ghana.<br>Parliament -Article 94(2)(a)</p>



<p>“A person shall not be qualified to be a Member of Parliament if he owes allegiance to a country other than Ghana.” Any allegiance elsewhere disqualifies you. Ghana’s constitutional architecture is not accidental. It is deliberate.</p>



<p>These two clauses alone reveal the spirit of Ghana’s constitutional thinking&nbsp;:<br>Leadership at the heart of state power demands exclusive national loyalty. And it is within this same spirit that other highly sensitive offices exist under constitutional authority, including:</p>



<p><strong>Chief of Defence Staff &amp; Service Chiefs</strong></p>



<p>Inspector General of Police<br>Ambassadors &amp; High Commissioners<br>Secretary to the Cabinet (executive authority under the Presidency)<br>While the Constitution appoints these roles through executive power, their nature is inseparable from national security, diplomacy, and sovereignty. No serious state treats them casually.</p>



<p><strong>Dual Citizenship Has Always Served Ghana With Limits</strong></p>



<p>Let us be clear and fair. Dual citizenship is not the enemy. It has strengthened Ghana. Our diaspora has powered investment, strengthened institutions, improved governance practices, and elevated Ghana’s global profile. In business, medicine, academia, development work, technology, and even government administration, dual citizens have played transformative roles.</p>



<p>Restrictions on a few sensitive offices do not erase this contribution. They simply protect the core of the state. And that protection is both reasonable and patriotic.</p>



<p><strong>Why Comparing Ghana to Europe Is Misleading</strong></p>



<p>Some argue that Europe and other advanced democracies allow dual citizens to hold high public office  so Ghana should follow. But this comparison ignores a fundamental truth: Europe’s political stability rests on centuries of strong institutions, deep-rooted accountability systems, independent justice structures, and mature anti-corruption safeguards. </p>



<p>Ghana is still building hers. This is not an insult to our democracy  it is honesty.</p>



<p>Until our institutions are strong enough to manage conflicts of interest swiftly, enforce accountability without fear or favour, and secure the state against sophisticated political and financial misconduct, divided allegiance at the highest levels of power is a risk we cannot afford.</p>



<p><strong>Accountability, Extradition, and National Security</strong></p>



<p>There is also the uncomfortable but necessary question of enforcement. What happens when a dual citizen occupying a sensitive office compromises Ghana’s national interest and escapes to their second country, especially one without an extradition agreement? How does Ghana compel justice? Even those with an extradition agreement, the host country can decline Ghana’s request.</p>



<p>Sovereignty without enforceable accountability becomes ceremonial. The higher the office, the greater the risk  and the greater the need for exclusive national loyalty.</p>



<p><strong>The Global Reality: Many Countries Draw the Same Lines</strong></p>



<p>Across the world, states quietly acknowledge that dual allegiance becomes dangerous at the highest levels of power. For example:</p>



<p>The United States restricts its presidency to citizens by birth and limits sensitive security clearances. Japan requires renunciation of other citizenships for naturalisation. The Netherlands generally withdraws citizenship when another is acquired. </p>



<p>Singapore and China do not recognise dual citizenship.</p>



<p>Several African states, including Rwanda and Kenya, allow dual nationality but restrict access to certain sensitive public offices. Even where dual citizenship exists, limitations almost always follow. Why? Because nations understand that loyalty cannot be split when sovereignty is at stake.</p>



<p>Citizenship, Conflict, and National Interest<br>Dual citizens swear allegiance to two sovereign states. In moments of diplomatic tension, military conflict, economic sanctions, or strategic negotiations where interests clash, no statute can regulate the human instinct of loyalty. History teaches that when national interests collide, divided allegiance becomes a vulnerability. This is precisely why sensitive offices across the world remain guarded.</p>



<p><strong>Public Office Is Service, Not Convenience</strong></p>



<p>Serving in Ghana’s highest offices is not an entitlement. It is a sacred trust. Anyone who seeks to lead Ghana at the pinnacle of state power must be willing to hold one allegiance to Ghana alone. If one cannot relinquish other nationalities for the honour of such service, that choice is valid, but leadership at that level must then belong to those whose loyalty is undivided. That is not discrimination. That is patriotism.</p>



<p>A Wise Balance for a Developing Democracy</p>



<p>This balance has served us well. To dismantle it prematurely in the name of modernity would be to trade caution for risk. Perhaps in the future, when institutions are exceptionally strong, corruption safeguards airtight, accountability swift, and national security systems fully resilient, this debate can be reopened. But today, wisdom must prevail over haste.</p>



<p>Dual citizenship has always been part of Ghana’s progress story, and it should remain so. But safeguarding the highest offices of the state is not backwardness. It is responsible governance. Restrictions on sensitive national positions are fair.</p>



<p>They are prudent and patriotic. A nation that fails to protect the core of its sovereignty eventually loses control of its destiny. Ghana must remain open  but never naïve. One country. One sovereignty. One undivided allegiance at the helm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Private legal practitioner Justice Abdulai has declared his support for the removal of the Electoral Commission (EC) Chairperson, Jean Mensa, and her deputies, describing such a move as necessary for Ghana’s democratic progress.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on Joy FM’s Midday News on Thursday, 19 February, he acknowledged holding a personal bias against the EC Chair, stating that he has not been impressed with her performance, particularly in the last two general elections.</p>



<p>“I have to be honest about my position on the EC Chair in particular — I am biased against her removal. Any petition legitimately intended for her removal, I’ll be in support of it,” he said.</p>



<p>He argued that the removal of the EC leadership would be a “good omen” for Ghana, stressing that the Commission’s work in recent years has left much to be desired.</p>



<p>“I needed her out because I’m not impressed with her work, particularly since the last two elections,” he added.</p>



<p>His comments follow the decision by Chief Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie to dismiss petitions seeking the removal of the EC Chair, her deputies, and the Special Prosecutor, on the grounds that the complaints failed to meet the prima facie threshold required under Article 146 of the Constitution.</p>



<p>However, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) has insisted that the Electoral Commission’s leadership must be removed.</p>



<p>While agreeing that the Chief Justice’s ruling must be respected, the lawyer raised concerns about the discretionary power vested in the Chief Justice in determining whether a prima facie case has been established.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DN_ZCmXbDIw?si=ixxc0E4sebSFlJR6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>He warned that such discretion could turn the removal process into a political tool, depending on how public office holders “appeal” to the relevant authorities.</p>



<p>“It becomes a serious political tool for the removal of these public office holders, depending on whether the person appeals appropriately to the President or the Chief Justice,” he cautioned.</p>



<p>He renewed calls for reforms to Article 146, advocating legislative measures to regulate the removal of Article 71 office holders, including senior judicial and electoral officials.</p>



<p>He also welcomed similar proposals by Minority MP Nana Agyei Baffour Awuah, who has called for a Constitutional Instrument (CI) to guide the process.</p>



<p>“I had already made that proposal,” he said. “It is in the right direction, and we have to have this done.”</p>

<p><br>The Chief Executive Officer of <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0">Chartman Herbal Center</a>, <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1">Dr Charity Twumasi Ankrah</a>, has advised women to prioritise personal care after childbirth, warning that neglecting hygiene and health could affect intimacy in marriage.</p>



<p>She made the remarks during a discussion on the Let’s Talk show on <strong>Joy Prime</strong>, where a married man’s loss of interest in sex with his wife due to vaginal odour sparked the conversation.</p>



<p>According to Dr Ankrah, many women tend to pay more attention to their children after birth and forget to care for themselves. She stressed the importance of self-development, saying, “Hygienically, mentally, spiritually, physically, healthwise, you have to work on yourself.”</p>



<p>She explained that vaginal odour could be caused by postpartum bleeding that is not cleaned properly, infections and hormonal changes.</p>



<p>Dr Ankrah also cautioned women against using certain products to tighten or clean the vagina. She said, “When you begin to drink these things and begin to insert these things, you automatically eliminate all these good bacteria that protect the vagina.”</p>



<p>She added that the vagina is designed to open and close naturally, and encouraged women to understand their bodies in order to detect any changes early. “Know your bodies, know your scent,” she advised.</p>



<p>Dr Ankrah further offered support to women dealing with such conditions, saying, “I would love to treat it.” She also recommended healthy eating, including fruits and vegetables, and drinking enough water to help balance hormones and improve overall health.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Civil and Local Government Staff Association of Ghana (CLOGSAG) has announced plans for an industrial action following what it described as government inaction on the implementation of a unique salary structure and improved conditions of service for civil and local government staff.</p>



<p>In a press statement released on Thursday, February 19, 2026, the National Executive Council (NEC) of CLOGSAG outlined the protracted history of negotiations on the issue, which began in 2019 and culminated in the signing of two separate Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WhatsApp-Video-2026-02-19-at-12.52.09-PM.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Despite repeated reminders to the Ministry of Labour, Jobs and Employment and the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission (FWSC), the NEC noted that the government has failed to respond or implement the agreed measures, which were to take effect from January 1, 2025.</p>



<div data-wp-interactive="core/file" class="wp-block-file"><object data-wp-bind--hidden="!state.hasPdfPreview" hidden class="wp-block-file__embed" data="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PRESS-STATEMENT-DELAY-IN-THE-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-UNIQUE-SALARY-STRUCTURE-19TH-FEB.-2026-2.pdf" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%;height:600px" aria-label="Embed of PRESS STATEMENT - DELAY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIQUE SALARY STRUCTURE 19TH FEB. 2026 (2)."></object><a id="wp-block-file--media-57afc29c-d81f-4dcd-a230-f4aa883fd87d" href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PRESS-STATEMENT-DELAY-IN-THE-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-UNIQUE-SALARY-STRUCTURE-19TH-FEB.-2026-2.pdf">PRESS STATEMENT &#8211; DELAY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIQUE SALARY STRUCTURE 19TH FEB. 2026 (2)</a><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/PRESS-STATEMENT-DELAY-IN-THE-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-UNIQUE-SALARY-STRUCTURE-19TH-FEB.-2026-2.pdf" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" download aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-57afc29c-d81f-4dcd-a230-f4aa883fd87d">Download</a></div>



<p>The NEC expressed concern that staff of the Civil Service and Local Government Service are being “taken for granted” as a result of the government’s failure to honour its commitments. </p>



<p>In response, the council has declared industrial action to press for the demands of its members.</p>



<p>CLOGSAG has further warned that, should the government continue to disregard the agreements, the association’s constituents will embark on a nationwide strike starting March 9, 2026. </p>



<p>&#8220;NEC decided further that should the government fail to honour its side of the bargain, the constituents of CLOGSAG would embark on a nationwide strike with effect from 9th March 2026,&#8221; the statement concluded.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the United Kingdom former royal, has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the United Kingdom former royal,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/2/19/live-ex-uk-prince-andrew-arrested-amid-epstein-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been arrested</a>&nbsp;on suspicion of misconduct in public office.</p>



<p>A statement from Thames Valley police was released Thursday that said, “As part of the investigation, we have today (19/2) arrested a man in his sixties from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office and are carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk.”</p>



<p>“The man remains in police custody at this time.”</p>



<p>King Charles II said after arrest that “the law must take its course” in the investigation of his brother.</p>



<p>Mountbatten-Windsor, the British former prince, was stripped of his title last year over his friendship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, amid ongoing furore over accusations against him of sexual assault, which he denies.</p>



<p>Police officers were investigating him for several allegations that emerged after US authorities released&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/30/us-department-of-justice-releases-three-million-new-epstein-documents" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 3 million pages</a>&nbsp;of documents relating ⁠to the disgraced financier.</p>



<p>Some of those files suggested that Mountbatten-Windsor had, in 2010, forwarded to Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited on ‌official trips as UK trade envoy. In one confidential memo, he sought Epstein’s views on investment opportunities in Afghanistan’s Helmand province.</p>



<p>“We will not be naming the arrested man, as per national guidance. Please also remember that this case is now active so care should be taken with any publication to avoid being in contempt of court,” the police statement added.</p>



<p>Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said: “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office.</p>



<p>“It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence. We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”</p>



<p>Mountbatten-Windsor should cooperate with the United States authorities in their investigation, the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said. “No one is above the law,” he added. Mountbatten-Windsor has consistently denied any wrongdoing.</p>



<p>“This is such an unprecedented action and move for a prince that was one time the queen’s favourite child, who held a number of high-profile roles within the British establishment, who gradually had this fall from grace because of his association with a convicted pedophile,” said Al Jazeera’s Milena Veselinovic, reporting from London. “This is yet another blow to the branding of the monarchy.”</p>



<p>Michael Walker, a political commentator and contributing editor at Novara Media, says the developments are “incredibly damaging” for the UK’s monarchy and establishment, more generally.</p>



<p>“There is an impression that even though Andrew has been pushed out of the royal family, it was always one step behind,” he told Al Jazeera.</p>



<p>“There is no impression that the royal family sort of learned about these things and was genuinely morally outraged so therefore pushed Andrew to the side,” he added.</p>



<p>“It always seems like they are a step behind, there’s a PR disaster and they say, ‘How do we distance ourselves from this man who is an embarrassment’ – as opposed to “How do we sort of bring about consequences for this man who has morally erred’.”</p>



<p>The arrest comes after the royal family last week&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/9/uk-king-charles-will-support-police-probe-into-ex-prince-andrew-epstein" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committed to cooperate</a>&nbsp;with the police on any investigation regarding Mountbatten-Windsor.</p>

<p>Ghanaian artiste manager, entertainment pundit, and graphic artist Lawrence Nana Asiamah Hanson, popularly known as Bullgod, has shared how former President Nana Addo Danquah Akufo-Addo spearheaded his arrest and had him placed in a prison cell.</p>



<p>According to him, speaking on <strong>Changes</strong> on <strong>Joy Prime</strong>, he addressed the Menzgold saga during a television interview, stating that the former president would not complete his term because of the pain caused to victims whose investments were locked up.</p>



<p>He said he was arrested immediately by a police convoy right after the interview and put behind bars, which he believes was done under Akufo-Addo’s instructions.</p>



<p>“I said he needed to pay the money before he finished his term if eno be so he no go finish his term; he go run away and boom they said I had threatened him. I went to one of the channels, I reach house and wanted to go buy some fufu. So, I was speaking to my PA and then I saw four wheel drives and boys are jumping out with bullet proofs with guns,” he told Roselyn Felli.</p>



<iframe width="1351" height="482" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XjlgSDnh2Ko" title="Bullgod Opens Up About His &#39;Adopt a Prison&#39; Initiative &amp; Time Managing Shatta Wale!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>‘I spent three days at the BNI Cells and was moved because they cannot prosecute me and handed me over to the police. When I was done with my interrogation with the police. They made sure I was put in the hardest cells you can ever find in Accra. Like where they put armed robbers, rapists, killers, etc. I was put in the SWAT cells for two days,” he added.</p>



<p>Bullgod continued by saying that the BNI cells were very large and that he was the only one there. As a result, he was afraid to sleep because he believed his detention was politically motivated and that anything could happen at night, so he stayed awake for three days.</p>



<p>He also revealed that the police are not responsible for feeding prisoners, so if no one brings you food, you remain hungry. He added that whenever food was brought in, he and the others shared it among themselves.</p>



<p>Fortunately for Bullgod, he said he was spared the prison cell leader’s routine because of his popularity.</p>

<p>His death has triggered an outpouring of tributes from across Ghana’s media, political, and religious communities, reflecting the wide influence he wielded during his decades of service.</p>



<p>Funeral arrangements are expected to be announced by the family in the coming days.</p>

<p>In today’s <strong><em>Roads of Peril </em></strong>feature, we highlight the negative effect of the poor nature of the Kwabenya-Berekuso-Kitase stretch on healthcare delivery and education.</p>



<p>On the Kwabenya-Berekuso-Kitase stretch, pupils make their way to and from school along a dusty, pothole-ridden road.</p>



<p>Covering their faces with handkerchiefs has become part of the daily routine as every passing vehicle leaves behind a haze of dust that blurs visibility.</p>



<p>Beyond the classroom, the impact is evident at the Berekuso Health Centre, where health workers report increasing respiratory diseases. More in today’s episode of “Roads of Peril” by Pearl Ofori.</p>

<p>The Narcotics Control Commission (NACOC) has intensified behavioural detection operations at Kotoka International Airport (KIA) as part of renewed efforts to curb narcotics trafficking through Ghana’s main international gateway.</p>



<p>The exercise, spearheaded by NACOC’s Canine (K9) Unit in collaboration with its Enforcement Unit stationed at the airport, focused on screening both inbound and outbound passengers exhibiting behavioural indicators commonly associated with drug trafficking.</p>

<p>Officers deployed trained sniffer dogs, advanced scanning equipment and profiling techniques to monitor passenger movement, while ensuring minimal disruption to airport operations, NACOC said in a statement.</p>



<p>Although the operation focused on selected airlines, individuals identified as persons of interest were subjected to further scrutiny regardless of their airline or flight, underscoring what officials described as a non-discriminatory, intelligence-led approach.</p>

<p>Strategic searches were conducted at key locations within the airport enclave, including Aviance Ghana, a major ground-handling facility.</p>



<p>According to NACOC, the targeted interventions form part of a broader security strategy aimed at sealing operational loopholes frequently exploited by traffickers.</p>

<p>Beyond enforcement, officers used the exercise to sensitise passengers and airport staff to substance abuse, the dangers associated with drug trafficking and the legal consequences of narcotics-related offences. </p>



<p>The increased visibility of the K9 Unit was also intended to serve as a deterrent and to reinforce public confidence in the Commission’s operations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Member of Parliament for Gomoa Central, <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0">Kwame Asare Obeng</a>, popularly known as A Plus, has announced plans to sponsor a private member’s bill in Parliament to punish women who engage in paternity fraud.</p>



<p>Speaking on Prime Time with <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1">George Quaye</a>, he said there should be “a legislation that prescribes punishment for people who engage in paternity fraud”.</p>



<p>According to A Plus, some women are aware they had multiple partners within a certain period. He stated that “women knows that between a certain period they were having something to do with one or two men”.</p>



<p>He backed his claim with an account of his experience at a health facility, saying “out of 10 women who come for DNA with their kids about four do not belong to the men”.</p>



<p>The Gomoa Central MP argued that punishment for paternity fraud should be severe, particularly where the woman is married. He said, “the punishment must be more if she’s married than a single woman”.</p>



<p>He stressed the emotional and financial burden on men who unknowingly raise children who are not biologically theirs. As an example, he cited situations where “a woman goes to court with her husband and three kids or four kids do not belong to the man”.</p>



<p>A Plus maintained that there is “no justification” for a woman to deceive a man about paternity, even if she had suffered abuse for being barren. He called for sanctions “if a DNA test is done and it is discovered that you the woman went to cheat or for whatever reason the child is not your husband’s and you hadn’t declared it early on”.</p>



<p>He further pointed to what he described as the severe consequences for men who discover such cases later in life, recounting an instance where “somebody committed suicide somewhere outside” after learning that the children he had raised were not biologically his.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ga Mantse Tackie Teiko Tsuru II is in a stable condition following a road accident in the early hours of Wednesday.</p>



<p>The incident occurred at about 2:00 am at Pai-Katanga in the Oti Region while the King was returning to Accra from Tamale.</p>



<p>Sources close to the palace said he had travelled to the Northern Region on a private visit at the invitation of the Yaa Naa.</p>



<p>The visit, described as cordial and significant, formed part of ongoing engagements between traditional authorities aimed at strengthening bonds of unity and mutual respect among Ghana’s revered institutions.</p>



<p>However, on his return journey to Accra, the Ga Mantse’s vehicle was involved in an accident. He escaped unhurt and is reported to be in stable condition.</p>



<p>Personnel of the Ghana Police Service were said to have responded swiftly when they were alerted to the scene.</p>



<p>Although the full circumstances surrounding the accident are yet to be detailed, the mood at the palace is said to be one of relief and thanksgiving, as the Ga Mantse remains in good spirits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghanaian artiste manager, entertainment pundit and graphic artist <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0">Lawrence Nana Asiamah Hanson</a>, popularly known as BullGod, has opened up about his experiences in police custody, revealing that the longest he has stayed in a prison cell was one month.</p>



<p>He made the disclosure on <em>Changes,</em> an afternoon show on <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1">JoyPrime</a>, on 18th February 2026.</p>



<p>‘I spent three days at the BNI Cells’ he shared. He explained that he was arrested over alleged threats against former President <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=2">Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo</a> after he said, “He needed to pay the money before he finishes his term, if eno be so he no go finish his term and he go run away”.</p>



<p>According to Bullgod, he was later moved from the <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=3">Bureau of National Investigations</a> cells because they could not prosecute him. He said he was handed over to the police after interrogation and locked up for two days in a SWAT cell, where he met suspected killers and kidnappers.</p>



<p>“The cells were scary” he said, “When you enter for the first time you will be hugged by something and that is, the stench and you go feel am” he shared. “And the washroom waters don’t run” he continued.</p>



<p>Bull also said the BNI cells were very large and he was the only one there. He added that he was afraid to sleep because he believed his arrest was politically motivated and anything could happen at night, so he stayed awake for three days.</p>



<p>He said he was later transferred to another cell for two days and did not shower or use the washroom. “The place is not convenient” he said.</p>



<p>He further narrated that on a Friday, he was expected to appear in court to seek bail. Around 5 o’clock, he said nature called and when he went to the washroom, he saw two men seated on the toilet bowl asleep. Another man, he said, leaned against a partition to sleep because the place was overcrowded. Close to 40 people were sharing the cell, with some staying there for two years, one month, six months and eight months.</p>



<p>He revealed, “The police is not responsible to feed the prisoners so when no one brings you food you stay hungry, so him along with others when they receive their food they share with everyone”.</p>



<p>Furthermore, he said, “When you get to a prison cell, you will be asked to follow a routine by the cell leader, luckily for me I didn’t follow the routine because we put our faces out there”.</p>



<p>“The longest I have stayed in a prison cell was month” Bull God revealed as he narrated how he was arrested in connection with the alleged murder of <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=4">Fennec Okyere</a>.</p>



<p>He later said, “I felt bad at that moment but now I don’t because it was meant to make me strong”.</p>



<p>His experiences, he noted, have inspired a new initiative dubbed “Adopt A Cell”. The project seeks to bring art into prison cells through graffiti, murals and other creative works. “We believe Art has healing powers to calm the nerves” he said.</p>



<p>“We have a police cell design befitting for people in the holding cells and it’s a nationwide project”.</p>



<p>Do you support Bull God with this initiative? Do you think he was meant to go through these experiences? Share your thoughts.</p>

<p>Former Vice President of Ghana and New Patriotic Party (NPP) flagbearer, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, has paid tribute to the late Dr Alhaji&nbsp;Abubakari&nbsp;Sidick&nbsp;Ahmed, former Station Manager of Radio Univers 105.7 FM, highlighting his personal connection and the enduring impact the media veteran had on his career.</p>



<p>Speaking on Thursday at Alhaji Abubakar’s residence following his passing, Dr Bawumia said the late broadcaster gave him his very first radio interview in Ghana — a moment he said he has never forgotten. “I had never spoken on any radio or TV station, never. But he gave me my very first interview in Ghana, and I’ve never forgotten that,” Dr Bawumia recalled during the condolences. </p>

<p>Alhaji Sadick Abubakar, also affectionately known simply as <em>Alhaji</em>, died on Monday, February 17, 2026, at the University of Ghana Medical Centre, where he had been receiving treatment in recent days. He was 63 years old. </p>



<p>Dr Bawumia described how their friendship continued over more than two decades, including moments such as when he was in Zimbabwe in 2011, and Abubakar reached out to him while seeking medical care in South Africa. “We have maintained a close friendship, and, sadly, he’s not with us today,” he added. </p>

<p>In his remarks, the former vice president drew on Islamic teachings to reflect on life’s impermanence and the importance of living with moral consciousness.</p>



<p>“The Quran tells us that death is a certainty, and it will reach all of us… we should live on this earth as if we are travellers or strangers,” Dr Bawumia said, urging people to consider how awareness of mortality can shape behaviour. </p>



<p>Dr Alhaji&nbsp;Abubakari&nbsp;Sidick&nbsp;Ahmed was recognised as a doyen of Ghanaian media, known for mentoring generations of broadcasters and for transforming Radio Univers into a respected training ground for journalists. </p>



<p>His tenure included leadership in major programming innovations and fostering strong ties between academic training and professional broadcasting. </p>



<p>Tributes have poured in from media professionals and academic institutions alike. </p>



<p>The Department of Communication Studies at the University of Ghana described him as a foundational figure who helped shape careers and strengthen ethical journalism in the country. </p>



<p>Alhaji Abubakar’s influence extended well beyond campus radio. </p>



<p>His protégés now hold positions in major media houses across Ghana and internationally, continuing the legacy he built over decades of service. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[South Korea's ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol has been jailed for life for masterminding an insurrection by trying to impose military rule.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>South Korea&#8217;s ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol has been jailed for life for masterminding an insurrection by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6277zz434zo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying to impose military rule</a>.</p>



<p>Yoon attempted to subvert the constitution by deploying military troops to seal off the National Assembly and ordering the arrest of politicians on 3 December 2024, a Seoul court ruled. His actions fundamentally damaged South Korea&#8217;s democracy and deserves a harsh punishment, presiding judge Ji Gwi-yeon told the court.</p>



<p>Prosecutors had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6vyqq5r0do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sought the death penalty</a>.</p>



<p>Though it was short-lived, Yoon&#8217;s martial law order left the nation<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yv4p95m6vo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;more polarised than ever</a>, and those deep divisions were on full display as the sentencing took place.</p>



<p>Huge crowds of Yoon&#8217;s supporters gathered outside the court hours before the hearing, holding banners reading &#8220;Yoon, again&#8221;. Many of them broke down in tears following the verdict.</p>



<p>Also present were anti-Yoon protesters, rallying for him to be sentenced to death.</p>



<p>Yoon himself showed no emotion as he learned of his fate. His lawyers alleged that the verdict was not backed by evidence and accused the judge of following a &#8220;pre-written script&#8221;.</p>



<p>If either side launches an appeal, the case will go up to the Supreme Court, which means it could be months before the verdict is finalised.</p>



<p>Yoon shocked his nation on 3 December 2024 by declaring martial law on live television.</p>



<p>He claimed it was to protect the country from &#8220;anti-state&#8221; forces that sympathised with North Korea, but it soon became clear he was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y7jxe88w3o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driven by domestic troubles</a>: the opposition which held a parliamentary majority left him a lame duck president, while his wife Kim Keon Hee was at the centre of various corruption allegations.</p>



<p>He rolled back the order within hours, after lawmakers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98lygwd837o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fought their way into the National Assembly</a>&nbsp;to overturn it.</p>



<p>What followed were months of political chaos,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz01mjv0v0go" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoon&#8217;s impeachment</a>, and a string of indictments against him and other top officials.</p>



<p>Former prime minister Han Duck-soo was handed a 23-year jail term last month for his part in the insurrection, while ex-defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who advised Yoon to impose martial law, was jailed for 30 years on Thursday.</p>



<p>Former interior minister Lee Sang-min, former intelligence commander Roh Sang-won, and ex-police chief Cho Ji-ho were among the other officials jailed for what judges have described as &#8220;an insurrection from the top&#8221;.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1522/live/b40afac0-0d71-11f1-b1f2-a50c2c5773ab.jpg.webp" alt="AFP via Getty Images A female Yoon supporter, who&#039;s holding a flat, and wearing a visor, sunglases and a winter coat, cries out as the verdict is delivered" title="South Korea&#039;s ex-president jailed for life over martial law attempt"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Many of Yoon&#8217;s supporters broke down in tears following the verdict</figcaption></figure>



<p>Security was tight outside the court on Thursday, with dozens of police buses forming a cordon to restrict public access. Some 1,000 officers were deployed for security operations, local media reported.</p>



<p>Inside the court, judge Ji called Yoon the &#8220;insurrectionist leader&#8221;, although the judging panel found insufficient evidence to rule that he&#8217;d planned the martial law order a year before his announcement.</p>



<p>Yoon defended his actions throughout his trial, arguing that as president he had had the authority to declare martial law, sounding the alarm over opposition parties&#8217; obstruction of government.</p>



<p>He maintained that the order was necessary &#8220;to protect the freedom and sovereignty of the people and to preserve the nation and its constitution&#8221;.</p>



<p>The ruling Democratic Party, which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq549p1yd2eo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won the presidential election</a>&nbsp;after Yoon&#8217;s ouster, accused the court of &#8220;undermining judicial justice&#8221; by not sentencing Yoon to death.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Yoon] masterminded an insurrection that shook the very foundations of our nation,&#8221; party leader Jung Chung-rae said.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Today&#8217;s decision] is a clear regress from the people&#8217;s revolution&#8230; The public will find it deeply unsatisfactory and unacceptable.&#8221;</p>



<p>South Korea has not executed anyone on death row since December 1997, so even a death penalty for Yoon would, in effect, be life imprisonment.</p>



<p>Yoon is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4qdpxp78po" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already serving jail time</a>&nbsp;for abuse of power and obstructing his own arrest after the martial law order. He still faces three more related trials.</p>



<p>Several former presidents before Yoon had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93gqwek5jyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also been convicted and jailed</a>, but were pardoned after serving just two to five years in prison – and many expect the same for Yoon.</p>

<p>The Founder and Creative Director of Bullhaus Entertainment, Lawrence Nana Asiamah Hanson, widely called Bullgod, has shared how devastating it is to spend time in Ghana’s prison cells.</p>



<p>He stated that he spent a few days in police custody after being arrested and detained on the directives of former President Nana Addo Danquah Akufo-Addo.</p>



<p>Speaking on <strong>Changes </strong>on <strong>Joy Prime</strong>, Bullgod described the experience as scary and said it is not a place he would wish for anyone to be.</p>



<p>“I was held at the BNI cells for three days then I was moved from the BNI cells because they cannot prosecute me and they handed me over to the police. When I was done with my interrogation with the police, I was locked up for another two days. They made sure I was put in the hardest cells you can ever find in Accra. Like where they put armed robbers, rapists, killers, etc.”</p>



<iframe width="1351" height="482" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XjlgSDnh2Ko" title="Bullgod Opens Up About His &#39;Adopt a Prison&#39; Initiative &amp; Time Managing Shatta Wale!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“The place is scary,” he told the host Roselyn Felli, adding that it’s not a place he wishes for anybody to be.</p>



<p>He further revealed that the sting in the cells is horrible as there&#8217;s no enough ventilation. He noted that the washrooms are not sufficient for the inmates, making then struggle to ease themselves.</p>



<p>The terrible experience he encountered stemmed from him voicing his opinions and grievances in public, as he was a victim of the Menzgold saga, which was shut down by the Nana Addo Danquah Akufo-Addo-led administration, causing him to lose over 1 million cedis.</p>



<p>Following that, Bullgod has consistently expressed his dislike for the former president.</p>



<p>Based on his experience in the cells, the talent manager has introduced an initiative dubbed “Adopt a Cell” to help improve conditions in Ghana’s prisons and make them more comfortable for inmates.</p>

<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>



<p>This article evaluates the United States&nbsp;Southern&nbsp;District Court&nbsp;of New York’s&nbsp;decision in&nbsp;<a></a><em>Aubrey Drake Graham v. UMG Recordings, Inc</em><em>.</em>&nbsp;and considers&nbsp;its similarities as well as differences in the application of&nbsp;Ghana’s&nbsp;defamation law. It examines the boundary between artistic hyperbole and defamatory assertion, contrasts&nbsp;legal&nbsp;protections in both systems, and discusses implications for Ghana’s developing music economy and disputes arising from public lyrical confrontations among artistes. Utilising a comparative law methodology, this article undertakes a doctrinal analysis of the primary legal instruments governing freedom of artistic expression and reputational harm in Ghana and New York.&nbsp;The analysis reveals a significant divergence in the&nbsp;laws and its application. This comparative assessment of the different legal standards does not merely present&nbsp;a contrast but serves as a catalyst for jurisprudential reflection, challenging prevailing assumptions about free expression and reputation. The analysis is thus&nbsp;targeted at&nbsp;stimulating&nbsp;scholarly discourse and may prove instrumental in spurring specific law review commentary on&nbsp;whether it is&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;to evolveGhana’s defamation framework.</p>



<p><strong>I.</strong><strong>&nbsp;INTRODUCTION</strong></p>



<p>Rap&nbsp;battles&nbsp;have evolved into commercially significant cultural events. They generate audience engagement, streaming revenue, and reputational stakes. The global dispute between&nbsp;Aubrey&nbsp;Drake&nbsp;Graham (Drake)&nbsp;and Kendrick LamarDuckworth (Kendrick)&nbsp;produced allegations of sexual misconduct, domestic abuse,&nbsp;and&nbsp;pedophilia,&nbsp;amongst other things,&nbsp;in lyrical form.&nbsp;Drake sued UMG&nbsp;Recordings Inc. (UMG)&nbsp;alleging that UMG intentionally&nbsp;published&nbsp;and&nbsp;commercially&nbsp;amplified&nbsp;defamatory content&nbsp;made about him by Kendrick&nbsp;in his song “Not Like Us”.</p>



<p>Ghana’s music&nbsp;landscape&nbsp;has,&nbsp;over the years,&nbsp;experienced&nbsp;its fair share of&nbsp;public lyrical rivalries, including the widely publicised tension between&nbsp;“Stonebwoy”&nbsp;and&nbsp;“Shatta&nbsp;Wale”&nbsp;at the 2019 Vodafone&nbsp;Ghana&nbsp;Music&nbsp;Awards&nbsp;ceremony,&nbsp;“Medikal” and Strongman”, “Sarkodie”&nbsp;and&nbsp;“Asem”,&nbsp;just&nbsp;to mention a few.&nbsp;As the&nbsp;Ghana’s&nbsp;industry grows, clarity on the legal limits of artistic provocation remains relevant.</p>



<p><strong>II.&nbsp;</strong><strong>THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT: SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>Case:&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>Aubrey Drake Graham v. UMG Recordings, Inc</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>



<p>Drake, a popular artist collaborated with another artist,Jermaine Lamar Cole&nbsp;(J.Cole)&nbsp;on his album&nbsp;“FOR ALL THE DOGS”&nbsp;and made an assertion in a song titled&nbsp;“First Person Shooter”&nbsp;stating:&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“&#8230;.Love when the</em><em>y</em><em>&nbsp;argue the hardest MC, is it K-dot, is it Aubrey or me, we the Big 3 like we started a league&#8230;”</em></p>



<p>In March 2024, artists, Metro Boomin and Future released an album,&nbsp;“WE DONT TRUST YOU”&nbsp;which featured Kendrick&nbsp;in the song,&nbsp;“Like That”&nbsp;where Kendrick had this to say in response to J. Cole:</p>



<p><em>“..F</em><em>***</em><em>&nbsp;sneak dissin first person shooter&#8230;Motherf</em><em>***</em><em>the big 3</em><em>&nbsp;its just big me&#8230;”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Insinuating that Kendrick is the only one that is big in the rap&nbsp;at that moment. J. Cole responded in an album&nbsp;“MIGHT DELETE LATER”&nbsp;and&nbsp;in his last song&nbsp;“7 minute&nbsp;drill”,&nbsp;he&nbsp;stated&nbsp;that Kendrick is not as good as he thinks he is and his music is not doing&nbsp;well&nbsp;either. He later apologised and stepped out of the&nbsp;“Battle”&nbsp;leaving Kendrick and Drake to proceed with the feud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A.&nbsp;<strong>FACTS</strong></p>



<p>On&nbsp;April 19, 2024, Drake released a diss track directed at Kendrick&nbsp;and other rappers&nbsp;called “Push Ups”;&nbsp;where he mocked&nbsp;amongst other things&nbsp;Kendrick’s height and shoe sizeand questioned his success, he stated:</p>



<p><em>“..How the f</em><em>***</em><em>&nbsp;you big steppin with a size-seven men’s on.. pipsqueck, pipe down,&#8230; you aint in no big three&#8230;Im at the top of the mountain, so you tight now/just to have this talk with your ass, i had to hike down.”</em></p>



<p>A few days later, Drake released&nbsp;another song titled&nbsp;“Taylor Made Freestyle” which&nbsp;utilized&nbsp;artificially&nbsp;generated voices of rappers, Snoop Dogg and the late 2Pac. This&nbsp;song&nbsp;included encouragement from these rappers urging Kendrick to respond to the diss track Drake had made directed at him.</p>



<p>On April 30, 2024, Kendrick&nbsp;finally&nbsp;responded to Drake in a track titled&nbsp;“Euphoria”&nbsp;where he states that Drake is a manipulator, insults Drake’s fashion sense and taunts Drake for being a coward.</p>



<p>May 3, 2024, had both artists relasing tracks over the course of the day. Starting with Kendrick releasing&nbsp;“6:16 in LA”calling drake a terrible person and&nbsp;accusing&nbsp;Drake of playing dirty with propaganda. Drake reponds by releasing&nbsp;“Family Matters”&nbsp;where he jabs at Kendrick’s relationship with his partner. Almost immediately after, Kendrick released the track ‘Meet the Grahams’ in which he accuses Drake of being a ‘deadbeat’ father and also alleges that Drake has gambling and substance abuse problems. He further insinuates that Drake was a predator.</p>



<p>The next day, May 4 2024, Kendrick released&nbsp;“Not Like Us”, the song which sparked the suit against UMG. In this track Kendrick alleges that Drake is,&nbsp;and associates with pedophiles. The day after, May 5 2024, Drake responded in “The Heart Part 6”&nbsp;denying allegations of pedophilia and stated that he planted some information which Kendrick has used against him.</p>



<p>After what&nbsp;can only be described as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most infamous Rap&nbsp;battles&nbsp;in the genre’s history, Kendrick&nbsp;Lamar’s “Not Like Us”&nbsp;emerged as the penultimate of the feud.&nbsp;Drake&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;sued UMG, which coincidentally&nbsp;both artistshappen to have recording contracts with,&nbsp;alleging defamation, harassment, and unfair business practices. The gravamen of the case of Drake was that UMG had intentionally published and promoted the song,&nbsp;knowing full well that the insinuations contained in the song were false and defamatory. UMG’s legal representation filed a motion to dismiss the suit pursuant to the Federal Civil procedure rules applicable in the USA.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>B.&nbsp;</strong><strong>ISSUE</strong></p>



<p>In determining the motion to dismiss, the&nbsp;US District Judge Jeanette Vargas, set down as the legal standard for determination;&nbsp;<strong>“</strong><em>Whether statements made in a diss track could be reasonably understood as factual assertions capable of sustaining a defamation claim.</em><em>”</em></p>



<p><strong>C.&nbsp;</strong><strong>HOLDING</strong></p>



<p>The Court&nbsp;granted the motion&nbsp;filed by UMG&nbsp;and&nbsp;dismissed the claim, holding that the lyrics&nbsp;contained in the song&nbsp;constituted&nbsp;a&nbsp;“<strong>non-actionable</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>opinion</strong><strong>”</strong>&nbsp;when understood in their cultural and artistic context&nbsp;and as such no reasonable person would believe&nbsp;such insinuations&nbsp;or take them seriously.</p>



<p><strong>D.&nbsp;</strong><strong>LEGAL REASONING</strong></p>



<p>The reasoning of the&nbsp;Judge&nbsp;Vargas&nbsp;may be summed up in the following points;</p>



<p>Under New York law, the elements of defamation are:&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;A defamatory statement;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;Regarding the plaintiff;&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;Published to a third party;&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;That is false;&nbsp;(5)&nbsp;Made with the applicable level of fault;&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;Causing injury;&nbsp;(7)&nbsp;Not protected by privilege;</p>



<p>The court further defined a defamatory statement as&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>one that exposes &nbsp;an individual to public hatred, shame, obloquy, contumely, odium, contempt, ridicule, aversion, ostracism, degradation, or disgrace, or induces an evil opinion&nbsp;</em><em>of one in the minds of right-thinking persons, and deprives one of confidence and friendly intercourse in society”</em></p>



<p>The court, in resolving whether “Not Like Us” can reasonably be understood to convey as a&nbsp;matter of fact&nbsp;that Drake is a pedophile or that he has engaged in sexual relations with a minor, stated that the New York Constitution provides for absolute protection of opinions and therefore, the court must determine statements of fact, which are of a defamatory natureand expressions of opinion&nbsp;which are not defamatory and have the protection of the New York Constitution.</p>



<p>Whether a statement made is of fact or is an expression of an opinion is a question of law to be determined by the court based on whether an average person hearing or reading the communication would take it to mean.</p>



<p>The court at page 13 of the judgment in distinguishing between facts and opinions stated the following as&nbsp;the three guiding factors in the&nbsp;court’s&nbsp;consideration:&nbsp;Whether the specific language in issue has a precise meaning which is readily understood, whether the statements are capable of being proven true or false; and&nbsp;whether the full context of the communication in which the statement appears or the broader social context and surrounding circumstances are such as to signal readers or listeners that what is being read or heard is likely to be opinion, not fact.</p>



<p>In applying these factors to the case, the court was of theopinion that the recording is myopically focused on ensuring listeners take one message away, which is that&nbsp;<em>Drake is a pedophile</em>. The statement has a readily understandable meaning, and it is capable of being proven true or false.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;accusations of criminal behaviour are not actionable if, understood in&nbsp;<strong>context</strong>, and that context is what connotes that&nbsp;they are opinion rather than fact.</p>



<p>The court,&nbsp;in understanding the context in which the statement was made, considered what context means in the circumstances. Context according to the court, includes the forum in which the communication was published, the surrounding circumstances, the tone and language.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;forum:&nbsp;the forum in which a statement is made provides context which can inform the court’s analysis. The forum in this case is a music recording with&nbsp;an&nbsp;accompanying&nbsp;music&nbsp;video and&nbsp;a cover (album)&nbsp;art. The court was of the opinion that diss tracks are&nbsp;“more akin to&nbsp;publications on&nbsp;YouTube and X which encourages a freewheeling, anything goes writing style&nbsp;rather&nbsp;than journalistic reporting which is deemed more factual”. The court concluded that the average listener&nbsp;could&nbsp;not&nbsp;be&nbsp;under the impression that a diss track is a product or&nbsp;some&nbsp;investigation and thereby conveying to the public fact checked and verified content.</p>



<p>Surrounding Circumstances; the fact that the recording was made in the midst of a rap battle means that&nbsp;the audience would not reasonably conclude that those statements constituted assertions of facts when published in a diss track. The statements in “<em>Not Like Us</em>” which was deemed defamatory must not be considered without first looking at the context, which was a rap battle and&nbsp;as such, the court was of the opinion that the publications,&nbsp;whether or not would constitute actionable fact or protected opinion is not based upon the popularity they achieve,&nbsp;and if it&nbsp;was not&nbsp;actionable at the time it was initially produced, then its republication by UMG would not expose them to liability.</p>



<p>Tone and language; the lyrics in the song “<em>Not Like Us</em>” is&nbsp;filled with&nbsp;“profanity, trash-talking and hyperbolic language”which&nbsp;are all&nbsp;indications of opinion which a reasonable listener would not equate to accurate factual reporting. Although an accusation that a person is a pedophile is a serious one, the broader context of&nbsp;a heated rap battle with offensive accusations and provocative language hurled by both parties would not incline a reasonable listener to believe that “<em>Not Like Us</em>” imparts verifiable fact about Drake.</p>



<p>Image and Video; the court was of the opinion that the Imagery or Album art as well as the music video together constitutes an opinion as it shares the overall context as the recording itself.</p>



<p>The court thereby concluded that the diss-track environment signalled rhetorical exaggeration, not factual allegation, that Rap culture anticipates hyperbole and&nbsp;adversarial boasting, that no reasonable listener would treat the lyrics as verified fact that per New York’s constitutional protections treat such speech as opinion and lastly that no private right of action exists for the harassment provision cited.</p>



<p><strong>III.&nbsp;</strong><strong>GENERAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES FROM&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>DRAKE V UMG</em></strong></p>



<p>For the purposes of this article, the following principles are relevant in discussing the juxtaposition of the decision of Judge Vargas to Ghana’s&nbsp;law;&nbsp;</p>



<p>i.&nbsp;Defamation requires a false statement of&nbsp;fact not an opinion.</p>



<p>ii.&nbsp;Context and audience expectations determine whether language implies fact or opinion.</p>



<p>iii.&nbsp;Artistic speech has elevated protection&nbsp;of such publications&nbsp;in U.S.&nbsp;legal&nbsp;jurisprudence.</p>



<p>iv.&nbsp;Music industry “beef” is recognised cultural context in assessing meaning.</p>



<p><strong>IV.&nbsp;</strong><strong>GHANAIAN LAW</strong></p>



<p><strong>A.&nbsp;</strong><strong>CONSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Article 21</em></strong>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<strong>1992 Constitution</strong>&nbsp;protects freedom of expression, subject to limitations protecting reputation, public order, and morality.</p>



<p><strong>B.&nbsp;</strong><strong>DEFAMATION</strong></p>



<p>Post&nbsp;the&nbsp;abolition of criminal libel&nbsp;civil defamation remains actionable.&nbsp;A&nbsp;Plaintiff&nbsp;is required to&nbsp;prove&nbsp;that the&nbsp;publication of words&nbsp;has the potential of&nbsp;lowering reputation in the estimation of right-thinking members of society.&nbsp;Defamation is governed by customary law and the received English common law principles.&nbsp;Modern English defamamtion law consists of two torts,&nbsp;<strong>slander</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>libel</strong>. Under common law, there is a distinction between utterances and imputations conveyed in writing, signs&nbsp;or any other means or kind of permanence on statements. In essence, defamation may be actionable in libel without proof of special damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However,&nbsp;spoken defamation, libel, is under common law not actionale per se as a tort unless the utterances&nbsp;amount&nbsp;to some other crime like sedition, breach of peace or blasphemy. However, under Ghanaian Customary law, slander is actionable without proof of special damages.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>CUSTOMARY LAW</strong></p>



<p>The scope of defamation under customary law is wider than at common law as customary law protects reputation and injured feelings whereas defamation under common law protects reputation only. Customary law does not draw a distinction between libel or slander. In fact,&nbsp;<strong>Apaloo J.A.</strong>&nbsp;(<em>as he then was</em>) in the case of&nbsp;<strong>Anthony v.&nbsp;</strong><strong>UCC&nbsp;</strong>stated&nbsp;that;</p>



<p>“<em>it is elementary knowledge that while the tort of slander is known to customary law, libel is not, for the very sufficient reason that customary law knows no writing, nor I believe photography”</em></p>



<p>Libel is said to be unknown to customary law for the simple reason that the writing was unknown to customary law. Slander under customary law is actionable without proof of special damages. It is important to note that truth is not always a defence in customary law slander.</p>



<p><strong>ELEMENTS OF DEFAMATION</strong></p>



<p>Whether the issue before the court is for libel or slander;&nbsp;or it is under customary law or common law, the elements of the tort of defamation are the same and discussed below.</p>



<p>Proof that the communication is capable of a defamatory meaning. In the case of&nbsp;<strong>Simpson&nbsp;</strong><strong>v. MGN &amp; Anor</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Warby J</strong>stated that;</p>



<p><strong>“</strong><em>the natural and ordinary meaning of words for the purposes of a defamation claim is the single meaning that would be conveyed by those words to the ordinary reasonable reader</em>.”</p>



<p>In determining&nbsp;whether a communication is capable of a defamatory meaning, the English Common Law provides four tests namely; (a) that the communication substantially affects in an adverse manner, the attitude of other people towards a person;&nbsp;(b) that the communication was made deliberately or maliciously rendering him ridiculous or tends to hinder mankind from associating or having intercourse with him;&nbsp;(c) that the communication uses words that damage a person in his profession, business, office or trade; and&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;words spoken in the heat of a quarrel or argument are not defamatory.</p>



<p>The interpretation of the words&nbsp;determines&nbsp;whether or not they are defamatory;&nbsp;The words must be construed in their fair and natural meaning as reasonable, ordinary people will understand except where innuendo is pleaded. An innuendo is a defamatory imputation where extrinsic facts, known to the reader or listener, import into words spoken or the statement some secondary meaning, in addition to or alteration their ordinary meaning. Therefore, in a true innuendo, some extrinsic facts must be known to a group, which make the ordinary words defamatory.</p>



<p><strong>Reference</strong>:&nbsp;This means there should be reference to the plaintiff or something in the defamatory statement pointing to the plaintiff. Where the plaintiff’s name is not mentioned, there must be evidence connecting the plaintiff to the statement.</p>



<p><strong>Publication</strong>:&nbsp;Libel and slander protect reputation, therefore, unless the defamatory matter is published, a person’s reputation suffers nothing and thereby cannot be known as a defamatory matter. Publication is making the defamatory matter known, after it has been written or&nbsp;spoken&nbsp;to some persons other than the person of whom it is written or said.</p>



<p>With defamation, each repetition is a fresh publication, thus giving the plaintiff a cause of action.</p>



<p><strong>UNDERSTANDING THE SCOPE OF SLANDER</strong></p>



<p>Slander under common law requires proof of special damage. This means that a plaintiff can only succeed in an action in slander at common law when he can show that he suffered damage as a result of the slander. There are however four exceptions to this rule.</p>



<p>Imputation of crime;&nbsp;where a person verbally or orally falsely imputes that the plaintiff has committed a crime for which he could be punished corporally, it shall be actionable per se. Where the imputation attracts a fine, it shall not be deemed actionable per se. It is important to note that the imputation need not be an imputation of a specific crime, it is enough, if the words suggest that the plaintiff has committed some crime.</p>



<p>Imputation of a loathesome disease; where a person imputates that a person or the plaintiff is suffering from a veneral disease, the&nbsp;plaintiff is entitled to succeed as this act is deemed actionable per se. Example of such diseases are not expressly stated. However, there can be an implied notion that would show that diseases which are of a contagious and&nbsp;life-threatening&nbsp;condition, the plaintiff may succeed as right thinking members may shun the plaintiff.</p>



<p>Slander in respect of an office, profession and trade;&nbsp;where words are uttered about a person that tends to disparage him or her in his office, profession, trade or business, then those words are actionable per se.</p>



<p>Imputation of unchastity; in the United Kingdom, it is slander to impute unchastity to a woman under the Slander of Women Act,1891. This includes allegations of&nbsp;lesbianism. In Ghana,the law was laid down in&nbsp;<strong>Hotchand v. Gentleman&nbsp;</strong><strong>Salami (</strong><strong>1965) C.C. 187</strong>&nbsp;where Djabanor J. Stated that:</p>



<p>i.&nbsp;<em>Spoken words imputing unchastity to a woman are, under the customary law, actionable per se.</em></p>



<p>ii.&nbsp;<em>But it is also sound that, if at the time the words were uttered, there were circumstances known to the hearers, which clearly show that the words were not used in the sense of imputing unchastity, then no action lies.</em></p>



<p>iii.&nbsp;<em>Words like ‘prostitute’, etc. Which plainly impute unchastity cannot be actionable without proof of special damage, if it is clear that they were not intended to impute unchastity, but were spoken merely as quarrel, vituperation or abuse and were so understood by the hearers</em><em>.</em></p>



<p>Special&nbsp;damage:&nbsp;this means that the plaintiff has suffered a material loss as a result of the defamation. Material loss is quantified in money or pecuniary loss.</p>



<p>Causation:&nbsp;the test for causation is reasonable foreseeability as in negligence.&nbsp;The concept for foreseeability is narrower.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>DEFENCES TO DEFAMATION</strong></p>



<p><strong>Absolute Privilege</strong>:&nbsp;this defence covers the&nbsp;occasion&nbsp;or context in which the statement is made, the nature of the communication or the writer, the speaker or the publisher.Although the publication&nbsp;may be&nbsp;defamatory, the freedom of speech in certain circumstances can serve as a complete bar to the action. The four types of communication that is privileged&nbsp;are&nbsp;(a) Executive matters&nbsp;(matters relating&nbsp;to the&nbsp;state is considered privilege. This protectes diplomatic conversations and like communications)&nbsp;(b) Judicial Proceedings (any statements made before the bar or the bench are covered under absolute privilege. (c)Legislative proceedings (parliamentary proceedings are considered privilege such that parliamentarians enjoy immunity from court proceedings for acts, information and speeches made in parliament. (d) solicitor-client&nbsp;communications (communications&nbsp;between a lawyer and their client is covered&nbsp;under absolute privilege.</p>



<p><strong>Qualified&nbsp;</strong><strong>privilege:</strong>&nbsp;this comes to play where in the discharge of ones private or public duty, a fair statement is made, whether legal or moral, or in the conduct of his own affairs. This is also categorised into five (5) namely:&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;Words relating to matters of common interest, (2)&nbsp;Words protecting the interest of publisher, (3)&nbsp;Words protecting the interest of another, (4)&nbsp;Public interest, (5)&nbsp;Misconduct of a public official</p>



<p>Qualified privilege is destroyed by evidence of malice (improper motive). Qualified privilege will also be defeated by excess of privilege. This happens when the material is circulated beyond persons who should legitimately receive it.In&nbsp;<strong>Kojo Tsikata v Newspaper Pub</strong><strong>lishing&nbsp;</strong><strong>plc,&nbsp;</strong>it&nbsp;was held that inaccuracies will not undermine the protective cover of qualified privilege.</p>



<p><strong>Fair&nbsp;</strong><strong>Comment:</strong>&nbsp;comments made by people on matters of public interest&nbsp;are&nbsp;such comments being made honestly and without malice.&nbsp;For this defence to succeed, the defendant must satisfy the following conditions:&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;The comment must be on a matter of public interest, (2)&nbsp;The comment must be based on a fact, (3)&nbsp;The comment must be an opinion.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Justification</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;this defence means that the defendant says the publication is true. The defendant must establish the truth of all the material elements, or&nbsp;that the statement is substantially true.&nbsp;It must be noted that truth or justification is an absolute defence&nbsp;to common law defamation. Under English Defamation Act 1952, where several charges are levelled, proof of some, provided what is left does not materially injure the plaintiff, will be sufficient for purposes of the defence. But it must be noted that nothing stops the plaintiff&nbsp;on relying on the assertions that the defendant cannot establish.</p>



<p><strong></strong>a person who consents to the publication of the defamatory matter cannot succeed in a defamatory action concerning that consented publication.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>STATUTORY DEFENCES</strong></p>



<p>According to the second schedule of the Courts Act, 1993(Act 459),&nbsp;English statues shall apply in Ghana as statues of general application. The second schedule&nbsp;(section 119 (1)) states:</p>



<p><strong><em>Section 119—Application of English Statutes of General Application.</em></strong></p>



<p>(1)&nbsp;<em>Until provision is made by law in Ghana, the Statutes of England specified in the Second Schedule to this Act shall continue to apply in Ghana as statutes of general application subject to any statute in Ghana.</em></p>



<p>This provision makes the Libel Act, 1843(6&amp;7 Victoria, c.96) applicable in Ghana. Sections 1 &amp; 2 of the Libel Act,1843 states that&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><em>[1</em></strong><strong><em>.] Offer</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;of an apology admissible in evidence in mitigation of damages.</em></strong></p>



<p><em>In any action for defamation it shall be lawful for the defendant (after notice in writing of his intention so to do, duly given to the plaintiff at the time of filing or delivering the plea in such action), to give in evidence, in mitigation of damages, that he made or offered an apology to the plaintiff for such defamation before the commencement of the action, or as soon afterwards as he had an opportunity of doing so, in case the action shall have been commenced before there was an opportunity of making or offering such apology.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>[2</em></strong><strong><em>.] In</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;an action against a newspaper for libel, the defendant may plead that it was inserted without malice and without&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>neglect and</em></strong><strong><em>&nbsp;may pay money into court as amends.</em></strong></p>



<p><em>In an action for libel contained in any public newspaper or other periodical publication it shall be competent to the defendant to plead that such libel was inserted in such newspaper or other periodical publication without actual malice, and without gross&nbsp;</em><em>negligence, and that before the commencement of the action, or at the earliest opportunity afterwards, he inserted in such newspaper or other periodical publication a full apology for the said libel, or, if the newspaper or periodical publication in which the said libel appeared should be ordinarily published at intervals exceeding one week, had offered to publish the said apology in any newspaper or periodical publication to be selected by the plaintiff in such action; and to such plea to such action it shall be competent to the plaintiff to reply generally, denying the whole of such plea.</em></p>



<p>This means that&nbsp;a&nbsp;defendant&nbsp;may be allowed at the first opportunity to express remorse and offer amends. If this offer is rejected&nbsp;by the&nbsp;plaintiff, the defendant may refer to it in his or her pleadings.&nbsp;The Act requires&nbsp;that the court&nbsp;considerssuch offers&nbsp;in determining liability.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>C.&nbsp;</strong><strong>OPINION VS FACT</strong></p>



<p>Ghanaian courts recognise fair comment where opinions are honestly expressed on matters of public interest. However, an allegation implying criminal conduct ordinarily carries a defamatory meaning unless clearly rhetorical&nbsp;or made in the heat of an argument. There is no&nbsp;<em>First Amendment</em>&nbsp;equivalentof protected opinions in Ghana. Artistic&nbsp;speech does not enjoy the same elevated threshold as U.S. jurisprudence.</p>



<p><strong>V.&nbsp;</strong><strong>APPLICATION: IF THE CASE OF DRAKE V UMB AROSE IN&nbsp;</strong><strong>GHANA.</strong></p>



<p>A Ghanaian court would likely ask:</p>



<p>1.&nbsp;Would&nbsp;the&nbsp;reasonable listener interpret the lyrics as factual criminal&nbsp;allegations?</p>



<p>2.&nbsp;Was the language framed as artistic exaggeration or literal accusation?</p>



<p>3.&nbsp;Did publication by a label materially contribute to reputational harm?</p>



<p>Under&nbsp;our&nbsp;civil procedure, courts are generally slow to terminate civil claims at the pleading stage where the resolution of the dispute depends on contested questions of meaning, context, intention, or factual inference. Applications that seek to strike out&nbsp;pleadings or dismiss actions summarily are granted only in clear cases where the statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action or is plainly frivolous, vexatious, or an abuse of process. In defamation actions in particular, the determination of whether words are defamatory, whether they refer to the plaintiff, and how they would be understood by the ordinary reasonable listener are issues that are often fact sensitive and context driven. These matters typically require the court to consider evidence of audience perception, surrounding circumstances, and the manner of publication. Against this procedural&nbsp;background and&nbsp;given Ghana’s strong tradition of protecting reputation coupled with the absence of a constitutional doctrine that accords elevated immunity to artistic speech, a dismissal of a claim of this nature at the pleading stage would be less certain. A Ghanaian court would be more inclined to allow the matter to proceed to trial in order to determine context, meaning, and harm on the evidence.</p>



<p>The reasoning in&nbsp;<strong>Banson v Nana p</strong>rovides a vital interpretive bridge for modern questions about defamation in Ghana’s creative industry. Lassey J’s statement that;&nbsp;“<em>mere vituperations cannot constitute slander or defamation</em>” rests on the understanding that not every angry or offensive remark amounts to actionable defamation. The court drew a distinction between impulsive insults uttered in the heat of passion and deliberate statements that impute dishonesty or moral failing in a way that reasonable members of society would interpret as damaging to reputation. The decision confirms a central idea in&nbsp;Ghana’s&nbsp;defamation law: context and intent determine liability. Words spoken in anger may injure feelings, but only those that strike at moral or social standing become legally significant.</p>



<p>This principle, however, becomes complicated when applied to artistic production. The concept of mere vituperation assumes immediacy. It refers to speech that arises spontaneously in a moment of emotion or quarrel. In contrast, musical creation, particularly within contemporary rap and afrobeats culture, is&nbsp;<strong>planned, deliberate, and commercial</strong>. A diss track&nbsp;cannot be&nbsp;an impulsive statement,&nbsp;but&nbsp;it&nbsp;is a product of composition, recording, editing, mastering, and distribution. It is developed,&nbsp;marketed, and performed before audiences, both digital and physical. Each stage of the process reflects conscious choice and editorial control. The artist has sufficient time to reflect, reconsider, or even retract before public release. The final version represents not an unguarded reaction but a deliberate act of communication.</p>



<p>This difference matters deeply. In&nbsp;<strong>Banson v Nana</strong>(<em>supra</em>), the words were spoken in a market quarrel, yet the court still found them defamatory because they accused the plaintiff of dishonesty. If liability could arise from speech spoken in anger, it would be difficult to excuse calculated artistic speech that is produced through an extended and intentional process. A diss track is a publication within the meaning of the law,&nbsp;It is not spontaneous,&nbsp;but rather a&nbsp;deliberate form of communication intended for a wide audience. The conditions that excuse mere outbursts do not apply to such deliberate expression.</p>



<p>The comparison with the decision in&nbsp;<em>Aubrey Drake Graham v UMG Recordings, Inc.</em>&nbsp;highlights this difference in perspective. In that case, the United States District Court held that lyrical allegations in a rap rivalry were not actionable because they were rhetorical exaggeration and artistic bravado. The court relied on the cultural context of rap music and assumed that a reasonable listener would not interpret the lyrics as literal accusations of criminal behaviour. This reasoning fits within the American free speech tradition, where the First Amendment favours protecting artistic expression even when it shocks or offends. The court assumed that the audience&nbsp;could&nbsp;distinguish between performance and reality.</p>



<p>Such an assumption may not apply in Ghana’s legal and cultural setting.&nbsp;Ghana’s&nbsp;defamation law, shaped by both common law and customary values, attaches serious weight to communal interpretation and to the social meaning of speech. In a society where reputation functions as moral and economic capital, a diss track that alleges criminal or immoral behaviour can easily be understood as a factual statement.&nbsp;The average&nbsp;Ghanaian listeners may not always treat such lyrics as theatre.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is not difficult for people to&nbsp;perceive them as statements about real character, particularly when the artist names another person directly or implies concrete&nbsp;misconduct. Because the music industry in Ghana depends heavily on sponsorships, public image, and brand trust, reputational damage has real financial consequences.</p>



<p>Unlike a quarrel spoken in passing, a diss track is carefully prepared and commercially distributed. Its release across streaming platforms, radio, and social media&nbsp;which&nbsp;ensures extensive publication. Once released, the song can be replayed, quoted, remixed, and circulated indefinitely. The harm is multiplied by the reach of digital distribution and by the permanence of online archives. This permanence places the diss track within the legal category of libel rather than slander, since the communication exists in a recorded and enduring form. The “heat of the moment” reasoning cannot logically apply to such calculated speech.</p>



<p>The decision in&nbsp;<strong>Banson v Nana</strong>&nbsp;also undercuts the idea that emotional context absolves responsibility. The court there recognised that even words spoken in anger may be defamatory if they impute dishonesty or moral weakness. The principle that emerges is clear:&nbsp;<em>if liability may attach to impulsive speech, it is even more appropriate when the statement is prepared and published after reflection</em>. The diss track is not a slip of the tongue,&nbsp;it is the product of multiple decisions to create, refine, and distribute content that may damage another’s reputation. The argument that such speech should be excused as mere artistic competition weakens once its deliberate and commercial character is acknowledged.</p>



<p>From a policy standpoint, recognising this difference does not amount to censorship. It simply imposes a duty of care proportionate to the power of publication.&nbsp;Our&nbsp;music industry now operates as a professional and international business. Artists are brands, songs are products, and reputation is a form of property. When lyrical rivalries descend into allegations that can be understood as factual, the law should not treat them as harmless performance. The same principles that protect traders, politicians, and professionals from defamatory harm must apply to artists whose livelihoods depend on public trust.</p>



<p>This reasoning does not deny that rap battles and lyrical confrontations have cultural and artistic value. Rather, it argues that the line between artistic expression and&nbsp;defamation must be drawn with greater precision. The key question for Ghanaian courts should be how a reasonable listener, situated in Ghana’s cultural and social environment, would interpret the lyrics. Would they see them as playful exaggeration or as credible allegations of wrongdoing? The answer will depend on context, tone, and audience expectation. Where the words suggest criminality, moral corruption, or professional dishonesty, and where they are recorded, distributed, and monetised, the defence of artistic freedom should not automatically prevail.</p>



<p><strong>THE GHANAIAN RAP BATTLES AND THEIR IMPLICATION BASED ON GHANAIAN LAW.</strong></p>



<p>There have been many rap battles from different generations in&nbsp;the&nbsp;our&nbsp;music industry, spanning from the 1990s to date. However, for this article, we would focus&nbsp;on&nbsp;two different timelines in Ghana’s&nbsp;music history.</p>



<p>The first covered across the 2000s, with a resurgence around 2009 between hiplife musician and rapper, Michael Elliot Kwabena Okyere Darko, popularly known as&nbsp;“Obrafour”&nbsp;and musician, songwriter, and creative director, Kwame Nsiah-Apau popularly known as&nbsp;“Okyeame Kwame”.&nbsp;This rap battle’s central spark was with the release of “<em>Kasiebo</em>” a track by Obrafour featuring Guru. In this song, Obrafour tackles an earlier mentioned statement made by Okyeame Kwame in which he claimed to be the “best rapper alive”. In this track, which was creatively made to&nbsp;demonstrate a&nbsp;radio interview session between Guru and Obrafour, with Guru asking questions and Obrafour answering.&nbsp;In the second verse, Guru states:</p>



<p><em>“Nkra y3n nsa aka firi Kumasi ne s3</em><em>,&nbsp;</em><em>n</em><em>nwomtoni</em><em>&nbsp;OK,&nbsp;</em><em>nso</em><em></em><em>ak</em><em>)to mona</em><em>,&nbsp;</em><em>)de&nbsp;</em><em>abaayewa</em><em>&nbsp;bi a,&nbsp;</em><em>adi</em><em>&nbsp;nfie nw)twe aforo mpa</em><em>,&nbsp;</em><em>w)ayene no, wcay3 no dosodoso, awenyaa”</em></p>



<p><em>Which&nbsp;</em><em>transilates</em><em>&nbsp;to</em></p>



<p><em>“The message we have received from Kumasi is that the musician OK, has slept with a girl, who is seven years old, up, they have kidnapped her, they have&nbsp;</em><em>impregnated Her</em><em>”</em></p>



<p>The allegation made in Guru’s verse can only reasonably be understood as referring to Okyeame Kwame. At the material time, Okyeame Kwame was widely and popularly identified in&nbsp;the&nbsp;our&nbsp;music industry and in public discourse by the shorthand “OK”, a moniker derived directly from his stage name and frequently used by fans, presenters, and fellow artistes in interviews, media commentary, and musical references. There was no other prominent Ghanaian musician contemporaneously known by that designation in a manner capable of fitting the context of the song. The reference is therefore not ambiguous or generic, but one which ordinary listeners familiar with&nbsp;the&nbsp;our&nbsp;music scene would naturally and inevitably associate with Okyeame Kwame. Against that background, the lyrics, which allege that “OK” had sexual intercourse with a seven-year-old girl and impregnated her, amount to a direct imputation of sexual offences against a minor. Such an allegation falls squarely within the most serious category of defamatory imputations&nbsp;recognized&nbsp;under&nbsp;our&nbsp;laws, namely the imputation of a grave criminal offence punishable by imprisonment.</p>



<p>Such a statement is an assertion of a crime punishable by imprisonment and therefore constitutes defamation actionable per se under common law without the need to prove special damage. Authorities such as&nbsp;<strong>Gray v Jones</strong>&nbsp;<strong>[1939] 1 All ER 798</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Webb v Beavan</strong><strong>&nbsp;(1883) 11 QBD 609</strong>&nbsp;establish that imputing criminal conduct, particularly offences involving moral turpitude, exposes the claimant to hatred, contempt, and social avoidance, and&nbsp;our courts have consistently adopted this reasoning. Under customary law, the claim would be even more straightforward.&nbsp;<strong>Banson v Nana</strong>&nbsp;confirms that imputations of dishonesty, immorality, or antisocial behaviour in a communal setting are actionable per se, even where they arise in moments of anger. A fortiori, a recorded and distributed allegation of sexual misconduct with a minor is a deliberate communication that carries severe moral stigma. It would be difficult for a Our court to classify such a statement as mere vituperation, because diss tracks are not impulsive speech. They are crafted, recorded, mastered, and intentionally released, which places them in the category of libel. Libel is actionable per se, and the requirement to prove special damage does not arise.</p>



<p>The absence of a lyrical response from Okyeame Kwame does not convert the impugned lyrics into a rap battle in the legal sense. Defamation is assessed objectively from the standpoint of the ordinary reasonable listener, not by reference to whether the person targeted chooses to respond. Ghanaian courts do not require reciprocal artistic engagement before an allegation becomes legally significant. The controlling inquiry is whether a reasonable listener, familiar with&nbsp;the&nbsp;our&nbsp;music landscape at the material time, would understand the words complained of as referring to an identifiable individual and asserting a factual allegation about that person.</p>



<p>In the present case, the reference to “OK” must be understood in its full lyrical and contextual setting. The verse states that the allegation emanates “from Kumasi” and concerns a well known “nnwomtofo”, that is a musician, identified as “OK”. At the time the song was released, Okyeame Kwame was not only one of the most prominent musicians associated with&nbsp;Kumasi but&nbsp;was also widely referred to in the industry and in popular discourse by the shortened appellation “OK”, derived directly from his stage name. No other Kumasi based artiste of comparable prominence during that period was publicly known by that designation, nor was there any contemporaneous allegation of similar nature circulating in respect of another musician fitting that description. In those circumstances, an ordinary listener acquainted with the music scene would naturally and reasonably understand the reference to “OK” as pointing to Okyeame Kwame.</p>



<p>Viewed through this lens, the lyrics do not operate as abstract insult or metaphor. They convey a specific allegation of sexual intercourse with a minor, a grave criminal offence punishable by imprisonment. Ghanaian listeners are accustomed to treating such direct accusations of criminal conduct, particularly when tied to an identifiable individual and a specific location, as statements of real behaviour rather than figurative bravado. This accords with the reasoning in Banson v Nana, where imputations of moral wrongdoing were understood as serious attacks on reputation within Ghana’s communal culture.</p>



<p>Applying the essential elements of defamation, the statement is capable of a defamatory meaning because it imputes a serious crime. It refers to an identifiable&nbsp;person, namely Okyeame Kwame, through the contextual use of “OK” within the Kumasi music milieu. It was published through a recorded song that was released, distributed, and disseminated to third parties. These elements satisfy the requirements articulated in Pullman v Walter Hill and Co (1891) 1 QBD 524, Sim v Stretch [1936] 2 All ER 1237, and Knuppfer v London Express Newspapers [1944] AC 116.</p>



<p>The exchanges between “Shatta Wale” and “Yaa Pono” in&nbsp;<em>Say Fi</em>&nbsp;provide a stark illustration of how diss culture in Ghana can move beyond artistic provocation into actionable defamation. The lyrics are not framed as metaphor or coded bravado but as direct assertions of criminal conduct, sexual immorality, and social disgrace. In&nbsp;<em>Say Fi</em>, Shatta Wale accused Yaa Pono’s father of rape and alleged that Yaa Pono himself was the product of that rape. The lyrics state:</p>



<p><em>“I swear, I shock for your mother</em><em><br></em><em>Ano&nbsp;</em><em>go</em><em>&nbsp;blame am oo, but ebi your father</em><em><br></em><em>He rape am</em><em><br></em><em>Yaa your father rape am</em><em><br></em><em>So you, you be mistake</em><em><br></em><em>If you want make I continue, just say fi.”</em></p>



<p>These words amount to a direct imputation of the crime of rape against Yaa Pono’s father and simultaneously portray Yaa Pono’s mother as a victim of sexual violence. Under&nbsp;our&nbsp;laws, an allegation of rape is an imputation of a serious criminal offence punishable by imprisonment and is defamatory per se if false. Crucially, defamation law is not confined to the immediate target of a dispute. Where defamatory words clearly refer to identifiable third parties, those third parties may have independent causes of action. The lyrics do not merely insult Yaa Pono. They accuse his father of a grave crime and publicly expose his mother to humiliation and social stigma. This engages the principle that defamatory matter is actionable where it lowers the reputation of any person identifiable from the publication, whether or not that person is a participant in the underlying dispute.</p>



<p>In the same song, Shatta Wale further deployed language imputing same sex conduct to Yaa Pono in a derogatory manner. The lyrics state:</p>



<p><em>“See some batty man, weh ah roll with ah batty man, with ah man name Fatima,”</em><em><br></em><em>followed by</em><em><br></em><em>“M</em><em>ɛ</em><em>n nu wo hu n</em><em>ɛ</em><em>&nbsp;ats</em><em>ɛ</em><em>o l</em><em>ɛ</em><em>&nbsp;Yaa.”</em></p>



<p>In Ghanaian colloquial usage, the term “batty man” is widely understood as a pejorative reference to male same sex conduct. It is not employed neutrally, but as a term of ridicule intended to diminish social standing. The legal relevance of this imputation must be understood within Ghana’s statutory context. Section 104 of the Criminal Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29) criminalises what the statute describes as “unnatural carnal knowledge,” including sexual intercourse in an “unnatural manner,” categorising such conduct as a criminal offence depending on consent and circumstances. Without making any moral judgment, the existence of this statutory provision means that imputations of same sex conduct may reasonably be interpreted by the ordinary Ghanaian listener as allegations of criminal or morally proscribed behaviour.</p>



<p>Under Ghanaian defamation law, the central question is whether the words complained of would lower the person concerned in the estimation of&nbsp;right-thinking&nbsp;members of society. Where sexual conduct is invoked as a basis for ridicule, disgrace, or social exclusion, particularly against the background of Act 29, the imputation is capable of defamatory meaning. This approach aligns with received common law authority such as&nbsp;<em>Kerr v Kennedy</em>, which treated imputations of same sex conduct as defamatory per se, and with Ghanaian customary law jurisprudence such as&nbsp;<em>Hotchand v Gentleman Salam</em>, which recognises that words imputing sexual impropriety are actionable unless clearly understood as mere quarrel abuse.</p>



<p>The language used in&nbsp;<em>Say Fi</em>&nbsp;cannot reasonably be characterised as impulsive vituperation uttered in the heat of a personal quarrel. It forms part of a deliberately recorded and commercially distributed diss track. The lyrics extend reputational harm beyond the immediate target to identifiable third parties who are not participants in&nbsp;the feud. When assessed against Ghana’s communal understanding of dignity, family honour, and reputation, such imputations are capable of constituting actionable defamation if false and cannot be dismissed as harmless artistic bravado.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<em>Gbee Naabu</em>, Yaa Pono escalated the dispute by making a series of direct and specific allegations against Shatta Wale that fall squarely within established categories of defamation under&nbsp;our&nbsp;laws. The lyrics include the following statements:</p>



<p><em>“</em><em>girls</em><em>&nbsp;girls, shatta wale get aids oo, shatta michy no no say she dey spread oo, the pikins all u born no bi ur own oo, de whole ghana nim,&nbsp;</em><em>ɔ</em><em>b</em><em>ɔ</em><em>&nbsp;pampers.”</em></p>



<p>These statements allege that Shatta Wale is HIV positive, that his partner is spreading the disease, that his children are not biologically his, and that he “<em>ɔ</em><em>b</em><em>ɔ</em><em>&nbsp;pampers</em>.” In Ghanaian local parlance, the expression “<em>ɔ</em><em>b</em><em>ɔ</em><em>&nbsp;pampers</em>” is commonly used as a derogatory insinuation of same sex conduct. The phrase is not descriptive. It is deployed as a term of ridicule and social degradation, intended to portray the subject as sexually deviant in the eyes of the public.</p>



<p>The allegation that a person is suffering from HIV or AIDS falls within a&nbsp;well-established&nbsp;category of defamation. In&nbsp;<em>Bloodworth v Gray</em>, imputations of a contagious and repulsive disease were treated as defamatory per se because they naturally lead to social avoidance and stigma. Ghanaian courts have consistently recognised the social force of such imputations. The claims regarding the paternity of Shatta Wale’s children further impute sexual immorality and dishonesty, both of which strike at personal honour and family integrity. The combined effect of these statements is to portray Shatta Wale as diseased, sexually immoral, and socially untrustworthy.</p>



<p>The use of expressions such as “ɔbɔ&nbsp;bambers,” when understood against the background of Section 104 of the Criminal Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29), reinforces the defamatory character of the imputation. Where language commonly associated with criminalised or socially condemned sexual conduct is used as an insult, the ordinarylistener may reasonably understand it as an allegation of unlawful or morally&nbsp;reprehensible behaviour. This brings the imputation within recognised heads of defamation, including imputations of crime, sexual impropriety, and unfitness in one’s profession or calling.</p>



<p>These statements were made in a recorded song, intentionally released and widely disseminated across radio, streaming platforms, and social media. They therefore constitute libel and are actionable without proof of special damage. Applying the test of the reasonable listener, it would be difficult to characterise these lyrics as symbolic exaggeration or harmless performance. In a society where reputation functions as moral, social, and economic capital, allegations of HIV infection, sexual deviance, and illegitimacy are readily understood as factual claims. If litigated, a court would likely conclude that the lyrics in&nbsp;<em>Gbee Naabu</em>&nbsp;cross the boundary from artistic rivalry into actionable defamation under both common law and customary law.</p>



<p>A practical example in this regard could be the feud between the Ghanaian rappers “Medikal” and “Strongman”&nbsp;in mid-2019.&nbsp;The feud started after “Medikal”, the then VGMA Rapper of the Year, stated that he had “saved” the Ghanaian rap music. “Strongman” responded to this claim with a diss track.&nbsp;In their feud, Strongman in his song; “Don’t Try” made serious allegations against Medikal that if he subtracted his fraud money from his real&nbsp;money,&nbsp;he could not even buy a bicycle.&nbsp;The feud between the two rappers started when Medikal made a post on twitter in 2019 (now “X”) that he had been carrying the Ghanaian rap industry for the past four years. This post did not rub off very well with a host of rappers who also took to social media to express their opinions on the matter with the arguably one of the most vocal ones being Strongman. After the social media backlash, Medikal released the first song that would ignite the feud, the title of the song was “To whom it may concern” and although no direct references were made it was quite clear that it was addressed to Strongman.&nbsp;With lines like</p>



<p><em>“these yesterday rappers&nbsp;</em><em>dey</em><em>&nbsp;bore me, I for charge for features whenever they call me. Just because I live in one house with the kids does&nbsp;not mean them be homies, draw the line… You claim hot emcee but you still order uber,”.</em></p>



<p>Strongman in response released two songs back-to-back, namely&nbsp;“<em>don’t try</em>&nbsp;“and “immortal”.&nbsp;In the song&nbsp;‘Don’t try’, Strongman&nbsp;made the following statements</p>



<p><em>“</em><em>Subtract</em><em>&nbsp;your fraud money, from the real money,&nbsp;</em><em>nsesa</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>na</em><em>3b3ka 3kyere no it be your music money, it no fit buy you bicycle, my man you’re sounding funny, ka nokor3 kyer3&nbsp;</em><em>amansan</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>na</em><em>&nbsp;that be your testimony’</em></p>



<p>Throughout the song,&nbsp;statements were made that made it obvious that direct references were being made to Medikal. Strongman mentioned the titles of two previous hit songs and even went as far as mentioning his girlfriend at the time and his ex-girlfriend before that.&nbsp;He made the following statements:</p>



<p><em>“Controversies all the time&nbsp;</em><em>εnoa</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>na</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>εmaa</em><em>&nbsp;wo&nbsp;</em><em>hit.Too</em><em>&nbsp;risky ne&nbsp;</em><em>Omo</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>ada</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>nyinaa</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>εmaa</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>na</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>εboa</em><em>&nbsp;wo hit.”</em></p>



<p>After the release of this song, it sparked a protracted discourse on social media and mainstream media for weeks on the alleged or purported fraudulent activities of Medikal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the opinion of the authors, our courts&nbsp;should&nbsp;not&nbsp;in&nbsp;likemanner&nbsp;treat these lyrics as rhetorical exaggeration because the statements are specific, factual in tone, and communicated through deliberate and commercially produced songs. They exist in recorded form and therefore constitute libel rather than slander, meaning they are actionable without proof of any specific financial loss. The reasonable listener, unlike the American listener described in the&nbsp;<em>Drake</em>&nbsp;decision, does not automatically interpret such lyrics as theatrical persona building. In a society where reputation is a form of economic and social capital, an accusation that an artist is HIV positive, a rapist, gay, or a fraud can easily be understood as a statement of actual fact. If either party were to bring a defamation claim, the court would therefore focus on whether the lyrics impute a verifiable fact, whether the words refer to the claimant, and whether publication occurred. All three elements would clearly be satisfied. The legal analysis strongly suggests that the&nbsp;“<em>Say Fi</em><em>”&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;“<em>Gbee Naabu</em><em>”</em>&nbsp;battle, if litigated,&nbsp;could result in liability because the content goes far beyond artistic provocation and directly asserts&nbsp;criminal and immoral conduct capable of harming reputation in Ghana’s social and commercial environment.</p>



<p>Also&nbsp;in April&nbsp;2020,&nbsp;Sarkodie ( Michael Owusu Addo) fired some subliminal jab at fellow rappers in Ghana on sound engineer&nbsp;Appietus&nbsp;new hip-hop beat that was part of a social media challenge called #LockDownShow.&nbsp;Asem (Nana Wiafe Asante-Mensah) took Sarkodie on with a an equally fresh hot freestyle which went viral on Twitter. In the said freestyle, Asem called out Sarkodie for always making comparisons and bragging about his achievements and later called him by his social media alter ego “Kabutey”.&nbsp;Sarkodie released&nbsp;‘<em>Sub Zero</em><em>’</em>, a track laden with bars perceived as directed at Asemand other perceived Ghanaian rappers. Lines like&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“</em><em>rappers a&nbsp;</em><em>mo</em><em>&nbsp;a&nbsp;</em><em>dissi</em><em>&nbsp;me a&nbsp;</em><em>mootwen</em><em>&nbsp;reply, de3&nbsp;</em><em>moreye</em><em>&nbsp;no de3&nbsp;</em><em>eno</em><em>&nbsp;go fly,&nbsp;</em><em>m’adi</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>kan</em><em>&nbsp;aka akyer3&nbsp;</em><em>mo</em><em>&nbsp;dada mom moa&nbsp;</em><em>moho</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>na</em><em></em><em>mo</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>mmra</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>na</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>me’ndissi</em><em>&nbsp;obi a&nbsp;</em><em>ne</em><em>&nbsp;bottom ay3 dry.

<p>reinforced the perception that he was dismissing Asem’s attempts at rekindling relevance&nbsp;and that he is not ready to beef any artiste who is broke.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Asem’s immediate response, posted on social media&nbsp;with a series of freestyle videos, questioning&nbsp;Sarkodie’s&nbsp;relevance and suggesting&nbsp;Sarkodie needed to diss him to boost his own career, even calling him out for being and “over-hyped’ artiste.&nbsp;and followed by diss tracks, reignited one of Ghana’s most public lyrical rivalries.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<strong>Simpson v MGN Ltd supra</strong>, the English Court of Appeal held that words must be interpreted in their&nbsp;<strong>full context</strong>, including the genre and&nbsp;audience. To&nbsp;us&nbsp;this&nbsp;reasoning resonates strongly with Ghanaian audiences. Rap battles in Ghana,&nbsp;from Reggie Rockstone’s era to the current generation operate within a shared understanding that lyrical insults are part of artistic competition. Therefore, Sarkodie’s mockery of Asem’s “fading star” or Asem’s depiction of Sarkodie as a “corporate sellout” likely fall under&nbsp;artistic hyperbole&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;defamation. As we&nbsp;emphasize that the reasonable listener in Ghana’s music culture understands diss as performance, not factual journalism.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in 2018, Shatta Wale launched several verbal attacks on Sarkodie during interviews and public appearances, accusing him of hypocrisy, allegedly being broke, criticizing his music style and his authenticity as a rapper&nbsp;and stinginess.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sarkodie’s response came in the form of&nbsp;<strong><em>My Advice</em></strong>, a masterclass in calm but cutting lyricism. Without mentioning Shatta Wale by name, the track’s references were unmistakable. &nbsp;Sarkodie raps:</p>



<p><em>“</em><em>if being poor be like me then father I beg you just bless me with poverty, I don’t want to snitch on my nigga, but f**k all the bragging and chill cos honestly your whole bank account can’t buy you a tear rubber VO, but you claiming supremacy. F**k outta here you be full batti.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>In the second verse, the rapper continued to take lyrical jabs at Shatta Wale<em>:&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>“brand no be strong enough, if you be strong keep quite you go soon commot. I stayed mute&nbsp;</em><em>one year</em><em>&nbsp;saf full support, you showed d**k one day you go show buttocks”</em></p>



<p>and later adds:</p>



<p><em>“</em><em>this no be beef just stay and listen. Me and you cool no crazy friction. But my frustration be&nbsp;</em><em>say</em><em>&nbsp;I dey try move Ghana forward but I’m still babysitting. New money, new car, new house so you can’t think far…….. 3y3&nbsp;</em><em>wa</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>jimi</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>krakra</em><em>&nbsp;stay focused</em><em>”</em></p>



<p>The song immediately sparked debate across media about&nbsp;the limits of lyrical expression<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;particularly when lyrics carry factual insinuations about a person’s character or conduct.</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<strong><em>My Advice</em></strong>, Sarkodie portrays his target as immature, boastful, and financially reckless. Lines such as&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“You&nbsp;</em><em>dey</em><em>&nbsp;brag say you rich, but your bank no&nbsp;</em><em>dey</em><em>&nbsp;show am”</em></p>



<p>can easily be construed as personal&nbsp;attack.&nbsp;This&nbsp;impugnsirresponsibility and deceit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conversely, Shatta&nbsp;Wale’s&nbsp;responses, particularly&nbsp;in his song titled&nbsp;<strong>Little tip</strong>, he started by saying&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“&nbsp;</em><em>anka</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>anka</em><em>&nbsp;mom ana y3 de y3 star&nbsp;</em><em>anka</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>kwabena</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>awuke</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>woa</em><em></em><em>kwabena</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>awuku</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>anka</em><em>&nbsp;oy3 Galaxy&nbsp;</em><em>siaaa</em><em>…..the cash, the mansions, the cars (you no get some), my 3 range rovers (you no get some), my gold chain for my neck (you no get some), my&nbsp;</em><em>rolex</em><em>, diamond ring (you no get some)……. If you see boys dey shine p3 you say you dey help dem STRONGMAN, so when you go stop lie to Ghanaians AKWABOAH,&nbsp;</em><em>akoayi</em><em>&nbsp;y3&nbsp;</em><em>aboa</em><em>…</em><em>acehood</em><em>&nbsp;no she you be liar, thief stolen car you no be buyer, da b3n&nbsp;</em><em>na</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>Kaabutey</em><em>&nbsp;b3 tor Panamera, ago make your fans stop dey huh! And do de&nbsp;</em><em>paah</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>paah</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>paaah</em><em>…”</em></p>



<p>To let his audience aware he was dissing Sarkodie, he boldly mentioned his name in the chorus;&nbsp;<em>“ Sarkodie</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>yie</em><em>, you know me&nbsp;</em><em>yie</em><em>&nbsp;but you don’t know me&nbsp;</em><em>yie</em><em>, mi I get some dirty vibes, east&nbsp;</em><em>legon</em><em>&nbsp;and you say&nbsp;</em><em>klagon</em><em>, you know how much be one plot of land? JON”</em></p>



<p>Shatta wale however also made some defamatory claims against Sarkodie in the same song. He sang&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“ wo mom ate s3&nbsp;</em><em>kwahu</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>pipor</em><em>, if you say me&nbsp;</em><em>abi</em><em>&nbsp;batty you for prove&nbsp;</em><em>oooo</em><em>,&nbsp;</em><em>ano</em><em>&nbsp;be like dem stars you&nbsp;</em><em>dey</em><em>&nbsp;use&nbsp;</em><em>oo</em><em>, immigration go bring your&nbsp;</em><em>cocoain</em><em>&nbsp;news&nbsp;</em><em>ooo</em><em>, you just enter my life at dey wrong time, you no dey see she as you call my name you go worldwide”</em></p>



<p>These statements could, on face value, amount to allegations of dishonesty, theft and allegations of drug usage.</p>



<p>In this sense,&nbsp;<em>Banson v Nana</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Drake v UMG</em>&nbsp;represent two sides of the same legal puzzle. The former prioritises the protection of communal dignity and reputation, while the latter emphasises individual creative freedom. Ghanaian jurisprudence must find a balance that respects artistic innovation without undermining the value of personal honour. In a digital culture where music doubles as speech and speech doubles as commerce, that balance requires careful judgment. Spontaneity can excuse the unguarded tongue, but deliberation anchors responsibility. What separates mere vituperation from defamation is not the form of the expression but the intention, preparation, and impact behind it.</p>



<p><strong>VI.&nbsp;</strong><strong>INDUSTRY AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS IN GHANA</strong></p>



<p><strong>A.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Music Industry Practice</strong></p>



<p>Public rivalries can increase audience engagement. However, reckless criminal insinuations risk civil liability.</p>



<p><strong>B.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Contractual Considerations</strong></p>



<p>1.&nbsp;Morality clauses.</p>



<p>2.&nbsp;Defamation risk review before publication.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp;Label oversight mechanisms for content implicating reputational harm.</p>



<p><strong>C. Education and Governance</strong></p>



<p>Industry associations and entertainment-law practitioners should promote awareness of defamation standards and responsible lyrical content.</p>



<p>The Standard for Striking Out Pleadings in Ghana</p>



<p>The power of the courts in Ghana to strike out pleadings is one of the most delicate and exceptional judicial discretions. It is exercised under&nbsp;<strong>Order 11 Rule 18</strong>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<em>High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2004 (C.I. 47)</em>&nbsp;and also under the&nbsp;<strong>inherent jurisdiction</strong>&nbsp;of the High Court. The principle behind this power is to prevent abuse of court processes, eliminate frivolous or vexatious litigation, and ensure that justice is administered efficiently without unnecessary trials. However, because the right to be heard is a fundamental aspect of justice, this power is to be exercised sparingly and with great caution.</p>



<p><strong>Standard for striking out&nbsp;</strong><strong>Pleadings&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Order 11 Rule 18(1)&nbsp;of C.I&nbsp;47 provides&nbsp;as follows:</p>



<p>“The court may at any stage of the proceedings order any pleadings or anything in any pleading to be struck out on the grounds that;<br>(a) it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence;<br>(b) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;<br>(c) it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or<br>(d) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court,<br>and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly.”</p>



<p>Rule 18(2) further stipulates that:</p>



<p>“No evidence whatsoever shall be admissible on an application under rule (1)(a).”</p>



<p>This provision means that, when an application to strike out is made on the basis that a pleading discloses&nbsp;<em>no reasonable cause of action</em>, the court must determine the issue solely from the pleadings themselves. It cannot receive affidavit evidence or other extrinsic material, since the court must deem the factual averments in the statement of claim to be true for the purpose of the application.</p>



<p>This principle was affirmed in&nbsp;<strong>Ghana Muslim Representative Co</strong><strong>uncil v. Salifu&nbsp;</strong>, and restated in&nbsp;<strong>Jonah v.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Kulendi</strong><strong>&nbsp;&amp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Kulendi</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>, where the Supreme Court emphasized that the rule in both the old and current High Court rules must be interpreted consistently that&nbsp;the applicant is deemed to admit the truth of the opponent’s averments when moving under Order 11 rule 18(1)(a).</p>



<p><strong>The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court</strong></p>



<p>Aside from the rules of court, superior courts in Ghana possess an&nbsp;<strong>inherent jurisdiction</strong>&nbsp;derived from the common law. This jurisdiction exists to control the court’s own process, prevent injustice, and stop abuse of procedure. In&nbsp;<strong>Bremer Vulkan&nbsp;</strong><strong>Schiffbau</strong><strong>&nbsp;und&nbsp;</strong><strong>Maschinenfabrik</strong><strong>&nbsp;v. South India Shippi</strong><strong>ng Corporation Ltd&nbsp;</strong>, Lord Diplock described inherent jurisdiction as the court’s general power&nbsp;to control its own procedure so as to prevent the court from being used to achieve injustice..</p>



<p>Thus, while Order 11 Rule 18 provides a procedural foundation for striking out pleadings, the inherent jurisdiction of the court represents a broader and more flexible power one that is exercised to protect the integrity of judicial proceedings even in the absence of an explicit procedural rule.</p>



<p><strong>Difference Between Order 11 Rule 18 and the Inherent Jurisdiction</strong></p>



<p>Though both mechanisms yield similar&nbsp;results&nbsp;i.&nbsp;e&nbsp;the dismissal of an action or pleading, they differ in scope and procedure. An application under Order 11 Rule 18(1)(a) excludes affidavit evidence, while an application under the court’s inherent jurisdiction may rely on extrinsic evidence.</p>



<p>This was&nbsp;clarified in&nbsp;<strong>Okofo</strong><strong>&nbsp;Estates Ltd v. Modern Signs&nbsp;</strong><strong>Ltd,</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>where Akuffo JSC&nbsp;stated:</p>



<p>“In view of the clear differences in the established practices and procedures for invoking the two powers, the two cannot be considered to be interchangeable or simultaneous, unless they are both specifically applied for.”</p>



<p>Furthermore,&nbsp;<strong>Vinson v. The Prior&nbsp;</strong><strong>Fibres</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Consolidated&nbsp;</strong><strong>Ltd&nbsp;</strong>held&nbsp;that an application may invoke the court’s inherent jurisdiction even without labeling it as such, provided its grounds clearly show that such jurisdiction is being relied upon.</p>



<p><strong>Application and Timing of the Jurisdiction</strong></p>



<p>The jurisdiction to strike out is discretionary and may be exercised “at any stage of the proceedings.” However, courts have repeatedly stressed that such applications must be made&nbsp;promptly<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and not used to delay proceedings that have already advanced to trial. According to&nbsp;<strong><em>Bullen &amp; Leake &amp; Jacobs, Precedents of Pleadings</em></strong><strong>;</strong></p>



<p>“Although the application may be made at any stage of the proceedings, still it should always be made promptly and as a rule soon after the service of the offending&nbsp;pleading… the court may refuse to hear such an application after the action is set down for trial.”</p>



<p>This cautionary approach was adopted by the Supreme Court in&nbsp;<strong>Nene&nbsp;</strong><strong>Fiesu</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Gblie</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Gbenartey</strong><strong>&nbsp;&amp; Another v. Netas Properties &amp; Investment &amp; Othe</strong><strong>rs&nbsp;</strong>. In that case, the defendants applied to strike out a claim after issues had already been settled for trial&nbsp;which the lower courts allowed.&nbsp;Upon appeal to the&nbsp;Supreme Court, it&nbsp;held that although the rule allows striking out “at any stage,” the application was procedurally improper given the advanced stage of proceedings. Anin Yeboah JSC (as he then was) emphasized that striking out should only be used in&nbsp;plain and obvious cases&nbsp;and not where contentious issues exist that require trial.</p>



<p><strong>Cautionary Principles and Judicial Discretion</strong></p>



<p>The courts have consistently maintained that the power to strike out pleadings should be exercised with utmost restraint. In&nbsp;<strong>Dyson v.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Attorney-</strong><strong>General,</strong>&nbsp;Fletcher-Moulton LJ warned:</p>



<p>“Our judicial system would never permit a plaintiff to be driven from the judgment seat in this way… except in cases where the cause of action was obviously and almost incontestably bad.”</p>



<p>This principle was echoed in&nbsp;<strong>Republic of Peru v</strong><strong>. Peruvian Guano&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Hubbuck</strong><strong>&nbsp;&amp; Sons Ltd v. Wilkinso</strong><strong>n Heywood &amp; Clark&nbsp;</strong>, where courts cautioned against prematurely terminating proceedings without a full trial, except where a claim is clearly unsustainable or frivolous.</p>



<p>In Ghana,&nbsp;<strong>Professor Stuart Sime</strong>, in&nbsp;<em>A Practical Approach to Civil Procedure</em>, similarly observed that ;</p>



<p>“The jurisdiction to strike out is to be exercised sparingly, because striking out deprives a party of its right to a trial… Striking out is limited to plain and obvious cases where there is no point in having a trial.”</p>



<p><strong>Allegations of Fraud and the Need for a Full Trial</strong></p>



<p>One key restriction on the use of this jurisdiction arises where&nbsp;fraud is alleged. Allegations of fraud require evidential&nbsp;proof and&nbsp;therefore cannot be summarily dismissed. In&nbsp;<strong>Okofo</strong><strong>Estates Ltd v. Modern Signs Ltd (supra)</strong>, Edward Wiredu JSC emphasized:</p>



<p>“An allegation of fraud goes to the root of every transaction… A denial of an allegation of fraud raises a triable issue which a court cannot determine summarily.”</p>



<p>Similarly, in&nbsp;<strong>Gblie</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Gbenartey</strong><strong>&nbsp;v. Netas Properties (supra)</strong>, the Supreme Court condemned the lower court’s dismissal of a case involving allegations of fraud without hearing evidence, describing the approach as “a violation of natural justice.”</p>



<p><strong>Guiding Principle for Striking Out Pleadings</strong></p>



<p>The general discretion of courts in striking out pleadings is well summarized in&nbsp;<strong>Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed., Vol. 37, para. 430)</strong>:</p>



<p>“The powers are permissive, not mandatory, and will be exercised in the light of all the circumstances. The court will not lightly drive a party from the seat of judgment, but the jurisdiction will be exercised in the clearest of cases to prevent harassment and expense from frivolous, vexatious or hopeless litigation.”</p>



<p>Therefore,&nbsp;under Ghanaian&nbsp;jurisprudence, the standard for striking out pleadings is guided by both statutory and inherent judicial principles. The courts will only strike out a claim where it&nbsp;clearly discloses no reasonable cause of action<strong>, is&nbsp;</strong>frivolous, vexatious<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>or amounts to an<strong>&nbsp;</strong>abuse of process<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The power must be exercised<strong>&nbsp;</strong>sparingly,&nbsp;cautiously, and only in plain and obvious cases, especially not where factual disputes or allegations of fraud exist that require full evidential examination. The ultimate aim of this jurisdiction, as the Supreme Court consistently reminds, is not to drive parties away from the judgment seat but to uphold the integrity of justice and ensure fair trial in accordance with due process.</p>



<p><strong>VII.&nbsp;</strong><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>



<p><em>Drake v UMG</em>&nbsp;reinforces that diss-track accusations operate within a protected artistic speech tradition under U.S. law. Ghana balances artistic expression with stronger protection of reputation. As Ghana’s music industry evolves, legal guidance and contractual discipline can promote creativity while safeguarding rights and public trust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The recent killing of Ghanaian tomato traders in Burkina Faso has exposed a dangerous intersection between national security and agricultural dependency. This tragedy is not an isolated border incident but a symptom of a systemic failure to decouple Ghana’s food supply from the volatile Sahel. As extremist violence descends from the arid north, Ghana’s reliance on cross-border trade has transformed a simple vegetable supply chain into a high-stakes security gamble. The massacre near Titao serves as a grim reminder that when a nation&#8217;s dinner table depends on a war zone, the cost of a meal is often paid in human lives.</p>



<p><strong>Military Intervention and Medical Evacuation</strong></p>



<p>In a decisive response to the February 14 massacre, the Ghana Armed Forces (GAF) successfully executed a high-stakes medical evacuation of survivors. On Tuesday, February 17, 2026, a Ghana Air Force aircraft was dispatched to Burkina Faso as part of a coordinated humanitarian and security mission. Three Ghanaian traders, who sustained critical injuries during the ambush, were flown back to Accra for urgent specialised care.</p>



<p>According to a formal statement released by the GAF on Wednesday, February 18, 2026, the survivors were immediately transported to the 37 Military Hospital upon arrival. The military command confirmed that the mission was authorised to ensure the safety of citizens caught in the crossfire of regional terrorism. “The evacuation reflects the government&#8217;s unwavering commitment to the well-being of its citizens abroad,” the GAF statement noted, while also extending deep condolences to the families of the deceased.</p>



<p><strong>Diplomatic Alerts and New Travel Restrictions</strong></p>



<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has officially revised the death toll to eight Ghanaian nationals. While seven members of the Tomato Traders Association were killed instantly in the &#8220;mindless act of terror,&#8221; an eighth victim succumbed to injuries while undergoing treatment. In response, the Ministry has issued an immediate high-consular alert across West African missions.</p>



<p>For the first time since the escalation of Sahelian violence, the government has implemented formal travel guidelines for Ghanaians. Citizens planning essential travel to high-risk zones must now consult the Ministry or relevant diplomatic missions before departure. Furthermore, Ghanaians currently residing in volatile jurisdictions are being urged to restrict movement and maintain open lines of communication with the Embassy in Ouagadougou. The MFA has established emergency hotlines and email addresses to provide real-time consular support as the regional security situation remains fluid.</p>



<p><strong>Witness Accounts and Sahelian Instability</strong></p>



<p>New details have emerged regarding the brutal sequence of events on February 14. Eric Tuffour, President of the Tomato and Onion Truck Drivers Association, provided a harrowing account of the ambush in Titao. Terrorists suspected &#8220;enemies&#8221; had entered the town and specifically targeted a truck carrying 18 traders. The attackers separated passengers by gender, ordering women to step aside before executing the men. “All the men who were seated on top of the vehicle were shot dead,” Tuffour recounted, noting that eleven men were killed on sight. The driver attempted to save himself by locking the cabin doors, but the terrorists set the vehicle ablaze with him inside.</p>



<p><strong>Presidential Condolences and Policy Shifts</strong></p>



<p>President John Mahama extended formal condolences to the affected families during the Ghana Tree Crops Investment Summit on February 17, 2026. Condemning the attack as a &#8220;mindless act of terror,&#8221; the President stressed the urgent need for renewed collective regional security efforts. The President highlighted the GAF&#8217;s activation as a necessary state intervention, framing the event as a significant national security breach.</p>



<p><strong>Techiman Market: Grief and the Demand for Irrigation</strong></p>



<p>The Techiman Central Market fell silent on Monday, February 16, 2026, as the community mourned the victims killed in the ambush. Market leaders describe the risks of crossing the border as now &#8220;unbearable.&#8221; Madam Akua, a veteran trader, noted the desperation of the trade: “We go there because we have no choice, but now we fear we are walking into a trap.” Comfort Aframah, Patron of the Techiman Tomato Traders Association, is now leading calls for the administration to prioritise irrigation over symbolic gestures.</p>



<p><strong>Pivoting to Value Addition: The Cocoa Parallel</strong></p>



<p>President Mahama used the summit to urge a fundamental shift away from raw material exports, citing the current cocoa liquidity crisis as a warning. He noted that the instability of raw exports remains a permanent threat without local processing and value addition. &#8220;We must take advantage of this crisis to make a pivotal change in how we handle our raw exports,&#8221; the President declared. By drawing parallels between cocoa and the tomato crisis, the administration is framing food sovereignty as the ultimate defense against regional volatility.</p>



<p><strong>Full-Scale Local Production by Year-End</strong></p>



<p>Deputy Minister for Food and Agriculture John Dumelo announced that Ghana is on track for full-scale tomato production by the end of 2026. Trials are currently underway at the Tono Irrigation Scheme and in Akomadan to identify high-yield varieties suitable for Ghana’s soil. “Once these irrigation schemes come fully on stream, we expect tomato imports to reduce by at least half by the end of the year,” Dumelo noted.</p>



<p><strong>Short-Term Security and Diplomatic Engagement</strong></p>



<p>While local production scales up, the government is engaging Burkinabè authorities to provide immediate protection for traders. The Ministry of the Interior confirmed that the Ghana Embassy in Burkina Faso is actively coordinating with local security forces. Dumelo indicated that the Ministry of Agriculture is also exploring &#8220;security aid&#8221; for convoys moving through high-risk zones.</p>



<p><strong>National Security Strategy and the Cost of Inaction</strong></p>



<p>Security consultant Professor Kwesi Aning’s critique highlights a troubling gap between policy design and field implementation. While the National Security Strategy identified these threats six years ago, the lack of previous travel advisories suggested a breakdown in the state&#8217;s duty of care. The new MFA guidelines represent a belated but necessary alignment with the Professor&#8217;s call for systemic protection. Impact on Trade and Food Security: Ghana’s dependence on Burkina Faso for tomatoes creates an acute vulnerability that extremist groups are now exploiting. According to the Chamber of Agribusiness Ghana, the country loses roughly GHS 5.7 billion annually due to this dependency, representing 1.2 per cent of the national GDP. The Chamber warns that unless production is decentralised, seasonal price spikes of up to 40% will become a permanent fixture in the Ghanaian economy.</p>



<p><strong>Regional Cooperation and Political Fallout</strong></p>



<p>The tragedy puts a strain on diplomatic relations at a time when regional cooperation is most needed. Vice President and NPP flagbearer Dr Mahamudu Bawumia has called for &#8220;deepened intelligence collaboration&#8221; with neighbours. However, Michael Okyere Baafi, Ranking Member on Parliament’s Trade Committee, has labelled the lack of timely advisories as “criminal negligence.”</p>



<p><strong>From Symbolic Gestures to Structural Reform</strong></p>



<p>The current crisis demands a transition from symbolic gestures to substantive structural reform. Professor Aning criticised the government’s overreliance on events like Farmers’ Day, noting that authorities reward a single farmer while ignoring the broader community. The Chamber of Agribusiness is now providing GHS 20,000 in emergency relief to affected families and plans to begin constructing the first 10 cold storage facilities in Q2 2026. The administration must now choose: manage the fallout of border tragedies or take the bold steps required to secure Ghana’s food system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The governing National Democratic Congress (NDC) has maintained its call for the removal of the Electoral Commission’s leadership, despite the Chief Justice’s dismissal of petitions seeking their ouster.</p>



<p>The party’s Legal Director, Edudzi Tamakloe, speaking on <strong>Joy FM’s Super Morning Show</strong> on Thursday,<strong> </strong>February 19, says the decision will not alter the NDC’s position that the current EC Chair and her deputies should step aside.</p>



<p>“I want to make the point that the NDC still believes that the current composition of the Electoral Commission and how they have conducted their work over the past five years leaves much to be desired,” he said.</p>



<p>Chief Justice Paul Baffoe-Bonnie, in dismissing the <a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/mahama-rejects-removal-petitions-after-cj-finds-no-prima-facie-case-against-ec-osp-leadership/">petitions seeking the removal of EC heads and the Special Prosecutor</a>, acknowledged that the concerns raised were serious but ruled that they did not meet the prima facie threshold required under Article 146 to trigger a removal process.</p>



<p>The ruling has generated mixed reactions across the political landscape.</p>



<p>However, Mr Tamakloe insisted the party remains resolute.</p>



<p>He added that while the Chief Justice appeared to recognise the administrative and constitutional weight of the issues raised, the dismissal suggests that the proper avenue may lie elsewhere.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“From what I am reading, it does appear that the Chief Justice has taken the position that the matters raise very serious administrative and constitutional issues, and so possibly the fault is not Article 146 alone. Those matters can be litigated in a different place other than the Supreme Court,” he noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minority MP for Manhyia South, Nana Agyei Baffour Awuah, has called for legislation to clearly define how prima facie cases are determined to prevent inconsistencies in judicial decisions.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy FM’s Super Morning Show, Mr Awuah said he believes there is a lack of consistency between the recent dismissal of petitions against the Electoral Commission (EC) officials and the ruling that removed former Chief Justice Gertrude Torkornoo.</p>



<p>The Chief Justice, Paul Baffoe-Bonnie, ruled that there was no prima facie evidence to justify further investigation into petitions calling for the removal of the Electoral Commissioner, her deputies, and the Special Prosecutor.</p>



<p>This was confirmed by the Minister of Government Communications in a statement issued on Wednesday, February 18.</p>



<p>“Where there has been a specific breach of the Constitution, you claim that it hasn’t established a prima facie case. That is why we have stated that this issue about what constitutes a prima facie case in respect of Article 146 should be reduced into law,” Mr Awuah argued.</p>



<p>He warned that leaving the determination of such cases to discretionary power risks different standards being applied to different individuals.</p>



<p>“Unless it is reduced into law, it becomes a discretionary power of whoever is making the decision, and this is where it is not good. Otherwise, we risk a situation where different standards are going to be applied to different people based on the disposition of whoever is exercising that discretion and what he thinks of that person,” he added.</p>



<p>Mr Awuah said a clear statute would ensure uniformity and prevent scenarios where similar cases are judged differently.</p>



<p>“So this raises fundamental questions, and I think that we need a statute to resolve these issues because we can’t have a situation where different principles or standards are applied to different officials holding the same or similar conditions,” he said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cocoa farmers in the Western North Region have staged a demonstration to protest the recent reduction in cocoa prices from GH¢3,625 to GH¢2,587 per bag.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cocoa farmers in the Western North Region took to the streets on Thursday, February 19, 2026, to protest the government’s recent reduction of the cocoa producer price from GH¢3,625 to GH¢2,587 per 64‑kilogram bag, calling the move unfair and damaging to their livelihoods. </p>



<p>Farmers from districts such as Sefwi Wiawso, Juaboso and Bia West marched through principal streets, waving placards reading <em>“Restore Our Price Now”</em> and <em>“Cocoa Sustains Ghana, Don’t Neglect Farmers.”</em> Many argued that rising costs for labour, fertiliser and transport mean the new price barely covers production expenses. </p>



<p>The price cut, announced by Finance Minister Dr Cassiel Ato Forson on February 12, 2026, followed a decision by the government and the Producer Price Review Committee (PPRC) to align farmgate prices with international market realities amid a sharp fall in global cocoa prices. </p>



<p>The adjustment sets the producer price at GH¢41,392 per tonne — equivalent to GH¢2,587 per bag — for the remainder of the 2025/2026 crop season, a 28 % reduction from the earlier rate. </p>



<p>Officials say the move was intended to restore liquidity in the cocoa sector and enable timely payments to farmers, many of whom had faced payment delays due to unsold stocks and financial pressures at the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD). </p>



<p>The protest underscores deepening tensions in Ghana’s cocoa sector, where pricing policy, global market volatility and ongoing reforms at COCOBOD are shaping the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of farmers nationwide.</p>

<p>But farmers and political actors have reacted strongly. </p>



<p>The New Patriotic Party (NPP) Minority in Parliament condemned the mid‑season cut as a betrayal and called for its reversal, while civic groups like the People’s Forum have launched billboard campaigns across multiple regions to highlight farmers’ struggles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Australian sports presenter has apologised after a clip of her slurring her way through a live cross from the Winter Olympics in Italy went viral, with even Australia&#8217;s prime minister weighing in.</p>



<p>Channel Nine reporter Danika Mason said she had &#8220;misjudged the situation&#8221; by drinking ahead of her appearance on live television, also blaming the altitude, the cold and her failure to eat dinner.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to take full responsibility, it&#8217;s not the standard I set myself,&#8221; she said during another appearance a day later, adding that she was &#8220;embarrassed&#8221;.</p>



<p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was &#8220;pro-Danika&#8221; and that there was &#8220;nothing to see here&#8221; suggesting she had been affected by jet lag.</p>



<p>Mason stumbled over her words and talked about iguanas and the price of coffee as she reported on the day&#8217;s sports events.</p>



<p>&#8220;Literally like the price of coffee over here is actually fine, it&#8217;s more the price of coffee in the US that we&#8217;re gonna have to get used to. I&#8217;m not sure about the iguanas, where are we going with that one?&#8221; she said during her cross to the breakfast television show Today on Wednesday, apparently in response to comments from the studio hosts.</p>



<p>With glazed eyes she then stumbled through the rest of her sports report, mixing up her words as well as the UK and the US, while studio host Karl Stefanovic could be heard laughing in the background.</p>



<p>&#8220;Look the cold weather is a thing, right,&#8221; Stevanovic said unprompted afterwards. &#8220;You can&#8217;t actually move your lips.&#8221;</p>



<p>Social media clips of her report prompted mixed reactions from Australians.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good on her, nothing wrong with this. You can tell she&#8217;s having an absolute ball over there,&#8221; said one person on X, while another commented: &#8220;If it&#8217;s not a health issue, she should be sacked on the spot &#8211; very unprofessional.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mason, a prominent sports reporter best known for her National Rugby League coverage, appeared again on the Today show on Thursday morning.</p>



<p>After she delivered her live report, she told viewers she wanted to &#8220;take a moment, if that&#8217;s OK, just to apologise&#8221; for her previous appearance.</p>



<p>She thanked viewers for messages of concern and continued: &#8220;I&#8217;m OK, probably just a little embarrassed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Look, I totally misjudged the situation, I shouldn&#8217;t have had a drink, especially in these conditions, it&#8217;s cold, we&#8217;ve got altitude, and not having had dinner probably didn&#8217;t help as well. But I want to take full responsibility, it&#8217;s not the standard I set myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;So in saying that, I&#8217;m genuinely really sorry and I&#8217;m thanking everyone for those messages I&#8217;ve received as well.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Today show host Jayne Azzopardi responded saying &#8220;we know how hard you work, Danika&#8221; while Stefanovic called her a &#8220;legend&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dr Alhaji Abubakari Sidick Ahmed the quiet architect behind decades of campus broadcasting excellence passed on. And in his passing, the University community was reminded of a truth we often postpone until it is too late: ‘;We do not always honor our builders while they are alive’;.</p>



<p>For over three decades, he stood tall not with noise, but with nobility. Not with power, but with principles. Not with praise, but with purpose.</p>



<p>He sacrificed comfort to build dreams. He chose mentorship over personal ambition. He chose discipline over convenience. He chose institutional growth over personal spotlight.</p>



<p>Many of Ghana’s finest broadcasters first held a microphone under his supervision. Many newsroom leaders across the country trace their foundation to his guidance. Generations passed through his watch but his standards never lowered.</p>



<p>He did not simply manage Radio Univers</p>



<p>He defined it.</p>



<p>He built its culture of research.</p>



<p>He enforced its ethics.</p>



<p>He protected its credibility.</p>



<p>He sustained its institutional memory while student leadership changed year after year.</p>



<p>Traditionally, Radio Univers has provided volunteering opportunities primarily to students of the University of Ghana. However, Dr Alhaji Abubakari Sidick Ahmed believed that talent and passion should never be confined strictly by enrollment status.</p>



<p>When he encountered individuals who demonstrated genuine commitment, discipline, and potential even if they were not UG students he extended mentorship and professional training opportunities to them.</p>



<p>I stand as one of those beneficiaries. Though I was not a University of Ghana student, he saw something worth nurturing and chose to invest in it.</p>



<p>Today his protégés now stand at the helm of Ghana’s leading media institutions shaping conversations on national television, major radio stations, and digital platforms while others carry his imprint across Africa and onto the global stage.”<br>That was the kind of leader he was principled, discerning, and inclusive.</p>



<p>A newsroom is not merely a space with desks and microphones.<br>It is the heartbeat of a station.<br>It is where truth is refined, where young voices are shaped, and where future media leaders are trained.</p>



<p>If there is any place that carries his imprint most visibly, it is the newsroom.</p>



<p>Naming the Radio Univers Newsroom after Dr Alhaji Abubakari Sidick Ahmed is not an emotional request. It is an institutional obligation.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because legacy must be made permanent.<br>Because institutions that fail to memorialize their builders risk forgetting the very foundations they stand on.</p>



<p>Because future broadcasters deserve to walk into that space, see his name, and ask, “Who was he?” and in hearing the answer, understand the standard expected of them.</p>



<p>This is bigger than sentiment. This is about justice.</p>



<p>History will not remember how loudly we mourned him.<br>It will remember what we institutionalized in his honor.</p>



<p>The least and the most powerful thing the University of Ghana can now do is to ensure that his name is permanently engraved in the place he helped build.</p>



<p>Let the newsroom bear his name.</p>



<p>Let every script written there carry his invisible signature.</p>



<p>Let every bulletin echo his principles.<br>Let his three decades of sacrifice remain a living presence within the walls he strengthened.</p>



<p>We cannot bring him back.</p>



<p>But we can ensure that we honor him properly.</p>



<p>And we must begin now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Emmanuel Kofi Botwe, known in showbiz as Kwaw Kese, has opened up in an interview with <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0">George Quaye</a> on <em>Prime Time </em>on <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1">Joy Prime</a>, offering insight into his life, beliefs, struggles and aspirations beyond music.</p>



<p>Born a Christian, <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=2">Kwaw Kese</a> explained that his spiritual journey has evolved over time. He now identifies as a traditionalist and herbalist, stressing that faith, for him, goes beyond rigid labels.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was born into a Christian home so in Ghana you identify as a Christian but growing up I went through some transformations. Ata point I started practicing Islam, and they gave me the name Kamal. And later I delved into traditional religion because I believe that is for us. There is a saying that the Bible was brought by the white man. Before they came we were worshipping God,&#8221; he said. </p>



<p>Asked where he stands at present as in terms of religion, he said &#8220;I am a traditionalist, herbalist.&#8221; </p>



<p>Kwaw Kese spoke with pride about fatherhood, revealing that he is blessed with three children, two girls and a boy. He shared his excitement over his daughters’ growing talents, noting that they already play the piano and sing. For him, legacy is everything. He believes that at least one of his children must follow his path and take their talent global, carrying the family’s name beyond Ghana’s borders.</p>



<p>Before music defined his life, Kwaw Kese dreamed of becoming a lawyer. While attending Winneba Senior High School, he consistently ranked among the top five students. His only academic hurdle was French, which he struggled with due to what he described as an uninspiring teaching approach. Despite everything, the dream of law has not faded. He says that if the opportunity arises, he would still love to pursue it. With humour, he added that he would gladly defend artistes such as <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=3">Shatta Wale</a>, <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=4">Kwesi Arthur</a>, <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=5">Black Sherif</a>, <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=6">Stonebwoy</a> and <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=7">Wendy Shay</a>, joking added that if Shatta Wale is stubborn, then he would be an equally stubborn lawyer.</p>



<p>Shedding more light on his music career, Kwaw revealed that his first nickname in school was Montaking. The name “Kwaw Kese” later emerged from his family history, inspired by a relative who was a warrior. Kese, meaning “big”, was added to symbolise strength and presence.</p>



<p>His journey into music was far from glamorous. By his own admission, his first single, “Eye Nonsense” in 2004, was raw and experimental, inspired by heartbreak from his girlfriend, who allowed another man to “peregrinate” her. The track appeared on The Execution Diary, a compilation album by <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=8">Hammer of the Last Two</a>, and it became an instant hit, putting Kwaw Kese on the national radar. He later released his debut solo album, Na Ya Tal, in 2005, firmly establishing himself as a bold, street-rooted voice in Ghanaian hiplife and hip-hop. He credited Dogo for introducing him to Hammer, whom he described not just as a producer but as a director who values quality over speed. According to Kwaw, no matter how much you pay Hammer, if you do not sound good on the beat, you simply will not record.</p>



<p>On politics, Kwaw Kese was clear: he belongs to no political party but any political party that wants him, he is ready for business. However, he is open to serving Ghana. When he gains enough financial strength, he plans to enter politics, starting as a Member of Parliament. He believes the country’s future depends on young people actively participating in governance, pointing out that many creatives are already making meaningful contributions in politics.</p>



<p>One of the most painful moments of his life remains the murder of his close friend and manager, <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=9">Fennec Okyere</a>. Kwaw recalled being in the shower when Fennec’s houseboy called with the devastating news. He rushed to the scene and found his friend lying in a pool of blood. They had been together just a day earlier, planning future projects. The shock and trauma, he said, deeply affected both his career and personality. He does not believe the murder was a robbery, insisting it was a contract killing since nothing was stolen from the house. Although he was detained for questioning, he remains disturbed by the lack of closure and official communication from the police.</p>



<p>Addressing his controversial arrest in Kumasi, Kwaw clarified that it had nothing to do with public smoking, contrary to popular belief. He later learned that the arresting officer was allegedly acting out of jealousy, as his wife was a die-hard fan of the musician. What began as a joke quickly escalated into an arrest.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Kwaw Kese revealed that he has released a single from his upcoming album From Far, which he hopes to officially drop in May.</p>



<p>Despite fame, controversy, loss and personal evolution, Kwaw Kese remains grounded in one enduring truth: purpose outlives pain. And for him, the journey from far is far from over.</p>

<p>Investigations have linked two of the suspects to the killing of three people at Breme near Bechem in the Bono Region in March 2025. Authorities say efforts are ongoing to track down other accomplices and recover additional weapons.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Chairman of the Interim Advisory Council of the Insurance Retirees Forum of Ghana (IRFG), Mr Peter Osei-Duah, has advised young insurance professionals to listen, learn and lead with humility.</p>

<p>The Ghanaian insurance industry, led by Dr Abiba Zakariah, the Commissioner of Insurance (ag.), has taken a decisive step toward preserving institutional memory and strengthening professional standards with the objective to leverage the expertise and experience of veteran insurance practitioners.</p>



<p>The Interim Advisory Council swearing-in ceremony was administered by Mrs Naa Shormeh Gyang (Esq).</p>



<p>During the inauguration, the Commissioner urged council members to uphold and reinforce the ethical and professional “golden rules” that defined their careers, while encouraging retirees to support the council in every possible way.</p>



<p>Members of the interim Advisory Council include retirees Mr Peter Osei-Duah as the Chairman, Mr Ivan Avereyireh, Mr Kofi Ampaw, Dr Francisca Karikari, Mr Bonahopas Arkhurst, and Mr Frank Oppong Yeboah. The rest representing various bodies in the insurance industry are Mrs Jonah (NIC), Mr EMrst Frimpong (Ghana Insurance University) and Mrs Adadey (CIIG).</p>



<p>In his acceptance remarks, Mr PMrr Osei-Duah described the launch as more than a ceremonial event, calling it “a statement of values.”</p>

<p>He emphasised that an industry that forgets its builders risks losing its soul, stressing that the IRFG is not a charity organisation, but an investment in people, professionalism and the long-term stability of the insurance industry.</p>



<p>He commended the NIC, the Chartered Insurance Institute of Ghana (CIIG) and various other industry stakeholders for their vision and urged retirees to see their legacy as an ongoing and not as a destination.</p>



<p>He also challenged young professionals to demonstrate ethical standards and professionalism in their career as the insurance profession is a noble one that hinges on strong integrity.</p>

<p>In her keynote remarks, Dr ADra Zakariah, Commissioner of Insurance (ag.) exp,lained that the initiative aligns with the core developmental agenda of the National Insurance Commission (NIC) in strengthening and growing the insurance industry.</p>



<p>She noted that the gathering was convened to collectively find solutions to industry challenges, reinforce ethics and professionalism, as well as position retirees as mentors to the younger generation of insurance professionals.</p>



<p>She used the occasion to announce plans to establish a structured platform that would harness the knowledge and experience of retired practitioners, integrate them into strategic planning processes, and ensure their expertise continues to shape the future of the sector. </p>



<p>She further revealed plans to establish a fund dedicated to retirees, while also encouraging the renewal of old professional relationships and the building of new ones.</p>



<p>The forum brought together retired insurance professionals, regulators, industry executives, andstakeholders, among others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>‘’Pneumonia strikes like a man-eating shark led by its pilot fish, the common cold’’- Consult your physician.</p>



<p>Many homes across Ghana often blame pneumonia on cold weather, rain, sleeping on bare floors, bathing at night, or sleeping under a fan or air-conditioner. These beliefs transcend generations and are widely accepted as fact. Similar misconceptions exist in many parts of Africa, Asia, and even some Western societies. </p>



<p>However, these ideas are wrong and dangerously so. The continuous spread of myths about its causes encourages harmful self-care practices, delays treatment, and importantly contributes to preventable illness and death among the vulnerable group: The children, elderly, and people with weakened immune system.</p>



<p><strong>Common Myths and Facts</strong></p>



<p>Myth 1: Cold weather causes pneumonia</p>



<p>Cold weather does not cause pneumonia. Germs do.<br>Cold seasons may increase pneumonia because people stay indoors more, live in crowded places, and transmission of such microbes via respiratory droplets is higher during drier and colder months when mucosal secretions are more substantial. Pneumonia cannot develop without bacteria because cold air itself does not infect the lungs.</p>



<p>Myth 2: Sleeping on bare cold floors, a fan or an air-conditioner</p>



<p>There is no medical evidence to the best of our knowledge to support this belief. Infections are not introduced into the lungs by sleeping on cold surfaces or under fans and air-conditioners. At worst, they may worsen discomfort in someone already with respiratory disease. Pneumonia only develops when disease-causing organisms enter the respiratory tract.</p>



<p>Myth 3: Pneumonia affects only children</p>



<p>Pneumonia affects people of all ages. While children under five years are highly vulnerable, older adults and immunocompromised individuals with conditions such as HIV, asthma, diabetes and heart diseases face a high risk of severe illness.</p>



<p>The Real Causes of Pneumonia</p>



<p>The leading cause of pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae, also called pneumococcus. Given the enviable title of the ‘’Captain of the men of death’’ by Sir William Osler in 1918, this iconic gram-positive opportunistic pathogen was recognised as a significant respiratory pathogen soon after its discovery in 1881 and has since remained of interest to the biomedical community for its exceptional ability to colonise and cause diseases in humans.</p>



<p>Pneumococcus is transmitted through the respiratory secretions of infected individuals. In healthy individuals, this bacterium often stays quietly at the back of the nose and throat (nasopharynx/ nasopharyngeal area). Most of the time, it does no harm and causes no symptoms. Problems begin when the bacterium stays there for a long time or when the body&#8217;s defences become weak.</p>



<p>When this happens, it causes non-invasive local infections like sinus infections. In children, pneumococcus can ascend the middle ear through a small passage called the Eustachian tube, a tube that helps drain fluid from the ear. </p>



<p>Younger children have shorter, narrower and more horizontal eustachian tube which makes it harder to drain fluid properly. When fluid builds up, germs grow easily, leading to ear infections (otitis media)<br>When the body’s natural defences in the nasopharynx are weakened, often after viral infections like the flu, pneumococcus can spread deeper into the body.</p>



<p>It may move from the nasopharynx into the lungs, where it causes pneumonia, a serious and sometimes deadly infection. If treatment is delayed, the bacteria can enter the bloodstream and even reach the brain, leading to blood infection and meningitis.</p>



<p> In the United States, this bacterium is responsible for more than half of all bacterial meningitis cases. These severe illnesses are known as invasive pneumococcal diseases. Even when people survive them, they may be left with long-term problems such as reduced lung capacity, memory difficulties, and a higher risk of getting serious infections again. </p>



<p>This is like a glass cup that has cracked: even if it is put back together and can still hold water, it is no longer as strong as it once was. Repeated pneumococcal infections greatly increase the risk of death.</p>



<p>Knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes toward pneumonia and its treatment.</p>



<p>Several cross-sectional studies have been done in Ghana about the knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes towards pneumonia treatment. In Ghana, community knowledge of pneumonia remains low despite its high burden.</p>



<p>Although many caregivers of under-five children recognize symptoms such as fast breathing, chest indrawing, and cough, pneumonia is often misidentified as “malaria” or “a routine childhood illness”, leading to delayed or inappropriate home care. Consequently, care-seeking is suboptimal, with families frequently relying on herbal remedies, over-the-counter medicines, or traditional healers before seeking formal health services[1, 2].</p>



<p>Health-care providers in Ghana widely recognize pneumonia as a major contributor to under-five deaths and hospitalizations, yet compliance with national guidelines for treating community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains inconsistent.</p>



<p> Departures from recommended antibiotic selection and treatment duration are common, driven by factors such as high patient loads, inadequate training, and patient-related challenges including cost, distance to facilities, and past care experiences.</p>



<p> Meanwhile, digital innovations such as mobile-health diagnostic tools for pneumonia (e.g., mPneumonia) are generally perceived as acceptable and up to date by both clinicians and caregivers, particularly when their use is paired with appropriate education and counseling[3, 4]</p>



<p>Globally, we see a similar pattern in many low-to-middle income countries with systematic reviews indicating that about a quarter to one-third of caregivers have good knowledge of pneumonia and its treatment. </p>



<p>Perceptions vary by settings: Pneumonia is feared as a leading killer of children in some communities while it is downplayed as a transient respiratory complaint in others. Attitude towards treatment is generally positive with trusted and accessible healthcare[5, 6]</p>



<p>Current preventive and treatment methods</p>



<p>The knowledge gaps, perception, and attitude gaps accentuate why prevention and early, appropriate treatment are crucial components of pneumonia control. In the United States, there are now three vaccines that help prevent serious infections caused by pneumococcal bacteria. </p>



<p>Two of them are called pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV15 and PCV20), and the third is a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). These vaccines work by using parts of the sugary coating that surrounds the bacteria called the capsule to train the immune system to recognize and fight the germs. </p>



<p>Together, the three vaccines protect against 24 of the more than 100 different types of pneumococcal bacteria (serotypes). PCV15 (Vaxneuvance) and PCV20 (Prevnar20) are made by linking these sugar parts to a harmless form of a diphtheria toxin protein, which helps the body build a stronger and longerlasting immune response (CDC 2021).</p>



<p>On the preventive front in Ghana, PCV’s have become a foundation of national immunization programs, targeting key serotypes, and reducing invasive pneumococcal diseases and pneumonia- related hospitalizations. Despite this win, serotype replacement and emerging non- vaccine types continue to challenge long-term effectiveness.</p>



<p> In Ghana, community awareness off these vaccines remains low among caregivers despite its integration into national immunization programs. Many parents and even some health workers are unfamiliar with what these vaccines do in pneumonia prevention[2, 7] often confusing them with other routine childhood vaccines or perceiving them as optional rather than essential [8]. </p>



<p>This limited awareness contributes to missed opportunities for vaccination, hesitancy, and underutilization of a key preventive tool, even in settings where PCVs are freely available.</p>



<p>For treating pneumonia that spreads in the community especially cases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, doctors often rely on a group of antibiotics called β‑lactams, which include penicillin and cephalosporins. Milder infections are usually treated with pills such as amoxicillin, while more serious cases may require stronger, injected medicines like cefotaxime. </p>



<p>Newer versions of cephalosporins still work well against many strains of S. pneumoniae that have started to resist older penicillin, making them an important option as antibiotic resistance continues to rise.</p>



<p>However, growing resistance is a major concern, since some bacteria can change their cell wall targets or produce enzymes that block β‑lactam activity, making these reliable antibiotics less effective over time[9]. Recent studies also show that shorter treatment courses sometimes just three days can work as well as longer ones in certain patients, helping to limit unnecessary antibiotic use and slow the spread of resistance[10].<br><br>Pneumonia strikes like a maneating shark led by its pilot fish, the common cold” is a clear way of saying that a seemingly harmless illness like a cold can silently pave the way for something far more dangerous. The “pilot fish” (the cold) swims ahead, weakening the body’s defenses and irritating the airways, while the “shark” (pneumonia) follows close behind, ready to take hold when the lungs are most vulnerable.</p>



<p>This image reminds us that what begins as a mild cough or sniffle can, in some people, escalate into a serious lung infection that needs prompt attention. Because pneumonia can hide behind the mask of a simple cold, it is always wise to listen to your body and seek medical advice early especially if symptoms worsen, breathing becomes difficult, or fever persists. Consulting your physician is not an overreaction; it is the best way to ensure that the “shark” never gets a chance to strike.</p>

<p>The Founder and Creative Director of Bullhaus Entertainment, Lawrence Nana Asiamah Hanson, well known as Bullgod, has given a detailed account of what transpired between dancehall artistes Shatta Wale and Stonebwoy at the 2019 Vodafone Ghana Music Awards.</p>



<p>According to Shatta Wale’s former manager, his artiste needed to visit the washroom and meet his father, who was seated in the front row at the time. When he eventually decided to walk there, Stonebwoy was coincidentally announced.</p>



<p>Bullgod narrated the incident during an interview with <em>Roselyn Felli</em> on <strong>Joy Prime’s Changes</strong> show.</p>



<p>“At the time, Shatta was looking for the washroom. That’s what I know and I think at the time they needed to go, that was when Stonebwoy was announced as the Artiste of the Year. If you understand the sitting arrangement at the Dome, you would find it very difficult and again Shatta moves with a storm. He’s not like your regular guy who can sneak and go. Also, at the time, his dad was seated at the front and he was supposed to be seated with his dad. The dad had a dignitary he wanted him to meet but he came with his boys, paid them and sat at the back with them. So when the advert was rolling, he decided to use the washroom and see his dad. I don’t even know if they made their way to the washroom but I’m sure they were heading towards the dad and Stonebwoy and his team were up there,” he explained.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Stonebwoy’s team reacted wrongly, which could have been avoided.</p>



<p>“If you go back and watch the video, Stonebwoy himself was not jittery until when the whole thing started going haywire. That’s when the gun pulling and everything happened.”</p>



<iframe width="1351" height="482" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XjlgSDnh2Ko" title="Bullgod Opens Up About His &#39;Adopt a Prison&#39; Initiative &amp; Time Managing Shatta Wale!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>However, he noted that both artistes have moved on from the incident, as it is now a thing of the past, adding that they are cousins.</p>



<p><strong>Back Story &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Camps of the two rival artistes clashed on stage while Stonebwoy was about to give a speech after winning the coveted Reggae/Dancehall Artiste of the Year at the music awards in 2019.</p>



<p>The brawl started when Shatta Wale (Charles Nii Armah Mensah) walked up to the stage with his multitude of fans while Stonebwoy was about to give a speech for the award.</p>



<p>Although some have said the <strong><em>My Level</em></strong> hitmaker climbed up the stage with his fans to congratulate Stonebwoy for the award, others thought they were there to heckle Stonebwoy.</p>



<p>Stonebwoy, apologised for the brawl when he came back on stage. Shatta Wale on the other hand, later posted on his Twitter handle that the fight on stage was a disgrace to Ghana’s music industry.</p>



<p>The confusion that ensued was witnessed by millions of Ghanaians.</p>



<p>Stonebwoy, known in private life as Livingstone Etse Satekla, also pulled a gun on stage in what some believe he did in self-defence.</p>

<p>The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) says it supports a full‑scale investigation into the brutal killing of Ghanaian traders by the Jama’at Nasr al‑Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM) terrorist group in Titao, northern Burkina Faso.</p>



<p>In an exclusive interview with Joy News’s Blessed Sogah on the sidelines of the ECOWAS Navy Chiefs Summit in Accra, Abdel‑Fatau Musah, ECOWAS Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace and Security, strongly condemned the February 14 attack and stressed the need for accountability.</p>



<p>The attack, which targeted a group of Ghanaian tomato traders travelling through the volatile Sahel corridor, left eight Ghanaians dead and others injured. The victims were ambushed by suspected JNIM militants — an extremist group active across the region — as they carried out routine cross‑border trade between northern Ghana and Burkina Faso. </p>



<p>President John Mahama has been visiting survivors at the 37 Military Hospital in Accra, where injured traders are receiving treatment after being evacuated by the Ghana Armed Forces.</p>



<p>The incident has reignited concern over the safety of Ghanaian nationals engaging in informal regional commerce, particularly along routes where insurgent groups operate with increasing frequency. Cross‑border trade in agricultural products such as tomatoes and onions is a vital livelihood for many northern Ghanaian communities, but has become riskier due to deteriorating security conditions in parts of the Sahel. </p>

<p>President John Mahama, on Thursday, assented to the 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill, 2025, in a brief ceremony before the 13th cabinet meeting.</p>



<p>In his remarks after the signing, the president said, &#8220;Cabinet colleagues, I just appended my signature to give assent to the 24-hour Authority Bill. This Bill, which Ghanaians have been waiting for, was one of our flagship strategies for economic transformation.”</p>



<p>He explained that the process took a while because the government had to ensure due diligence to give legal effect to the policy initiative.</p>

<p>“Now we must move from strategy to implementation. The business sector is waiting, Ghanaian investors are waiting, foreign investors are waiting”, President Mahama added.</p>



<p>&#8220;They want to see the package of incentives that we can afford, so that they can invest more and expand productivity and also create more employment for our young people, and so it&#8217;s my pleasure to assent to this Bill today.&#8221;</p>



<p>The bill establishes a 24-Hour Economy Authority to serve as the central coordinating body to implement the policy, aligning public and private sector efforts, and addressing infrastructure and regulatory needs.</p>



<p>Parliament officially passed the 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill, 2025, a flagship policy of the John Mahama administration.</p>



<p>The Bill was approved on Friday, February 6, after extensive debate between the Majority and Minority caucuses on the floor of the House.</p>



<p>The legislation establishes the 24-Hour Economy Authority to implement the government’s 24-Hour Economy and Accelerated Export Development Programme.</p>



<p>According to the government, the programme is aimed at addressing longstanding structural challenges within Ghana’s productive sector. </p>



<p>It also seeks to reduce the country’s dependence on exporting low-value raw materials and cut reliance on costly imported finished and intermediate goods.</p>



<p>The Authority is expected to drive the integrated and sustainable transformation of national systems for economic production, supply chains, marketing and workforce development.</p>



<p>The Bill, which was laid before Parliament in late 2025, is designed to transition Ghana into a fully operational 24-hour economy. It provides for the creation of a central coordinating body responsible for overseeing and implementing the policy nationwide.</p>



<p>Under the law, the Authority will mobilise investment, coordinate activities between the public and private sectors, and ensure that the necessary infrastructure and regulatory frameworks are in place to support round-the-clock economic activity.</p>



<p>The 24-hour economy policy was one of the National Democratic Congress’ key campaign promises during the 2024 general elections.</p>

<p>The Government of Ghana has intensified efforts to secure justice for the late Nana Agyei Ahyia, the Ghanaian student who tragically lost his life under unusual circumstances while studying in the Republic of Latvia.</p>



<p>In a statement issued on Thursday, 19 February, a delegation led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, recently travelled to Latvia to engage directly with Latvian authorities on the matter.</p>



<p>The delegation comprised forensic experts, a pathologist, legal advisers, the Ghanaian Ambassador, and consular officers from the Ghanaian Embassy in Berlin. The family of the deceased — represented by Nana Agyei’s mother and aunt — was actively involved in the discussions.</p>



<p>Meetings were held with senior Latvian officials, including the Foreign Minister, the Minister for the Interior, police chiefs, state prosecutors, and investigators assigned to the case.</p>

<p>According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Latvian authorities confirmed that the investigation into Nana Agyei’s death is ongoing and is now being directly supervised by the Latvian Interior Ministry. </p>



<p>Fresh investigators have been appointed to guarantee a credible and thorough inquiry, reflecting the high level of interest and concern from the government of Ghana.</p>



<p>The Latvian side welcomed further submissions of relevant information to aid the investigative process. Acting on this, and under the guidance of the Ghanaian delegation, the mother of the deceased submitted a formal statement to the appropriate authorities as part of the official record. </p>



<p>The delegation also indicated that additional submissions would follow.</p>



<p>In response to Ghanaian queries, Latvian officials affirmed that the final investigative report would be made available to Nana Agyei’s family, without objection.</p>



<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasised that the government of Ghana remains fully committed to truth, transparency, and justice.</p>



<p>Officials will maintain regular engagement with Latvian authorities and continue to use all appropriate diplomatic and legal channels to ensure due process is observed and justice is served. Ghanaian officials will also sustain close contact with the bereaved family, providing regular updates to both the family and the public.</p>



<p>The Ministry urged citizens to refrain from speculation, which could undermine ongoing investigations.</p>



<p>“The Government of Ghana remains absolutely committed to safeguarding the welfare and rights of all Ghanaians, both at home and abroad,” the Ministry concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Students’ Representative Council (SRC) of the University of Media, Arts and Communication (UniMAC) has secured a private hostel facility in Osu as part of efforts to address student accommodation challenges and improve welfare on campus.</p>



<p>The SRC General Secretary, Thomas Amankwah Fosuhene, announced the development in a statement dated February 18, 2026, noting that the initiative forms part of the council’s broader commitment to ensuring access to safe and convenient housing options for students.</p>



<p>“The Kouyo-Milady-led UniMAC SRC is pleased to announce that we have successfully secured a private hostel facility in Osu as part of ongoing efforts to address student accommodation challenges,” the statement said.</p>



<p>According to the SRC, the move is aimed at improving student welfare by providing accommodation within close proximity to campus while enhancing comfort and convenience for residents.</p>



<p>The hostel facility will offer several amenities, including air-conditioned rooms, laundry services, and DSTV access. It will also provide flexible accommodation arrangements, allowing between one and six students per room. The facility is located about a 15-minute walk or five-minute drive from campus.</p>



<p>The council explained that details regarding pricing and booking procedures will be communicated in due course, adding that efforts are underway to ensure the facility remains affordable and accessible to many students.</p>



<p>The SRC emphasised that the initiative reflects its commitment to pursuing practical solutions that respond directly to the needs of students and improve the overall academic and campus experience.</p>



<p>Student accommodation remains a recurring concern in many tertiary institutions in Ghana, with growing enrolment often placing pressure on limited on-campus housing facilities. University authorities and student leadership bodies have increasingly explored private-sector partnerships to address the shortfall.</p>



<p>The SRC reaffirmed its commitment to improving student welfare and strengthening support systems across the university community.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Executive Director of the Media Foundation for West Africa (MFWA), Sulemana Braimah, says he is pleased with the dismissal of removal petitions against the Special Prosecutor and officials of the Electoral Commission (EC), describing the outcome as a positive sign for Ghana’s democracy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Executive Director of the Media Foundation for West Africa (MFWA), Sulemana Braimah, says he is pleased with the dismissal of removal petitions against the Special Prosecutor and officials of the Electoral Commission (EC), describing the outcome as a positive sign for Ghana’s democracy.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy FM’s Super Morning Show, Mr Braimah said the decision demonstrates the strength and independence of Ghana’s institutions.</p>



<p>“I think in a democracy, when you find that institutions are independent and strong, I think that is really helpful,” he said.</p>



<p>His comments follow the Chief Justice&#8217;s decision to dismiss petitions seeking the removal of the Special Prosecutor and EC officials, allowing them to remain in office.</p>



<p>Mr Braimah reflected on the political tensions that have surrounded the Electoral Commission in recent years. He noted that during the period when the National Democratic Congress (NDC) was in opposition, the Commission faced heavy criticism.</p>



<p>“We’ve come from a period when, right in the days of the NDC in opposition, the commentary and so on and so forth was absolutely not too good for the Electoral Commission,” he said.</p>



<p>He added that at one point, many EC decisions appeared to align with the position of the then-governing New Patriotic Party (NPP).</p>



<p>“We got to a point where almost every decision of the EC was sort of always in line with what the NPP says their position is,” he stated.</p>



<p>“It got to a point where it was almost like, okay, the EC says this, the NPP says we agree. The NPP says this, and it appears to be the same position as the EC.”</p>



<p>Read also: <a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/mahama-rejects-removal-petitions-after-cj-finds-no-prima-facie-case-against-ec-osp-leadership/">Petitions to remove EC, OSP leadership fail after CJ finds no prima facie case</a>.</p>



<p>According to him, this generated strong concerns from the NDC, although he acknowledged that such reactions are common in partisan politics.</p>



<p>“At all times, the opposition would always be against the EC or speak against the EC’s decision, and we are beginning to see that now,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Braimah argued that the real test of institutional independence comes when due process does not favour the party in power.</p>



<p>“If we’ve gone through all this, and then the party comes to power, and the leadership of the party says these people must go, and then a process is rolled out, in the end, the Chief Justice says, well, nothing has been established, and the people stay in power,” he explained.</p>



<p>He pointed out that the Chief Justice was appointed under the same government, making the ruling even more significant in his view.</p>



<p>“We’re also talking about a Chief Justice who was recently appointed under the same government. For me, it is fulfilling that we have institutions that appear to be independent, strong.”</p>



<p>He also cited a recent Supreme Court ruling on the Kpandai High Court decision as another example of institutions working in accordance with the law rather than political pressure.</p>



<p>“It is not about the wishes of the government in power. It is about what the law says. And it’s about the interpretation of the adjudicating bodies,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Braimah maintained that such developments strengthen Ghana’s democratic system.</p>



<p>“That, for me, is what would make our democracy strong and resilient. And that’s why I’m happy about this decision.”</p>

<p>The Director General of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), COP Lydia Yaako Donkor, has engaged executives of the Nigeria Transport Association in Ghana to bolster collaboration in the fight against human trafficking.</p>



<p>The meeting is part of ongoing efforts by the Ghana Police Service to enhance stakeholder partnerships and preventive measures against crime.</p>



<p>COP Donkor highlighted the crucial role transport operators play in detecting and reporting suspicious activities, noting that traffickers often exploit transport networks to move victims across borders and within the sub-region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The National Anti-Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS) has stopped a bribery attempt by three suspected galamsey operators following the seizure of illegal mining equipment in Bekwai Municipality, Ashanti Region.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, February 18, the task force resumed its anti-galamsey operations, returning to Edwinase and Kokotro, where earlier raids had forced illegal miners to flee.</p>



<p>At Kokotro, the team uncovered a galamsey site dangerously situated within the town, posing risks to lives, property, and the environment.</p>



<p>During the operation, NAIMOS dismantled makeshift structures, destroyed industrial pumping machines, and removed other illegal mining equipment, while seizing a Liugong excavator, two Liugong monitors, and an unregistered motorcycle.</p>



<p>While heading back to their base, the task force was approached by three men, Emmanuel Koblah, Samuel Addai, and Kofi Frimpong, in a black Tundra F150 (registration GR 4743–16), who claimed ownership of the Kokotro site and tried to bribe them with GHC 119,825 to recover the confiscated items.</p>



<p>The trio was promptly arrested after the task force rejected the bribe and handed them over to the Bekwai Police Station for investigation and prosecution. The seized bribe, excavator, monitors, and vehicle are now held at NAIMOS headquarters.</p>



<p>NAIMOS has cautioned illegal miners and their collaborators that bribing officers will lead to swift arrest and prosecution.</p>



<p>The Secretariat also called on local authorities and security agencies to step up monitoring of previously raided sites to prevent the resumption of illegal mining activities.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

<p>The Governor of the Bank of Ghana (BoG) Dr Johnson Asiama has cautioned commercial banks against excessive reliance on net interest income, warning that a changing interest rate environment could test the resilience of earnings across the industry.</p>



<p>Addressing heads of banks in Accra on February 18, 2026, the governor noted that while interest income remains a core component of banking operations, overdependence on it poses risks.</p>



<p>“There is nothing inherently problematic about net interest income. However, a high dependence on it increases sensitivity to interest rate cycles and sovereign exposure dynamics.”</p>



<p>His comments come at a time when Ghana’s monetary conditions are gradually normalising, leading to tighter spreads and declining yields on government securities, traditionally a significant source of bank profitability.</p>



<p>Dr Asiama stressed that as the rate environment stabilises, margins are likely to compress, making it imperative for banks to rethink their revenue strategies.</p>



<p>“As margins compress in a normalizing rate environment, earnings resilience will increasingly depend on diversification, particularly through transactional banking, trade services, payments, treasury activities, and other fee-based income streams that are less balance-sheet intensive.”</p>



<p>The remarks signal a strategic shift in regulatory expectations, with the central bank encouraging institutions to strengthen non-interest income streams and reduce concentration risks tied to sovereign instruments.</p>



<p>The engagement forms part of the central bank’s ongoing supervisory dialogue aimed at strengthening financial stability and ensuring Ghana’s banking sector remains resilient amid evolving macroeconomic conditions.</p>

<p>A 20-year-old seamstress apprentice, Gifty Aba Otuba, died on the spot after she was knocked down by a motorcycle at Gomoa Biakoye on the Kasoa–Winneba Highway.</p>



<p>The accident occurred at Gomoa Biakoye in the Gomoa East District of the Central Region. The deceased was reportedly crossing the highway to deliver smoked fish to chop bar operators before returning to work.</p>



<p>Speaking to Adom News, the deceased’s parents, who are fishmongers, said they had sent their daughter to deliver the smoked fish to customers on the opposite side of the road.</p>



<p>According to them, while she was crossing the busy highway, a motorcyclist travelling from Fetteh Kakraba towards Kasoa knocked her down, and she died instantly.</p>



<p>The rider, who sustained serious injuries, was rushed to St Gregory Hospital, where he is in a coma and receiving treatment.</p>



<p>The body of the deceased has been deposited at the St Gregory Hospital’s morgue by officers from the Awutu Bereku Police Command.</p>



<p>Police are yet to comment officially on the incident.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A Tribute by the Department of Communication Studies, University of Ghana]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong><em>A Tribute by the Department of Communication Studies, University of Ghana</em></strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>For the Department of Communication Studies at the University of Ghana, Dr. Abubakari Sidick Ahmed’s passing is more than the loss of a national media icon. Known as Alhaji, he was a son of the department and a colleague in training.</p>



<p>From the earliest days of Radio Univers, our department played a key role. We provided space, intellectual support, and foundational infrastructure for its launch. What began as a bold academic-media experiment became a key broadcasting training ground in West Africa. Alhaji stood at the heart of that transformation.</p>



<p>His journey from student volunteer reporter to Station Manager mirrors the very philosophy we uphold. Theory must meet practice, and scholarship must serve society. As a proud alumnus of the Department, Alhaji embodied this philosophy with rare conviction. He did not merely manage a station; he extended the classroom.</p>



<p>For decades, Radio Univers became our laboratory, and Alhaji its chief instructor in practice. He opened the airwaves to our students and gave them invaluable real-time experience in journalism and broadcasting. He worked with them patiently. In those moments, he was not just a station manager; he was faculty in action.</p>



<p>As the only professionally trained broadcaster and media scholar at the station for many years, he ensured that our pedagogical objectives were not compromised. He developed and enforced a Code of Conduct that elevated professionalism in reporting, production, and presentation. He demanded discipline not for its own sake, but because he understood that credibility is the currency of journalism.</p>



<p>Under his leadership, the station flourished.</p>



<p>He built people, not just a station.</p>



<p>Today, his protégés fill the newsrooms of TV3, Joy FM, and Citi FM, as well as international platforms such as the BBC, Voice of America, and Deutsche Welle. Distinguished alumni, including Bernard Avle, Bola Ray, Kafui Dey, and Paa Kwesi Asare, have testified to his mentorship and belief in their potential. </p>



<p>Their tributes echo what we, as a department, have always known: Alhaji believed in people and invested in their growth.</p>



<p>But his impact did not end in the newsroom. Through his close collaboration with our department, Alhaji also helped nurture a generation of media and communication academics. Among those who passed through his hands are Dr. Theodora Dame Adjin-Tettey, now a Senior Lecturer of Journalism, Media and Communication Studies at Durban University of Technology in South Africa;&nbsp; and Dr. Kwaku Botwe, a faculty member in our department who now serves as General Manager of Radio Univers, assuming leadership after Alhaji’s retirement. In this, we see a profound truth: great leaders do not merely build institutions; they create reliable succession plans. Alhaji did both.</p>



<p>His introduction of programmes such as <em>Behind the Headlines </em>and <em>Research &amp; Innovation Agenda </em>further demonstrated his commitment to bridging academia and society. He made Univers not just a broadcasting station, but a platform for intellectual engagement and policy dialogue.</p>



<p>He championed Ghanaian music and languages at a time when Western content dominated the airwaves. And his pioneering newspaper review programme earned national recognition, a format that would later define morning broadcasting nationwide.</p>



<p>His service was recognized with the Vice-Chancellor’s Distinguished Service Award and the National Award of the Order of the Volta. Yet, for us, his greatest honour was the integrity with which he represented the department and the university in the public sphere.</p>



<p>Today, as we mourn, we also give thanks. Radio Univers stands stronger because he guarded its vision. Our graduates stand taller because he strengthened their confidence. Our department’s mission of training ethical, skilled communicators found in him a faithful partner.</p>



<p>Alhaji has signed off from this earthly frequency, but his signal remains strong in every newsroom, every studio, and every classroom shaped by his influence.</p>



<p>There will never be another Alhaji.</p>



<p>And as his department, we are proud to have called him our own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Deputy National Communications Director of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Kamal-Deen Abdulai, has called for a psychological evaluation of the suspect accused of stealing a child, stressing that such assessments should be part of the ongoing investigations.</p>



<p>His remarks come after a recent incident at Mamprobi Hospital, where a woman, allegedly disguised as a nurse, reportedly took a newborn from the postnatal ward, sparking widespread public concern.</p>



<p>Speaking on the <em>Joy News AM Show</em> on Thursday, February 19, Mr Abdulai said that while the law clearly punishes child stealing, authorities must also consider the mental and emotional state of the accused.</p>



<p>“Our laws frown on it. Section 93 of the Criminal Offences Act is clear on child stealing. Of course, even this kind of offence can be tried under abduction and kidnapping as well,” he said, emphasising the seriousness of the crime.</p>



<p>However, Mr Abdulai argued that beyond legal provisions, investigators should examine the suspect’s psychological background, especially in cases involving women who may be struggling with infertility.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_0hbg2o2mc?si=wxsqMqYNlouCx1lK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“But that said, in our social settings, women who find it very difficult to conceive go through a lot. That is why they also need to conduct some psychological, if you like, research on the person who is purported to have, who is alleged to have, stolen the child. What is she going through? What actually triggered it? All these things ought to be looked at,” he said.</p>



<p>Drawing comparisons with practices in more developed jurisdictions, he added, &#8220;Advanced countries, they would not just, you know, go straight to punishing, even though the act is there. They would investigate to know her status, what warranted this, and what the actual intent was. All this will be established before maybe the final docket is presented for an offence to be charged.”</p>



<p>Mr Abdulai acknowledged the intense societal pressure some women face when they are unable to conceive. “I say this because most women go through some of these problems. I am married, I don&#8217;t have a child, and the entire family is on you, off the map.”</p>



<p>Nonetheless, he was firm that such pressures cannot justify criminal conduct. “Do you have to steal a baby? No, you don&#8217;t have to at all. It&#8217;s not. That&#8217;s why I say the laws harm women adequately. It&#8217;s wrong. It&#8217;s not a proper act. It&#8217;s an immoral act.</p>



<p>“But you see, people go through a lot as well. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying. That said, it doesn&#8217;t justify what has happened,” he concluded.</p>
