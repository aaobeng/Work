										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University in the United States, Prof William Kwasi Peprah, has urged Ghana to use the current surge in gold prices to protect the economy against future shocks.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, Prof Peprah said Ghana must take advantage of what he described as a windfall and set up a dedicated gold stabilisation fund to cushion the country when prices fall.</p>



<p>“So now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold, to put in that money to guard against… that will come in,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah described the Gold Board concept as a good idea but warned that, for it to work effectively, it must be backed by a clear stabilisation account, similar to those already in place for cocoa and petroleum.</p>



<p>“So the gold board idea is very good. However… the one that exists is a cocoa one, and we also have one for petroleum. If the gold board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold,” he stressed.</p>



<p>He explained that gold prices are rising due to global uncertainty and investor behaviour. He said gold is traded based on three main angles: fear, inflation, and currency hedging.</p>



<p>“One, when there is fear… and then a currency hedge… we currently have fear, so many things happening in the world, which makes investors uncertain. So that is why we are seeing the gold price really, really moving up,” he said.</p>



<p>He also pointed to currency pressures as another driver of the current rally.</p>



<p>“We’ve noticed that the US dollar is devaluing, and that’s why we see investors moving into gold,” he added.</p>



<p>While he acknowledged that gold has historically risen over time, he cautioned that prices can still fall and Ghana must prepare for that possibility.</p>



<p>“The law is good, the operationalisation is where we must watch it carefully and make sure that… the price… will still start to come down,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said the stabilisation fund should be designed to support the gold industry and the broader economy when gold prices eventually decline.</p>



<p>“My advice… is that whatever amount of gold sales that is coming that we are putting in our balance of payment account, and we create that fund just for gold, and then to make sure that when the price starts to drop, we’ll be able to use it support the gold industry in Ghana,” he said.</p>



<p>He also raised concerns about how the Gold Board will be financed, warning that weak financing could create future challenges.</p>



<p>“The financing model for the gold board also needs to be looked at a little bit,” he said.</p>



<p>He noted that the Gold Board has relied on government funding, but those releases have been inconsistent.</p>



<p>“It has raised, getting money from the government of Ghana, which we know the amount they promised was not fully released in 2025,” he said.</p>



<p>He added that with the Bank of Ghana set to exit financing the gold trade, the Gold Board must carefully review the alternative model provided in the law.</p>



<p>“In the law, it allows them to take money in advance from whoever needs gold, and then be able to give them the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah warned that without the right structure, the Gold Board could risk becoming another troubled commodity institution.</p>



<p>“So that gold board does not tend to the next Coco board,” he cautioned.</p>



<p>He concluded that Ghana must avoid overdependence on gold in the absence of a robust buffer, particularly given the volatility of other commodities.</p>



<p>“If we feel on gold… our trade balance will move into a very struggling position,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University in the US has urged Ghana to urgently establish a Gold Stabilisation Fund to protect the economy against future shocks from falling gold prices.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, Prof. William Kwasi Peprah said Ghana’s new Gold Board framework is a good idea but warned that, without a dedicated stabilisation account, the country could face serious difficulties when the current price boom cools.</p>



<p>“The gold board idea is very good,” he said, adding that if the structure is to succeed, Ghana must take lessons from existing commodity stabilisation models. </p>



<p>“As I talked about the commodity stabilisation account… the one that exists is a cocoa one, and we also have one for petroleum. Exactly. If the gold board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold.”</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah explained that gold prices are being driven up by global uncertainty and investor behaviour, and that Ghana should not assume that high prices will persist. </p>



<p>He noted that gold is traded globally from three key perspectives: fear, inflation, and currency hedging.</p>



<p>“We currently have fear… so many things happening in the world which makes investors uncertain,” he said, arguing that this uncertainty is driving gold prices sharply upward. </p>



<p>He also linked the trend to inflation expectations and currency movements. “We’ve noticed that the US dollar is devaluing, and that’s why we see investors moving into gold.”</p>



<p>While he described Ghana’s law on the Gold Board as sound, he cautioned that the real test lies in implementation. </p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSCZdNE0E_o?si=adO3gewCnJNKrb8T" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“To me, the law is good; the operationalisation is where we must watch it carefully,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah said the current period should be treated as a rare opportunity to save and prepare. </p>



<p>“So now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold, to put in that money to guard against… that will come in.”</p>



<p>He advised that proceeds from gold sales should be used not only for immediate balance-of-payments support but also for future stability. </p>



<p>“Whatever amount of gold sales that is coming that we are putting in our balance of payment account, and we create that fund just for gold,” he said, explaining that the fund would help Ghana support the industry and the economy when prices fall.</p>



<p>He also welcomed efforts to add value locally. “It’s good. We are doing a refinery to add on value,” he said, but insisted that a stabilisation fund remains essential.</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah further raised concerns about the Gold Boardis financing, warning that it must not become another struggling commodity institution. “The financing model for the gold board also needs to be looked at a little bit,” he said.</p>



<p>He noted that the Gold Board has relied on government support, but that the promised funds have not been fully disbursed. </p>



<p>“It has raised, getting money from the government of Ghana, which we know the amount they promised were not fully released in 2025,” he said.</p>



<p>He also noted that the Bank of Ghana is expected to exit financing for the gold trade, making it urgent for the Gold Board to adopt sustainable funding options. </p>



<p>“Bank of Ghana is going to exit from financing the gold trade,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah suggested that the law already provides an alternative approach. “It allows them to take money in advance from whoever needs gold, and then be able to give them the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>He stressed that Ghana must not confuse a revolving fund with a stabilisation fund. </p>



<p>“Gold board, they have a revolving fund. Revolving fund account is not the same as stabilisation fund account,” he said.</p>



<p>He warned that if Ghana fails to plan now, the country could be exposed when prices eventually decline. “If we fail on gold… our trade balance will move into a very struggling position,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An associate professor of Finance at Andrews University in the U.S. has endorsed the Gold Board initiative but warned that the country must prepare for a possible downturn in global gold prices.</p>



<p>Prof Willian Kwasi Peprah, speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, said, “So the gold board idea is very good.” </p>



<p>However, he stressed that the policy&#8217;s success will depend on how it is operationalised and on whether Ghana builds buffers to manage future shocks.</p>



<p>He pointed to the country’s existing commodity stabilisation accounts for cocoa and petroleum and argued that gold must not be left out.</p>



<p>“If the gold board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah explained that while gold prices have been rising, history shows that such price movements are not permanent, and Ghana must plan for a decline.</p>



<p>“We know from history, gold price… has always been going up… [but] we must watch it carefully and make sure that… the price… will still start to come down,” he said.</p>



<p>He said that gold trading is driven primarily by three factors: fear, inflation, and currency hedging.</p>



<p>“We currently have fear… so many things happening in the world, which makes investors uncertain. So that is why we are seeing the gold price really, really moving up,” he said.</p>

<p>On inflation, he noted that “The IMF and World Bank projects are being a little bit moderate.” He added that currency movements are also prompting investors to allocate to gold.</p>



<p>“We’ve noticed that the US dollar is devaluing, and that’s why we see investors moving into gold,” he explained.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said Ghana must treat the current high prices as a windfall and save part of the proceeds.</p>



<p>“So now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold, to put in that money to guard against… that will come in,” he said.</p>



<p>He advised the Gold Board, the Bank of Ghana and government to create a dedicated fund from gold sales.</p>



<p>“My advice to probably the gold board, the central bank and the government is that whatever amount of gold sales that is coming… we create that fund just for gold,” he said.</p>



<p>He stated that the purpose is to ensure that Ghana can support the gold industry when prices fall.</p>



<p>“When the price starts to drop, we’ll be able to use it support the gold industry in Ghana,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah welcomed efforts to refine gold locally to add value, but insisted a stabilisation fund remains necessary.</p>



<p>“It’s good. We are doing a refinery to add value, but that commodity fund for gold is needed,” he said.</p>



<p>He also raised concerns about the Gold Board&#8217;s financing structure, noting that it must be carefully examined to avoid future problems.</p>



<p>“The financing model for the gold board also needs to be looked at a little bit,” he said.</p>



<p>He noted that the Gold Board has relied on government funding, but “the amount they promised was not fully released in 2025.” </p>



<p>Prof Peprah also stated that the Bank of Ghana is expected to exit financing for the gold trade.</p>



<p>He cited a legal precedent that permits the Gold Board to accept payments in advance from buyers.</p>



<p>“It allows them to take money in advance from whoever needs gold, and then be able to give them the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah warned that the financing model must be properly structured so that the Gold Board does not become “the next Coco board.”</p>



<p>He added that Ghana’s trade position could weaken if the country becomes too dependent on gold without a buffer.</p>



<p>“If we fail on gold… our trade balance will move into a very struggling position,” he cautioned.</p>

<p>An Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University in the U.S. has endorsed Ghana’s Gold Board concept but warned that poor implementation and weak financing could turn it into “the next COCOBOD.”</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, Prof. Willian Kwasi Peprah said the idea behind the Gold Board is “very good,” but stressed that the real risk lies in its operationalisation.</p>



<p>“To me, the law is good. The operationalisation is where we must watch it carefully,” he said, arguing that Ghana must not repeat past institutional mistakes.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said a key gap in the Gold Board framework is the absence of a dedicated commodity stabilisation account for gold. </p>



<p>He noted that Ghana already has stabilisation accounts for cocoa and petroleum, and gold must not be treated differently, especially given how global prices can swing.</p>



<p>“If the Gold Board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>He explained that gold prices are currently enjoying a windfall, driven by global uncertainty, inflation fears and currency hedging. According to him, gold trading is shaped by three main factors: fear, inflation, and currency.</p>

<p>However, he warned that Ghana must not assume prices will remain high indefinitely. He said the country must use the current gains to prepare for the inevitable downturn.</p>



<p>“Now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said the proposed fund should be built from gold sales and used to protect the industry and the economy when prices begin to fall.</p>



<p>“My advice… is that whatever amount of gold sales that is coming… we create that fund just for gold,” he said. “When the price starts to drop, we’ll be able to use it [to] support the gold industry in Ghana.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> Ivory Coast is considering cutting the price it pays farmers for cocoa beans to align with <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ghana-cuts-farmgate-cocoa-price-introduces-new-financing-model-2026-02-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghana&#8217;s</a>, two government sources told Reuters, as the world&#8217;s two largest</span> producers of the chocolate ingredient face a major <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/cocoa-stocks-main-harvest-pile-up-ivory-coast-warehouses-2026-02-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crisis</a>.</p>



<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Senior Ivory Coast officials said all options were on the table as the government debates whether to follow Ghana, which has already cut its farmgate price by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ghana-cuts-farmgate-cocoa-price-introduces-new-financing-model-2026-02-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28.6% for the rest</a> of the 2025/2026 season&#8217;s</span> main crop, in coordination with Abidjan, as it adjusts to plunging prices.</p>



<p>The farmgate price, set at the start of the harvest season, is the amount of money farmers receive for their product after harvest and before any intermediaries, exporters, processors, traders, or cooperatives add value.</p>



<p>The discussions with Ghana and within the Ivorian government on cutting the price to align with Ghana have not previously been reported.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Ivory Coast–Ghana Cocoa Initiative (ICCIG) said the two African countries, which together account for about 60% of global output, had been coordinating closely since the onset of the sector crisis.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have put all options on the table, and discussions are progressing well. Courageous and realistic decisions will be taken soon,&#8221; the first Ivory Coast official said, requesting anonymity because they are not authorised to speak on the issue.</p>



<p>The second official said the continued price fall, which has seen cocoa drop by nearly 50% in recent months, left the government with little room to manoeuvre.</p>



<p>Cocoa futures on the ICE exchange fell to their lowest level in 2-1/2 years on Tuesday, as concerns about unsold cocoa stocks in the Ivory Coast and Ghana continued to weigh on prices.</p>



<p>&#8220;We must think about the survival of the cocoa sector in the Ivory Coast. We need to act; changes are underway,&#8221; the source said, declining to disclose further details.</p>



<p>An inter-ministerial committee has met over the issue, and a decision could come soon, the two sources said.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the Ivory Coast government did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">MEASURES TO PREVENT STRUCTURAL DAMAGE</h2>



<p>Alex Assanvo, ICCIG&#8217;s executive secretary, said the two countries were adapting to the sudden market reversal and had taken measures to prevent structural damage.</p>



<p>He said the trading rooms of the Ivory Coast&#8217;s Coffee and Cocoa Council and Ghana&#8217;s COCOBOD remained in regular contact.</p>



<p>Assanvo also defended the Living Income Differential, introduced in 2019 to boost farmers&#8217; earnings, noting that recent market volatility underscores its relevance.</p>



<p>ICCIG is preparing a meeting between the two countries to strengthen coordination amid financial pressures on farmers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The organisation remains mobilised to coordinate policies in both countries,&#8221; Assanvo said, adding that all players in the sector would be convened to review market developments and propose improvements to price-stabilisation mechanisms.</p>



<p>Exporters and buyers expect the Ivory Coast to announce a cut soon, saying the question is no longer if but when.</p>



<p>&#8220;The country is resisting, but for how long? I don&#8217;t see Ivory Coast doing something different from Ghana,&#8221; said the head of an Abidjan-based export company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A Cape Coast Circuit Court has remanded into Police custody Patrick Nii Torto, a man accused of using the Office of the Vice President to swindle people with the ploy of securing them Canadian visas and work permits.</p>



<p>Torto allegedly scammed his victims out of GH¢5,325 and GH¢8,200, posing as a Vice Presidential staffer and captain in the Ghana Armed Forces.</p>



<p>Operating under the name Dr Patrick Nelson Ayittey, Torto also made his victims believe that he had affiliations with the Canadian Embassy in Ghana, the police told the court on Tuesday.</p>



<p>He pleaded not guilty to the charge of defrauding by false pretences, but the court, presided over by Madam Nana Aba Quiaba Nunoo, remanded him into police custody to assist in further investigations.</p>



<p>Torto was arrested from his hideout at Abura by the police in Cape Coast following a complaint filed against him at the Abura police Station on Monday, February 16.</p>



<p>According to the Police, the accused person scammed his victims between December 2025 and January 2026 and failed to refund their monies despite repeated demands.</p>



<p>The Police conducted a search at his residence and found about 10 Ghanaian passports and other documents, including school certificates, birth certificates, and Ghana Cards.</p>



<p>Further enquiries also revealed that the suspect was neither an officer of the Ghana Armed Forces or a worker at the Vice President’s Office and had no affiliations with the Canadian Embassy.</p>



<p>The Police also gathered that Torto was not a medical doctor or doctorate degree holder.</p>



<p>He is expected to reappear before the court on Tuesday, March 03, 2026.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A mobile money vendor has appeared before the Dansoman Circuit Court, accused of stealing GH¢112,660 from her employer. </p>



<p>Juliana Addy, 29, pleaded not guilty to the charge of stealing. </p>



<p> The court granted her bail in the sum of GH¢20,000 with two sureties and directed her to deposit copies of her Ghana Card with the Court Registry and report to the Police every two weeks. </p>



<p>&nbsp;It also directed the prosecution to file disclosures and witness statements for the Case Management Conference and adjourned the matter to March 25, 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p> The prosecution said the complainant, Esther Fosuah Cobbinah, is an entrepreneur who owns a company with a branch at the Last Stop in Dansoman, Accra. </p>



<p>&nbsp;It said Addy, employed in January 2024, was assigned to operate&nbsp;Cobbinah’s&nbsp;mobile money shop and supervise other employees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;The prosecution explained that Addy continued in that role until June 25, 2025, when&nbsp;Cobbinah&nbsp;travelled to the USA for six months, and left her in charge of one of the shops and its stock.&nbsp;</p>



<p> It said upon Cobbinah’s return in December 2025, a routine audit revealed discrepancies, and a joint annual audit on January 2, 2026, showed that Addy could not account for GH¢104,300. </p>



<p> Addy reportedly told the police she used the money to pay her father’s medical bills and her brother’s tuition fees, and to spend the remainder. </p>



<p> The prosecution said that Addy was arrested on January 6, 2026, after Cobbinah lodged a formal complaint at the Dansoman Police Station, and that Cobbinah admitted to the offence during police interrogation. </p>



<p>It said investigations also revealed that Addy had used the company’s mobile money merchant numbers to secure online loans of GH¢5,225 and GH¢3,135 from a loan firm without Cobbinah’s knowledge. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Accra Circuit Court has remanded eleven persons into police custody for alleged involvement in land guard activities at&nbsp;Akokofoto, Dansoman, Accra.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The accused are Kamal Yussif alias Biker,&nbsp;Asafoatse&nbsp;Abass Seidu, Jacob Lartey alias Lartey Kwei,&nbsp;Adoku&nbsp;Samuel alias&nbsp;Asafoatse, Mohammed Issah alias Galadima, Emmanuel Nii Acquah alias&nbsp;Asafoatse, Iddrisu Akaya Chum, John&nbsp;Afade, Teiko Ofori and Emmanuel&nbsp;Gyemfi&nbsp;Nkrumah.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They have been charged with conspiracy to commit a crime, engaging in land guard activities and resisting arrest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The prosecution told the court that the accused resisted arrest, during which Kamal Yussif allegedly punched Chief Inspector Isaac&nbsp;Mbilla&nbsp;on the mouth, injuring his teeth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The accused pleaded not guilty and are expected to reappear before the court on February 28, 2026.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Defence counsel prayed for bail, but the prosecution, led by Chief Inspector Jonas Lawer, opposed the application, citing ongoing investigations. </p>



<p>Prosecution said the complainants, Madam Sarah&nbsp;Forkuo, Managing Director of&nbsp;Osamanpa&nbsp;Estate Developers, and&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;John Agyepong, both of East Legon, had secured a Supreme Court judgement placing the disputed land in their possession.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It said on February 16, 2026, the accused allegedly invaded the land with sticks,&nbsp;cutlasses&nbsp;and guns, preventing the complainants and their workers from developing the property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A distress call was made to the Police Headquarters, and officers dispatched to the scene arrested the accused, who resisted but were eventually overpowered and taken to the Regional Police Headquarters for further investigations.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The US presidential jet is getting a new paint design that will include one of President Donald Trump&#8217;s preferred colour choices for the White House and his hotels, gold.</p>



<p>Air Force One and other aircraft used by high-level US officials, including First Lady Melania Trump, are being repainted in gold, deep red, and navy blue while undergoing scheduled repairs and maintenance, according to the US Air Force.</p>



<p>The colours will also feature on a new Boeing 747-8i luxury aircraft donated to the presidential fleet by Qatar, an Air Force spokesperson told CBS.</p>



<p>The white, blue, and robin&#8217;s-egg blue associated with the presidential jet have been in use since the 1960s, when John F. Kennedy was president.</p>



<p>Trump has called for updates to the executive fleet since his first term. His successor, former President Joe Biden, cancelled a broad makeover Trump had initially planned.</p>



<p>The new colours have already been spotted on model aircraft seen at the White House, where Trump is also making his aesthetic imprint, from the large-scale plans for a new ballroom to the more subtle installation of gold signs in a curling font.</p>



<p>The private plane Trump travelled on during his 2024 campaign, sometimes called &#8220;Trump Force One&#8221;, used the same colour palette as the presidential fleet.</p>



<p>While it is not clear how much the paint jobs will cost, the US Air Force, which operates the executive planes, said in a statement to the BBC that the new colour requirements were &#8220;not expected to result in additional delays or costs to the program.&#8221;</p>



<p>It added that it was implementing the new colour scheme on the Boeing VC-25B (a variant of the Boeing 747) currently used to transport the president, as well as on four C-32 jets often used as &#8220;Air Force Two&#8221; for the vice president, and on the jet donated by Qatar. Painting has been completed on one of the C-32 aircraft.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cc68/live/44f4bae0-0cd6-11f1-b054-335fa224f76a.jpg.webp" alt="AFP via Getty Images Air Force One lands in Tokyo, Japan  in October 2025" style="width:840px;height:auto" title="Air Force One set for makeover paint job with new colours"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Air Force One in its current colours</figcaption></figure>



<p>Preparations began last summer for the Pentagon to refit the Qatari jumbo jet that is expected to serve as Air Force One. The Boeing aircraft &#8211; valued at $400m (£300m) &#8211; was donated by Qatar as an &#8220;unconditional&#8221; gift, with any necessary retrofitting costs being borne by the US government.</p>



<p>While any plane where the president is a passenger is called &#8220;Air Force One&#8221;, the holder of the highest office in the country most often flies on a specialised jet that includes an office, a bedroom suite, two kitchen galleys that can prepare 100 meals, office space and a medical facility, according to Boeing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bodo/Glimt&#8217;s fairytale continues as they added Inter Milan to their list of prized scalps to put them within touching distance of a place in the Champions League last 16.</p>



<p>Bodo are still in their off-season in Norway, yet they overpowered Inter in the second half after beating Manchester City and Atletico Madrid last month.</p>



<p>Jens Petter Hauge and Kapser Waarts Hogh struck inside three second-half minutes after Francesco Pio Esposito had cancelled out Sondre Fet&#8217;s opener.</p>



<p>Inter may be eight points clear at the top of Serie A and have been Champions League finalists in two of the last three seasons, but they were made to look ordinary by Bodo in the Arctic Circle.</p>



<p>Bodo took the lead after 20 minutes on their artificial surface when Hogh backheeled the ball for Fet to finish expertly.</p>



<p>Inter responded and former Manchester United defender Matteo Darmian hit the post before Nicolo Barella shot straight at Bodo goalkeeper Nikita Haikin.</p>



<p>Inter&#8217;s pressure paid off and when Carlos Augusto&#8217;s header from Barella&#8217;s cross was blocked, the ball fell to Esposito who turned and fired home.</p>



<p>The visitors and three-time winners were denied by the woodwork again when Lautaro Martinez hit the post before Inter goalkeeper Yann Sommer touched Hogh&#8217;s drive over.</p>



<p>Inter did not heed this warning, and Bodo retook the lead on 61 minutes when they countered, and Hogh teed up Hauge on the left to power home a left-footed drive into the top corner.</p>



<p>Inter were stunned, and Bodo took full advantage to score a third when Ole Didrik Blomberg squared the ball for Hogh to tap home.</p>

<p>The Ga Mantse, King Tackie Teiko Tsuru II, is in stable condition following a road accident in the early hours of Wednesday morning.</p>



<p>The incident occurred at about 2:00am at Pai-Katanga in the Oti Region while the King was returning to Accra from Tamale.</p>



<p>Sources close to the palace indicate that he had travelled to the Northern Region on a private visit at the invitation of the Yaa Naa.</p>



<p>The visit, described as cordial and significant, formed part of ongoing engagements between traditional authorities aimed at strengthening bonds of unity and mutual respect among Ghana’s revered institutions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="561" src="http://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ga-Mantse-HRM-King-Tackie-Teiko-Tsuru-II-B.jpg" alt="Ga Mantse Nii Teiko Tsuru II" class="wp-image-10032327260" title="Ga Mantse stable after early morning accident" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ga-Mantse-HRM-King-Tackie-Teiko-Tsuru-II-B.jpg 800w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ga-Mantse-HRM-King-Tackie-Teiko-Tsuru-II-B-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ga-Mantse-HRM-King-Tackie-Teiko-Tsuru-II-B-768x539.jpg 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ga-Mantse-HRM-King-Tackie-Teiko-Tsuru-II-B-428x300.jpg 428w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ga-Mantse-HRM-King-Tackie-Teiko-Tsuru-II-B-200x140.jpg 200w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ga-Mantse-HRM-King-Tackie-Teiko-Tsuru-II-B-150x105.jpg 150w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ga-Mantse-HRM-King-Tackie-Teiko-Tsuru-II-B-214x150.jpg 214w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ga-Mantse-HRM-King-Tackie-Teiko-Tsuru-II-B-605x424.jpg 605w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ga-Mantse-HRM-King-Tackie-Teiko-Tsuru-II-B-330x231.jpg 330w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ga-Mantse-HRM-King-Tackie-Teiko-Tsuru-II-B-340x238.jpg 340w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Ga-Mantse-HRM-King-Tackie-Teiko-Tsuru-II-B-55x39.jpg 55w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ga Mantse Nii Teiko Tsuru II</figcaption></figure>



<p>On his return journey to Accra, however, the Ga Mantse’s vehicle was involved in an accident. Fortunately, he escaped unhurt and is reported to be in stable condition.</p>



<p>Personnel of the Ghana Police Service were said to have responded swiftly and timely when they were called to the scene.</p>



<p>While the circumstances surrounding the accident are yet to be fully detailed, the overall mood at the palace is one of relief and thanksgiving, as the Ga Mantse continues to recover and remains in good spirits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Leaders Arsenal blew a 2-0 lead in dramatic fashion to draw at rock-bottom Wolves and missed the chance to go seven points clear at the top of the Premier League.</p>



<p>Gunners defender Riccardo Calafiori turned in debutant Tom Edozie&#8217;s shot in the fourth minute of added time for a late leveller after goalkeeper David Raya and centre-back Gabriel made a mess of clearing a high ball into the box.</p>



<p>Hugo Bueno had started Wolves&#8217; comeback with a stunning curling effort after Bukayo Saka, with his first goal in 15 games, and Piero Hincapie gave Arsenal what seemed a commanding lead.</p>



<p>The Gunners had control at Molineux as Bukayo Saka<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c4gje501g51o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;celebrated his new contract with the fifth-minute opener.</a></p>



<p>The England forward nodded in Declan Rice&#8217;s cross &#8211; just a day after signing a fresh five-year deal at the Emirates &#8211; before Hincapie added a 56th-minute second with a smart finish from a Gabriel pass for his first goal for the club.</p>



<p>Yet after Saka &#8211; who ended a 15-game goal drought in all competitions &#8211; went off following treatment, Arsenal struggled under pressure as Hugo Bueno pulled a goal back with a stunning curler in the 61st minute.</p>



<p>Wolves pushed at the end, and when Gabriel got in the way as Raya tried to clear a cross, 19-year-old Edozie, on for his senior debut as a substitute, slammed in a shot that struck Calafiori and went in off the post.</p>



<p>Arsenal were stunned, with tempers frayed at the end after Gabriel Jesus shoved over Yerson Mosquera, as their lead over Manchester City is five points, with Pep Guardiola&#8217;s side having a game in hand.</p>



<p>It was a damaging night for Mikel Arteta&#8217;s men in their quest for a first league title since 2004.</p>



<p>Yet they still remain in the hunt for a quadruple of trophies, also facing City in next month&#8217;s Carabao Cup final, entering the Champions League last 16 (having topped the league phase), and in the FA Cup fifth round.</p>



<p>But this result will once more spark doubts over Arsenal&#8217;s staying power, having finished second in the past three successive seasons.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Wolves-analysis-Strugglers-going-down-fighting-">Wolves analysis: Strugglers going down fighting</h2>



<p>Despite being adrift at the bottom and 17 points from safety, Wolves are still fighting and will still have a say in how this Premier League season finishes.</p>



<p>With an hour gone it was a very different scenario as Arsenal led 2-0 and looked on course to see out a comfortable victory.</p>



<p>But that is when Wolves relaxed and began to play, Hugo Bueno scoring the goal of the game with a cracking effort.</p>



<p>Edozie&#8217;s dream leveller &#8211; a first appearance in senior football marked by a first goal even if Calafiori played his part &#8211; epitomised Wolves&#8217; spirit.</p>



<p>That is all they had left &#8211; and had to find &#8211; under Rob Edwards, with the salvage operation already bleak when he replaced Vitor Pereira in November.</p>



<p>They sensed an Arsenal collapse and scrapped their way to a point &#8211; something that was denied them at Emirates Stadium back in December when Mosquera&#8217;s 90th-minute own goal gave the Gunners a 2-1 success.</p>



<p>This point will matter to boss Edwards, the players and the Molineux faithful.</p>



<p>It has been a fractured place for a long time during the first half of an unhappy season.</p>



<p>Unity has returned recently and refusing to give up against the leaders with a gutsy display will hearten Wolves as they prepare for life in the Championship and build for a Premier League return at the first attempt.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Arsenal-analysis-Pressure-mounts-on-Gunners-yet-again">Arsenal analysis: Pressure mounts on Gunners yet again</h2>



<p>By <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/topics/cp99zjx9mv1t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Howell</a></strong>, Football reporter</p>



<p>Arsenal&#8217;s lacklustre performance at Wolves has only heightened the nerves of supporters hoping to see them end their title drought.</p>



<p>Despite leading through Saka&#8217;s close-range header &#8211; his first goal since December &#8211; they lacked flow in attack.</p>



<p>Boss Arteta had again picked Saka in the number 10 role rather than the wing after an impressive performance in the FA Cup win over Wigan &#8211; and it looked as though that decision had the desired effect to get his side&#8217;s frontline firing.</p>



<p>However, despite getting a second goal from Hincapie, Arsenal did not do enough, nor did they look comfortable enough to deny the battling hosts.</p>



<p>This was meant to be a routine win against the league&#8217;s bottom club &#8211; one they had beaten nine successive times since 2021 and scored against for a 37th time on the trot in all competitions.</p>



<p>Raya didn&#8217;t have a save to make in the first half, but Arsenal did not dominate as they should and paid the price.</p>



<p>With games against London rivals Tottenham and Chelsea to follow, the Gunners find themselves under a cloud of uncertainty and whether their title dream will turn into another nightmare.</p>



<p>A trip to second-placed Manchester City will be one of their remaining 11 games and Arteta and his squad will have to finally show they can deal with the pressure in the title run-in.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Whats-next-for-these-teams">What&#8217;s next for these teams?</h2>



<p>Rob Edwards takes his Wolves side to Crystal Palace on Sunday, 22 February (14:00 GMT), before hosting Aston Villa on Friday, 27 February (20:00 GMT).</p>



<p>The north London derby at Tottenham awaits Arsenal on Sunday, 22 February (16:30 GMT) and then Chelsea visit the Emirates on Sunday, 1 March (16:30 GMT).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Club Brugge scored a dramatic late equaliser as they twice fought back against Atletico Madrid to leave their Champions League knockout phase play-off tie delicately poised.</p>



<p>The hosts, who trailed 2-0 at the interval to a Julian Alvarez penalty and Ademola Lookman&#8217;s goal, rallied after the break with Raphael Onyedika and Nicolo Tresoldi drawing them level.</p>



<p>Joel Ordonez&#8217;s own goal threatened to undo their efforts until Christos Tzolis drove in an 89th-minute equaliser to round off a see-saw contest.</p>



<p>The visitors had made the perfect start, with Alvarez converting from the spot after home full-back Joaquin Seys mistimed a defensive clearance and was penalised for handling in his own box.</p>



<p>When Lookman bundled in on his European debut for Atletico moments before the interval, against a Club Brugge side he faced while an Atalanta player in September, Diego Simeone&#8217;s side looked on course for a comfortable victory.</p>



<p>However, Nigeria international Onyedika prodded in just after the restart to bring the hosts back into the contest.</p>



<p>And when the impressive Tresoldi levelled on the hour mark, getting across his marker to steer the ball past away goalkeeper Jan Oblak, they looked favourites to complete a remarkable turnaround.</p>



<p>It was certainly no more than Club Brugge deserved with Onyedika twice going close in the first period, when Atletico were guilty of sitting back after going a goal ahead.</p>



<p>Simeone, who had watched his side thrash Barcelona then disappoint in a 3-0 defeat by Rayo Vallecano, looked far from amused in his technical area but the introduction of Alexander Sorloth helped shift the momentum back towards his team.</p>



<p>The Norway international hit the woodwork within four minutes of replacing Antoine Griezmann and went close with another effort before pressuring Ordonez to turn into this own net.</p>



<p>Club Brugge were not to be denied though, with Greek international Tzolis rescuing a draw with an unerring finish.</p>



<p>The return leg takes place in Madrid on Tuesday, 24 February (20:00 GMT), with the winners facing Liverpool or Tottenham in the last 16.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Benfica claim there is a &#8220;defamation campaign&#8221; against Gianluca Prestianni after Uefa launched an investigation into claims he racially abused Real Madrid winger Vinicius Jr.</p>



<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Tuesday&#8217;s Champions League tie at Benfica was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cpv843x1zgzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">halted for 10 minutes</a> after Vinicius reported alleged racist abuse to referee Francois Letexier, and he and his teammates left the field.</span></p>



<p>Brazil international Vinicius, who has been a victim of numerous incidents of racist abuse during his playing career, later said in a post on Instagram: &#8220;Racists are, above all, cowards.&#8221;</p>



<p>Prestianni, who could face a minimum 10-match ban from European competition if found guilty, denied directing racial abuse at Vinicius.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Benfica defended Prestianni in a post on their official X account, along with a video of the alleged incident, saying: &#8220;Given the distance, the Real Madrid players could not have heard what they claim to have heard.&#8221;</p>



<p>The club added they &#8220;fully support&#8221; and believe the version of events presented by Prestianni.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Prestianni&#8217;s] conduct in the service of the club has always been guided by respect for opponents, institutions and the principles that define Benfica&#8217;s identity,&#8221; Benfica added.</p>



<p>&#8220;The club regrets the defamation campaign of which the player has been a victim.&#8221;</p>



<p>Benfica manager Jose Mourinho has been criticised for comments he made after the match, including saying Vinicius had been disrespectful in his goal celebration.</p>



<p>Former referee Mark Clattenburg, who was a pundit for the match on Amazon Prime, apologised on Wednesday for his &#8220;clumsy&#8221; comments on the incident.</p>



<p>Clattenburg said Vinicius had &#8220;not helped himself&#8221; and made things difficult for the referee.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing justifies racism in sport or in life. I&#8217;m grateful to have a chance to follow up on last night. I got it wrong, I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; the 50-year-old <a href="https://x.com/clattenburg1975/status/2024173363187368123">posted on X., external</a></p>



<p>&#8220;It was live TV, my job is to respond to the moment, and the words I used were clumsy and not right.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m already learning from this and appreciate my colleagues who covered the situation with class throughout.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Discrimination-is-one-thing-gaslighting-is-another-the-reaction">&#8216;Discrimination is one thing, gaslighting is another&#8217; &#8211; the reaction</h2>



<p>Mourinho said in his post-match interview that he had been told different things by Vinicius and Prestianni regarding the incident.</p>



<p>The Portuguese, who managed Real for 178 games between 2010 and 2013, pointed to their legendary striker Eusebio as proof that Benfica is not a racist club.</p>



<p>&#8220;The club reaffirms, clearly and unequivocally, its historical and unwavering commitment to defending the values of equality, respect and inclusion, which are in line with the core values of its foundation and have Eusebio as their greatest symbol,&#8221; Benfica said.</p>



<p>Mourinho&#8217;s and Benfica&#8217;s comments have been criticised by several people, including anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out.</p>



<p>Kick It Out chair Sanjay Bhandari said both the club and manager had &#8220;failed&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a natural inclination to want to believe your player, but the reality is they didn&#8217;t hear it,&#8221; Bhandari told BBC Sport.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only two people who are in that conversation and two people who could have heard what was said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think the better reaction from a club with Benfica&#8217;s fantastic stature would be to say we&#8217;re going to cooperate with the investigation.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is quite typical after these kinds of discriminatory events. The discrimination is one thing, the gaslighting is another.&#8221;</p>



<p>FIFA president Gianni Infantino said he was &#8220;shocked and saddened&#8221; by the incident and commended Letexier for activating the anti-racism protocol.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is absolutely no room for racism in our sport and in society &#8211; we need all the relevant stakeholders to take action and hold those responsible to account,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will always continue to reiterate: No to racism, no to any form of discrimination!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz remain on course to meet in the Qatar Open final after both claimed straight-set wins on Wednesday.</p>



<p>World number two Sinner beat Australia&#8217;s Alexei Popyrin 6-3 7-5 to reach the quarter-finals in Doha, before Alcaraz won 6-2 7-5 against France&#8217;s Valentin Royer.</p>



<p>The pair met in six finals last year, three of them at Grand Slams, with world number one Alcaraz winning the French and US Opens.</p>



<p>The 22-year-old Spaniard will next face Karen Khachanov, who beat Marton Fucsovics 6-2 4-6 6-4.</p>



<p>Sixth seed Jakub Mensik breezed past Zhang Zhizhen 6-3 6-2 to set up a last-eight meeting with Sinner, who has now reached at least the quarter-finals in 28 of his past 30 tournaments, stretching back to the 2023 ATP Finals in Turin.</p>



<p>The 24-year-old Italian, who lifted last year&#8217;s Australian Open and Wimbledon titles, has now won 22 of his past 23 matches. His only defeat came against Novak Djokovic in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/clyn9l0zvnpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Open semi-finals last month.</a></p>



<p>Meanwhile, Greece&#8217;s Stefanos Tsitsipas upset world number 11 Daniil Medvedev 6-3 6-4 in Doha to book a clash with fifth seed Andrey Rublev, who beat Fabian Marozsan 6-2 6-4.</p>



<p>The unseeded Frenchman Arthur Fils and Czech Jiri Lehecka, seeded eighth, complete the quarter-final line-up having also claimed comfortable victories.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Phillipe Coutinho says he is leaving boyhood club Vasco da Gama because he is &#8220;tired mentally&#8221; and his &#8220;cycle at the club has ended&#8221;.</p>



<p>The former Liverpool and Barcelona midfielder was substituted at half-time after being booed by fans during Vasco&#8217;s win on penalties over Volta Redonda last week.</p>



<p>Coutinho, who has 68 caps for Brazil, did not return to the bench in the second half to watch the remainder of the game.</p>



<p>In a lengthy, emotional statement on Instagram, the 33-year-old says he is leaving Vasco because &#8220;now is the time to take step back&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would never disrespect the fans, my team-mates and Vasco. I&#8217;ve never done that anywhere I&#8217;ve been. Those who know me know that,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;At that moment, on the way to the locker room, I felt and realised that my cycle at the club had ended, and I didn&#8217;t come back to prioritise my mental health.</p>



<p>&#8220;It hurts a lot. The truth is that I&#8217;m very tired mentally. With a tight heart, I understand that now is the time to take a step back and end this cycle in Vasco.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m grateful for everything I&#8217;ve lived here. I&#8217;ll take Vasco with me forever. In the chest. In history. In life.&#8221;</p>



<p>Vasco have not confirmed Coutinho&#8217;s departure, but BBC Sport have reached out for comment.</p>



<p>Coutinho has played 81 times and scored 17 goals for Vasco since rejoining for a second stint in 2024.</p>



<p>He started his career at Vasco, then joined Inter Milan and later moved to Liverpool in 2013.</p>



<p>He scored 54 goals in 201 games for the Reds before joining Barcelona for £142m in 2018.</p>



<p>He later had stints at Bayern Munich, Aston Villa and Al-Duhail before returning to Vasco.</p>



<p>&#8220;I chose to go back to Vasco because I love this club. I love everything that Vasco represents in my life,&#8221; added Coutinho.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wearing this shirt was one of the most important choices I&#8217;ve ever made. And, in every training session, in every game, I gave my best. Always!&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghanaian track and field athlete Doris Quainoo delivered a standout performance at the Jarvis City Invite (also known as the Jarvis Scott Invitational) in Lubbock, Texas, over the weekend of February 13-14, 2026, showcasing her steady improvement and competitive spirit in the women’s 60m hurdles.</p>



<p>Representing the University of South Florida (USF) Bulls, the junior from Gomoa Dawurampong, Ghana, progressed impressively through each round of the event. <br></p>



<p>In the preliminaries, Quainoo placed ninth with a time of 8.55 seconds. She bounced back strongly in the semifinals, securing third place and clocking 8.31 seconds, a clear step forward. </p>



<p>The final proved to be her breakthrough moment; Quainoo surged to second place overall, crossing the line in a new personal best of 8.23 seconds.</p>



<p>The consistent drops in her times highlighted her ability to build momentum under pressure and refine her technique mid-competition.</p>



<p>Quainoo’s achievement added a bright spot to an already strong showing for the USF track and field program, which set three new program records and claimed multiple podium finishes across the two-day meet.</p>



<p>On the men’s side, Markel Jones dominated the 60m hurdles, winning the final in 7.67 seconds after strong prelim (7.77) and semi (7.71) runs. Nathan Metelus broke the program record in the 200m with 20.66 seconds (finishing second overall), while Karim Belmahdi set a new mark in the 800m at 1:49.6. <br></p>



<p>The men’s 4x400m relay team, featuring Devontie Archer, Metelus, Alexavier Monfries, and Jones, stormed to first place and another program record with 3:03.82.</p>



<p>Other notable results included Mercy Angaamchaab’s second-place finish in the women’s 800m (2:10.24), and solid contributions across sprints, field events, and relays that underscored the Bulls’ depth and rising form this indoor season.</p>



<p>The performance comes amid USF’s recent success, including back-to-back American Athletic Conference Indoor Championships in 2024 and 2025, plus the 2024 AAC Outdoor title. The program has produced numerous All-Americans and continues to build under head coach Erik Jenkins.</p>



<p>For Quainoo, a hurdles specialist who has represented Ghana internationally and previously competed at the collegiate level before transferring to USF, this PB in the 60m hurdles marks another step in her development as she balances academic pursuits with elite athletics.</p>



<p>The Bulls now turn their attention to the Tampa Classic on February 21 to kick off the outdoor season, followed by the American Indoor Championships from February 26-28 in Birmingham, Alabama. With momentum like this, USF and Quainoo, look poised for more breakthroughs ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Spanish police have arrested a 20-year-old man suspected of hacking a hotel booking website and reserving luxury rooms priced at up to €1,000 ($1,180; £870) per night for just one euro cent.</p>



<p>He was detained at a Madrid hotel, where he was accused of incurring charges totalling more than €20,000 across several stays.</p>



<p>Police said the alleged crime involved altering the payment validation system and was the first of its kind to be detected.</p>



<p>Their investigation began after a travel booking site reported suspicious activity. It took just four days to complete &#8211; the Spanish outlet ABC reported that the suspect used his real identity to make the reservations.</p>



<p>According to police, the suspect is believed to have sabotaged the payment system via a cyberattack, causing the system to authorise his transaction after entering only 1 cent as the charged amount.</p>



<p>Police said the transaction initially appeared to have been carried out correctly. The irregularity was only discovered when the payment platform transferred the actual amount &#8211; €0.01 &#8211; to the hotel company.</p>



<p>Four days later, police located the suspect at the Madrid hotel and arrested him. His most recent stay there was for four nights and typically cost €4,000.</p>



<p>They said the man had also consumed mini-bar items during his stays and left other bills unpaid.</p>



<p>The police statement suggests that bookings had been made at other hotels, though no details were provided.</p>



<p>ABC reported that the suspect had previously been arrested in the Canary Islands, where he had also stayed at a luxury hotel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Instagram-owner Meta Platforms, appeared in a California court on Wednesday defending his leadership of the company in a landmark legal case over whether social media is addictive for children.</p>



<p>It is Zuckerberg&#8217;s first appearance before a jury after years of backlash against Meta, which also owns WhatsApp and Facebook, which he co-founded.</p>



<p>Meta&#8217;s lawyers have argued that the lead plaintiff in this case, known by her initials K.G.M., was harmed by other factors in her life, not by her use of Instagram.</p>



<p>The trial, in which Google&#8217;s YouTube is also a defendant, is being closely watched for its implications for thousands of similar lawsuits facing social media firms.</p>



<p>TikTok and Snapchat, which had also been named in the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24g8v6qr1mo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settled</a> shortly before the trial was scheduled to begin. Terms of the settlements were not disclosed.</p>



<p>Lawyers for K.G.M. or Kaley, who started using Instagram and YouTube as a child, have accused social media firms of working to addict young users, despite being aware of risks to mental health.</p>



<p>She attended the proceedings on Wednesday, sitting directly across from Zuckerberg, who arrived at court with an entourage of security and associates.</p>



<p>Bereaved parents were also among those in the courtroom to watch the proceedings.</p>



<p>Mark Lanier, representing K.G.M., pressed Zuckerberg about his efforts to get users to spend more time on his platforms, confronting the executive with emails he had written.</p>



<p>In 2015, for example, Zuckerberg told a group of executives that his goals for the year included seeing &#8220;time spent increase by 12%&#8221; and the &#8220;teen trend be reversed.&#8221;</p>



<p>A year earlier, he had identified time spent as &#8220;the most concerning&#8221; metric being tracked by the company.</p>



<p>Gesturing to his client, Lanier noted that the emails were written when she was only nine or 10 years old, and already using Instagram.</p>



<p>Zuckerberg admitted that &#8220;at an earlier point in the company&#8221; he would give executives goals to increase time spent, while also insisting that was no longer how the company operated.</p>



<p>He also said that if something is of value, &#8220;people tend to use it more.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lanier noted that people who are addicted to something also tend to increase their use.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to say to that,&#8221; Zuckerberg replied. &#8220;I think that may be true, but I don&#8217;t know if that applies here.&#8221;</p>



<p>In questioning last week, Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, challenged the idea of social media addiction, arguing that even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn71mgmzljlo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16-hours of Instagram use</a>&nbsp;in a single day did not show an addiction.</p>



<p>The trial is expected to last several weeks. It is also set to include testimony from former Meta employees who have since spoken out about the company&#8217;s practices.</p>



<p>YouTube boss Neal Mohan was also expected to appear but is no longer being called to testify, the BBC has learned.</p>



<p>The case is one of thousands of similar lawsuits brought by families, state prosecutors, and school districts that are currently winding their way through U.S. courts.</p>



<p>The lawsuits accuse Meta and other social media platforms, including TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube, of functioning in an addictive manner that ultimately has harmed many children.</p>



<p>In one such case, 29 state attorneys general are urging a California federal court to order the platforms to make several changes immediately, before any trial, including requiring Meta to remove all accounts known to belong to users under 13 years of age.</p>



<p>A growing number of countries are restricting social media use among young people. Australia implemented a ban on social media accounts for people under 16 late last year.</p>



<p>The UK, Denmark, France and Spain are considering similar measures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At least 33 miners have died in a suspected carbon-monoxide leak at a lead and zinc mine in central Nigeria&#8217;s Plateau state, witnesses have told the BBC.</p>



<p>The tragedy is believed to have occurred just before sunrise at a site outside the town of Wase, operated by the mining company Solid Unity Nigeria Ltd.</p>



<p>Toxic gas is believed to have built up underground in poorly ventilated tunnels, causing the workers to collapse just before the end of their night shift.</p>



<p>They were discovered by those reporting for work in the morning; more than 20 other miners were rescued and rushed to the hospital for treatment.</p>



<p>Security personnel have sealed off the mine, about 200km (124 miles) south-east of the state capital, Jos, as investigations begin to determine the cause of the leak.</p>



<p>State officials are yet to visit the area, and response efforts have reportedly been slow because of security concerns &#8211; armed criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, have been active there in recent years.</p>



<p>Safiyanu Haruna, one of the miners who found the bodies at the start of his shift, told the BBC that some of the miners who were underground survived and were taken to a hospital in Wase for treatment.</p>



<p>According to Haruna, the incident occurred at around 06:30 local time (05:30 GMT), killing 37 miners.</p>



<p>He said the miners had just finished their early-morning Muslim prayers and had returned underground to finish their shift.</p>



<p>The Plateau state government has issued a statement saying that, according to its preliminary investigation, 33 miners were killed in a blast at the mine &#8211; but workers at the scene say this is not the case.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was carbon-monoxide gas that leaked and killed them,&#8221; Haruna said.</p>



<p>&#8220;There was no rescue for them at the time because those who were coming for the morning shift had yet to arrive,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is sad to lose 37 miners who were struggling to make ends meet. We&#8217;re disturbed by the incident.&#8221;</p>



<p>The victims, believed to be men aged between 20 and 40, were buried shortly afterwards in accordance with local tradition, another local resident told the BBC.</p>



<p>The news has devastated the mainly Muslim community.</p>



<p>Mining disasters occur relatively frequently in Nigeria.</p>



<p>Less than two years ago, dozens of gold miners died after being trapped underground when a pit collapsed in neighbouring Niger state.</p>



<p>Officials believe the incident was caused by torrential rains that softened the soil.</p>



<p>The tragedy is likely to renew concerns over safety standards in Nigeria&#8217;s mining sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the First Lady has expressed relief following the safe recovery of the baby stolen from the Mamprobi Polyclinic and her successful reunion with her biological mother and family.</p>



<p>In a statement, the First Lady commended the Ghana Police Service for a swift and professional response that led to the arrest of the suspect and the safe return of the baby.</p>



<p>The statement also struck a strong cautionary note, acknowledging the emotional struggles of women and families dealing with conception challenges, but warning that such difficulties must never be allowed to justify criminal actions.</p>



<p>“While we empathise deeply with women and families facing challenges with conception, desperation must never be allowed to lead to such unconscionable acts,” the statement said.</p>



<p>The Office further urged medical facilities and maternity homes nationwide to strengthen security measures to better protect mothers and newborns.</p>



<p>It emphasised that the safety of mothers and babies must be prioritised, especially in healthcare settings where families expect the highest level of protection.</p>



<p>“The safety of every mother and child must be paramount,” the statement added.</p>



<p>The First Lady’s Office also encouraged individuals who genuinely wish to build families through adoption to follow the legal process by engaging accredited adoption agencies and adhering to the required procedures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During high-level engagements with Nigerian traditional leaders, civil society organisations, and development partners, the president of the Ford Foundation, Heather Gerken, applauded the foundation’s long-standing commitment to advancing democracy, human rights, and social justice in West Africa.</p>



<p>The engagements were part of Gerken’s official first visit to Nigeria, during which she participated in a conference that convened more than 180 traditional and community leaders from across Africa working to advance solutions to gender-based violence and community engagement. </p>



<p>Gerken also met with several grantees working on climate justice issues, including Spaces for Change, Health of Mother Earth Foundation, Socio- Economic Rights and Accountability Project, Africa Climate Foundation, Africa Centre for Energy Policy, BudGIT Foundation, Centre for Research and Action on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights and Sustainable Energy for All, who discussed the need for equitable energy access, accountable governance and strengthening civil society to deliver sustainable development outcomes.</p>



<p>The visit also featured a dinner hosted by Ford Foundation Board member, Gbenga Oyebode, and attended by distinguished Nigerians, including His Royal Majesty Igwe Alfred Nnaemeka Achebe, Dr Muhammadu Sanusi II, former Governor of Ekiti State Dr Kayode Fayemi, former First Lady of Ekiti State Erelu Bisi Fayemi, and Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, Chairman of Access Holdings, alongside leaders from civil society and  Heads of Foundations.</p>



<p>Speaking at the dinner, Gerken thanked hosts and guests for the warm reception, describing the gathering as a reflection of Nigeria’s leadership and civic strength.</p>



<p>“When I saw the list of people here tonight, I was struck by the depth of wisdom and experience in this room,” she said. </p>



<p>“These are voices shaping how Nigeria and the world think about justice, democracy, and development.”</p>



<p>Gerken noted that her visit was especially meaningful, as the Foundation has maintained an unbroken partnership with Nigeria for 65 years. </p>



<p>“Coming to Nigeria matters enormously. Our relationship with this country has been one of the most important in the history of the Ford Foundation.”</p>



<p>She also praised the Ford Foundation’s Office of West Africa team and its leadership under Dr ChiChi Aniagolu‑Okoye, Regional Director, for strengthening the Foundation’s impact in the region.</p>



<p>“At critical moments in history, the Ford Foundation has stood up for justice and democratic values, even under pressure,” Gerken said.</p>



<p>She commended the Foundation’s board for continuing to support work that defends democracy, the rule of law, and human rights worldwide, despite increasing global challenges.</p>



<p>Gerken concluded by thanking guests for their insights and hospitality, calling her conversations in Nigeria deeply energising. “From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I will be coming back very soon,” she said.</p>



<p>Also speaking at the dinner, the 16th Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II, commended the Ford Foundation for its sustained support to Nigeria, noting that its interventions are helping to ease social and economic hardships in local communities.</p>



<p>“Nigeria is proud of Ford and grateful for what the Foundation is doing,” he said. “In the past, social challenges in many local areas were reflected in troubling data. Today, because of these interventions, those numbers are beginning to fall.”</p>



<p>While acknowledging Nigeria’s challenges, Sanusi said the country remains a land of opportunity due to its population, natural resources, and long-term potential.</p>



<p>Drawing on his experience as a traditional ruler, he said that living closely with communities had given him a firsthand understanding of their struggles.</p>



<p>“That is why I value the Ford Foundation’s efforts to reach people at the grassroots and improve their lives,” he said.</p>



<p>Sanusi also warned that global funding cuts have real human consequences.</p>



<p>“Every time a dollar is cut, it is a human being that is affected — through lost nutrition, health care, maternal and child services, education, and security,” he said.</p>



<p>He commended the Foundation for maintaining its support despite shrinking global resources and appealed for continued engagement.</p>



<p>“This is a period of darkness, but we will see the light if people like you continue to shine a torch into the grey areas,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thousands of students flooded the Athletic Oval of the University of Ghana (UG) on Valentine’s Day as Telecel Ghana’s TurnUp delivered the biggest campus party to climax Akwaaba Week for freshers.</p>



<p>Headlined by top music stars Black Sherif, Kweku Smoke, and Kidi, the campus blast also featured a surprise international performance by acclaimed Jamaican dancehall artist Popcaan.</p>



<p>The night officially opened with Afrofusion duo Lali X Lola, who set the pace for the evening with an energetic performance.</p>



<p>Shortly after, the five UG students shortlisted for the Telecel Next TurnUp Star challenge took turns competing for the GH¢10,000 grand prize across the music and dance categories. </p>



<p>The competition, which saw dozens of entries on Instagram and TikTok, gave student performers the opportunity to share the spotlight with the headline acts and compete for prize money before thousands of their peers. </p>



<p>The crowd cheered and adjudged Kelalie and Pentop winners of the music and dance categories, respectively.</p>



<p>“It feels amazing to win the Telecel Next TurnUp Star challenge, and I’m thankful to all who pushed and supported me,” said Kelalie, the music category winner and third-year Public Administration and Information Studies major. </p>



<p>“As a recording artiste and student, this is the best opportunity to put myself out there and show other students the talent I have.”</p>



<p>Afropop singer, KiDi, leaned into the Valentine’s theme with a set built around his popular love songs, drawing sing-alongs and concluding his performance by gifting flower bouquets to two female fans.</p>



<p>The energy shifted from romance to ‘hustle anthems’ when Kweku Smoke emerged. The Agyekum hitmaker’s high-energy performance resonated strongly with Gen Z, many of whom recited the lyrics to his songs word for word.</p>



<p>The defining moment of the night came during Black Sherif’s performance. Dressed in an all-pink suit and matching cap, the award-winning artist lit up the audience as they sang along every word from his hit music catalogue. </p>



<p>Performing songs from both of his chart-topping albums, Black Sherif paused mid-set to introduce the biggest surprise of the night, Popcaan.</p>



<p>The pair performed their collaboration “Celebrate,” which prompted one of the loudest reactions of the evening and shifted the event from a campus party to an international showcase.</p>



<p>Throughout the night, active students on Telecel School SIM received prizes and gifts from Telecel and its brand partners, with MC Kojo Manuel announcing winners between performances.</p>



<p>Several students walked away with high-value devices and home appliances, including an iPhone 17, a Hotwav Cyber 16 Pro, rice cookers, blenders, a fridge, a laptop and dinner tickets. Others also won freebies from Indomie, Coca-Cola, Minimie, Bel Aqua, Didi Shito and Close Up.</p>



<p>Telecel TurnUp extended beyond the main stage. A two-day Telecel Cashless Bazaar enabled students to purchase food and clothing using Telecel Cash, while Telecel Service Clinics on campus handled SIM registrations and assisted with SIM-related issues.</p>



<p>Director of Enterprise Business and Wholesale, Tawa Bolarin, said TurnUp is an appreciation of the telecom operator’s partnership with university communities.</p>



<p>“Telecel TurnUp is about celebrating the loyalty of thousands of students who rely on the network through our tertiary bundles. </p>



<p>&#8220;We are proud to have created this moment at UG, and we look forward to taking the TurnUp experience to even more campuses across the country,” Ms Bolarin said. </p>



<p>“If your university is on the Telecel tertiary package, it could host the next TurnUp.”</p>



<p>Since its launch in 2021, Telecel TurnUp has become a recurring fixture on Ghana’s campus entertainment calendar, with previous editions held at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, and the University of Energy and Natural Resources, Sunyani.</p>



<p>Third-year Political Science and English student, Theresa, said her expectations were exceeded. “I have been at Legon for three years, and I have never seen this kind of turnout. When Blacko brought out Popcaan, the whole place just exploded. I also liked that it wasn’t only about the big artistes. It felt like Telecel really came for the students.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Rescue teams combing through the backcountry of California&#8217;s Lake Tahoe region say they have found the bodies of eight skiers who went missing in an avalanche on Tuesday.</p>



<p>The search for a final missing skier continues, but that person is presumed dead, Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said at a news conference on Wednesday.</p>



<p>Officials said one of the deceased was the spouse of someone on one of the search-and-rescue teams, making continued rescue efforts &#8220;challenging emotionally&#8221;.</p>



<p>Fifteen skiers were reported missing on Tuesday after a &#8220;football-field&#8221; sized avalanche came barreling down in the Castle Peak area around 11:30 PST (19:30 GMT). Six have been rescued.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to offer my condolences to the family in this very trying time,&#8221; Placer County Sheriff Wayne Woo said on Wednesday.</p>



<p>The bodies of the eight dead skiers are still trapped in the snow and can&#8217;t yet be recovered due to &#8220;pretty horrific&#8221; conditions, officials said.</p>



<p>Since the avalanche, another 3ft (.9m) of snow has fallen on the area, Tahoe National Forest supervisor Chris Feutrier said.</p>



<p>&#8220;The hazard remains high,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Once the bodies are recovered, they will be transported to the Placer County morgue.</p>



<p>Families of the deceased have been notified. Authorities have not yet released any of their names.</p>



<p>Sheriff Woo said the rescue operation was a joint effort involving two teams and roughly 50 crew members who had to traverse &#8220;extreme weather conditions&#8221; using specialised equipment.</p>



<p>At 17:30 local time on Tuesday, search teams arrived to an area roughly two miles (3.2km) from where survivors were sheltering in make-shift tents, and had to ski in from there.</p>



<p>Two of the six survivors had to be carried back and &#8220;could not walk because of the injuries they sustained during the avalanche&#8221;, Sheriff Moon said. They were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.</p>



<p>Among the survivors, one was a guide and five were clients of the Blackbird Mountain guided tour.</p>



<p>The entire ski group consisted of a mix of 11 recreational skiers and four ski guides.</p>



<p>The avalanche on Tuesday occurred as they were making their way back at the end of a three-day trip.</p>



<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom&#8217;s office said in a post on X that state authorities were &#8220;co-ordinating an all-hands search-and-rescue effort&#8221; with local emergency teams.</p>



<p>Conditions on Wednesday remained dangerous, multiple officials said, with Woo describing the climate as &#8220;treacherous&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Avoid the back country,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Please allow us to focus all of our resources on continuing to recover these bodies for the family and bring them home.&#8221;</p>



<p>The avalanche that trapped the skiers was rated as a D2.5 on a scale of D1 to D5, Sierra Avalanche Center Forecaster Steve Reynaud told local outlet ABC News 10.</p>



<p>The Boreal Mountain Ski Resort, which is near where the accident occurred, has reported over 30in (76cm) of snowfall since Tuesday.</p>



<p>The resort decided to close on Tuesday because of high winds and low visibility.</p>



<p>The storm has also closed several highways, including Interstate 80 and Highway 50.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;Do not give away Diego Garcia,&#8221; US President Donald Trump has said as he criticised the UK&#8217;s plan to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back an important military base.</p>



<p>Trump said &#8220;this land should not be taken away from the UK&#8221; and if it did it would be &#8220;a blight on our Great Ally&#8221;, in a post on social media.</p>



<p>This comes despite&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgrz2v98z0ro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Washington on Tuesday giving its official backing</a>&nbsp;to London&#8217;s plan to cede sovereignty of the British Indian Ocean Territory to Mauritius.</p>



<p>In response to Trump, the UK Foreign Office said the Chagos Islands deal was &#8220;crucial to the security of the UK and our key allies, and to keeping the British people safe&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;The agreement we have reached is the only way to guarantee the long-term future of this vital military base,&#8221; it said in a statement.</p>



<p>Trump&#8217;s latest comments come ahead of talks between the US and Mauritius planned for next week.</p>



<p>Diego Garcia is the largest island in the archipelago, and is used as a joint military base by the UK and US armed forces.</p>



<p>Under the deal<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">,<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9dqg3nqynlo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> announced last May,</a> the UK will lease back Diego Garcia for </span>99 years.</p>



<p>Posting on the Truth Social platform on Wednesday, Trump wrote: &#8220;I have been telling Prime Minister Keir Starmer, of the United Kingdom, that Leases are no good when it comes to Countries, and that he is making a big mistake by entering a 100 Year Lease&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The US president stressed that Diego Garcia was &#8220;strategically located in the Indian Ocean&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Prime Minister Starmer is losing control of this important Island by claims of entities never known of before,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;We will always be ready, willing, and able to fight for the U.K., but they have to remain strong in the face of Wokeism, and other problems put before them.&#8221;</p>



<p>And referring to ongoing US-Iran talks on Tehran&#8217;s controversial nuclear programme, Trump said: &#8220;Should Iran decide not to make a Deal, it may be necessary for the United States to use Diego Garcia&#8230; in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous Regime.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Republican president has repeatedly threatened to use military action against Iran over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests and its nuclear activities.</p>



<p>The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.</p>



<p>Asked by the BBC about Trump&#8217;s latest comments, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: &#8220;The post should be taken as the policy of the Trump administration, it&#8217;s coming straight from the horse&#8217;s mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;When you see it on Truth Social, you know it&#8217;s directly from President Trump; that&#8217;s the beauty of this president in his transparency and relaying this administration&#8217;s policies.&#8221;</p>



<p><br>But on Tuesday,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgrz2v98z0ro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the US Department of State gave its official backing to the planned handover&nbsp;</a>of the Chagos Islands.</p>



<p>In a statement, it said it &#8220;supports the decision of the United Kingdom to proceed with its agreement with Mauritius concerning the Chagos archipelago&#8221;.</p>



<p>Trump&#8217;s position on the issue has seen rapid U-turns in recent months &#8211; from describing the planned transfer as an &#8220;act of great stupidity&#8221; to saying the deal was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yx1wedww2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the &#8220;best&#8221; the prime minister could make.</a></p>



<p>Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said Trump&#8217;s latest comments was &#8220;an utter humiliation&#8221; for Starmer.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time Starmer finally saw sense, U-turned and scrapped this appalling deal altogether,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump&#8217;s latest change in position showed that the UK needed to pursue closer ties with Europe.</p>



<p>&#8220;Trump&#8217;s endless flip-flopping on the Chagos Islands shows why Starmer&#8217;s approach is doomed to fail,&#8221; Davey wrote in a post on X.</p>



<p>&#8220;Britain can&#8217;t rely on the US while Trump is in the White House. It&#8217;s time to strengthen our ties with allies we can depend on, starting with our neighbours in Europe.&#8221;</p>



<p>Last month, Reform leader Nigel Farage &#8211; an outspoken critic of the UK handover plan &#8211; praised Trump&#8217;s earlier criticism of London&#8217;s handling of the issue.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank goodness Trump has vetoed the surrender of the Chagos islands,&#8221; Farage wrote on X.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, four Chagos islanders &#8211; who are opposing the handover deal &#8211; landed on the Chagos Islands&#8217; remote atoll as part of a protest against the deal.</p>



<p>They refused to leave it, despite a threat of eviction by a British maritime patrol.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Former Defence Minister and Bimbilla MP Dominic Nitiwul has criticised President John Mahama over what he describes as a gap in Ghana’s security leadership</p>



<p>He warned that the continued absence of a substantive Defence Minister is exposing weaknesses in the country’s security architecture.</p>



<p>His comments follow the recent terrorist attack on Ghanaian tomato traders in Burkina Faso, an incident he says requires urgent, high-level intervention from the Defence Ministry.</p>



<p>According to Mr Nitiwul, the scale and cross-border nature of the attack demand focused leadership, intelligence coordination and direct engagement with authorities in Burkina Faso, responsibilities he insists fall squarely within the mandate of a Defence Minister.</p>



<p>He argued that leaving the position without a substantive occupant risks weakening Ghana’s preparedness at a time when the West African sub-region is facing heightened security threats.</p>



<p>“I just think that the Ghanaian government must be explaining to us what happened, the circumstances,” he said. </p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/ghanaians-death-toll-in-burkina-faso-terror-attack-now-8/">Read also: Ghanaians death toll in Burkina Faso terror attack now 8</a></li>
</ul>



<p>“They&#8217;ve come out officially with some statement, but we want a detailed explanation, either by the Foreign Minister or by the Defence Minister.”</p>



<p>He maintained that by now, a Defence Minister should have travelled to Burkina Faso with a team to engage counterparts and oversee investigations.</p>



<p>“That’s why I kept on calling that the President should have appointed a Defence Minister, because by this time the Minister for Defence should have been on the flight to Burkina with his team,” he stated.</p>



<p>Mr Nitiwul stressed that the responsibility does not lie with the Interior Minister, noting that internal security oversight ends at Ghana’s borders.</p>



<p>“This is not the job of the Interior Minister. He’s my friend. Unfortunately, that’s not his job. If he goes there, he’ll go and meet the Defence Minister. It’s the soldiers who are fighting the terrorists. It’s not the Interior Minister’s job,” he said.</p>



<p>He further argued that it is the duty of the Defence Minister, working with defence intelligence and national security structures, to set up a team to investigate what happened, establish the circumstances leading to the attack and recommend measures to prevent a recurrence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana’s private capital and investment industry is entering a new phase of ecosystem strengthening, following Switzerland’s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO)’s deeper engagement in SME financing through the Ghana Investment Support Programme (GhISP). </p>



<p>With SECO joining forces with British International Investment under GhISP, the partnership is reinforcing the work of the Ghana Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (GVCA) to unlock long-term capital for small and medium-sized enterprises and build a more resilient private capital market in Ghana.</p>



<p>At a high-level stakeholder gathering in Accra, the GVCA underscored the urgent need for stronger coordination across debt, credit, equity and technical support platforms to accelerate SME growth and attract long-term capital.</p>



<p>The Chief Executive Officer of the association, Amma Gyampo, described the emerging partnerships as a turning point for Ghana’s SME financing architecture.</p>



<p>“It’s really critical for us to see more collaboration in the SME financing space between debt, between credit, between equity and support systems, support programmes like the Ghana Investment Support Programme,” she said.</p>



<p>The GhISP, powered by British International Investment and supported by SECO, is designed to strengthen investment readiness and expand deal flow to underserved SMEs in Ghana. </p>



<p>The initiative places particular emphasis on gender-smart investing, diversity-lens strategies and climate-aligned finance. For the venture capital community, the programme signals more than technical assistance. It represents a coordinated attempt to elevate the broader private capital ecosystem.</p>



<p>“I think it’s so exciting for us to see a collaboration of this nature, so we can actually elevate some of the ecosystem activities already ongoing to develop our venture capital and private equity managers, to develop their funds, to make the policy environment much friendlier for us to build a very resilient and competitive financial ecosystem,” Ms Gyampo noted.</p>

<p>The event brought together development finance institutions, private capital funds, transaction advisers, SMEs and ecosystem partners. Representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the British High Commission, the Swiss Embassy, as well as BII and SECO, reaffirmed their commitment to private sector development as a driver of inclusive growth.</p>



<p>Ghana’s SME sector remains the backbone of the economy, accounting for a significant share of employment and enterprise activity. Yet access to long-term, patient capital continues to constrain expansion, innovation and competitiveness. </p>



<p>Industry players argue that bridging the financing gap requires coordinated policy reform, stronger fund management capacity and increased local capital mobilisation.</p>



<p>Ms Gyampo stressed that the collaboration could serve as a catalyst for deeper capital allocation to indigenous businesses.</p>



<p>“We’re very excited to have this collaboration come to fruition, and we see this as being a great catalyst for even more support to increase the allocation of funding available for our local companies through our own local investment funds and our fund managers,” she said.</p>



<p>By aligning technical assistance with investment strategies, GhISP aims to drive measurable development impact while crowding in private capital. The programme focuses on pipeline development, capacity building for fund managers and SMEs, and improving the overall investment climate to attract both domestic and international investors.</p>



<p>For GVCA, the long-term objective is clear: to build a resilient and competitive financial ecosystem capable of channelling sustainable capital into growth-ready enterprises.</p>



<p>Ultimately, as Gyampo emphasised, the goal is “to fuel the growth of our SMEs, our small businesses, our medium-sized businesses in particular, which are ripe for investments of this nature.”</p>



<p>With global development partners reinforcing Ghana’s private capital framework, stakeholders believe the country is better positioned to unlock the full potential of its SME sector and strengthen its role as a competitive investment destination in West Africa.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Former Defence Minister Dominic Nitiwul has sharply criticized President John Dramani Mahama over the prolonged absence of a substantive Defence Minister, warning that Ghana’s security architecture is being exposed amid rising regional threats.</p>



<p>Speaking on the floor of Parliament on Wednesday, he said the recent terrorist attack on Ghanaian tomato traders in Burkina Faso that killed eight highlights the urgent need for focused leadership at the Defence Ministry.</p>



<p>He argued that the cross-border nature and scale of the attack require a fully mandated Defence Minister to coordinate investigations, intelligence, and a decisive national response.</p>



<p>“I just think that the Ghanaian government must be explaining to us what happened, the circumstances. I think the government has not yet come out. They&#8217;ve come out officially with some statement, but we want a detailed explanation either by the Foreign Minister or by the Defence Minister,” he said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/NITIWUL-SUBSTANTIVE.mp3-online-audio-converter.com_.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>He stressed that the Defence Minister, rather than the Interior Minister, should have led the response:</p>



<p>“That’s why I kept on calling for the President to appoint a Defence Minister, because by this time the Minister for Defence should have been on the flight to Burkina with his team. This is not the job of the Interior Minister… the Interior Minister’s job ends at Paga on the border.</p>



<p>&#8220;It doesn’t go beyond the border. It’s the duty of the Minister for Defence, with defence intelligence and National Security, to have gone there, set up a team, investigate, and ensure that they find out the circumstances that led to it and how to prevent it from happening again,” he explained.</p>



<p>Mr Nitiwul warned that leaving the Defence Ministry without a substantive occupant risks weakening intelligence coordination and undermining Ghana’s preparedness at a time of heightened regional instability.</p>

<p>The Mfantsipim Old Boys Association (MOBA) has officially commenced activities toward the historic celebration of the 150th Anniversary of Mfantsipim with a Pre-Launch press briefing held at the MOBA Secretariat in Accra. </p>



<p>The ceremony, held as part of the structured build-up to the school’s sesquicentennial celebration, convened distinguished alumni, members of Mfantsipim School&#8217;s Governing Council, revered faith leaders, representatives of the Ghana Education Service (GES), and members of the Anniversary Planning Committee.</p>



<p>The Pre-Launch press briefing follows an earlier milestone occasion, the official unveiling of the 150th Anniversary logo, a powerful visual identity that encapsulates the heritage, values, and forward-looking aspirations of Mfantsipim School.</p>



<p>Delivering remarks at the briefing and representing the Presiding Bishop of the Methodist Church in Ghana, Rt Rev Emmanuel Borlabi Bortey reflected on Mfantsipims’ enduring role in shaping Ghana’s moral, intellectual, and leadership landscape. </p>



<p>He noted that for 150 years, the school has remained a beacon of discipline, character formation, and holistic education, producing alumni who continue to distinguish themselves across diverse sectors in Ghana and globally. </p>

<p>He emphasised virtues such as integrity, humility, diligence, accountability, and purposeful leadership as the moral compass guiding generations of Mfantsipim alumni.</p>



<p>President of the 150th Anniversary Planning Committee, Captain John B. Yamoah, described the forthcoming celebration as “a remarkable milestone that will be etched permanently in the annals of Ghanaian history.” He noted that the sesquicentennial is not merely a commemoration of longevity, but a moment of reflection, renewal, and recommitment to the school’s founding ideals.</p>



<p>He also announced that the official unveiling of the 150th Anniversary commemorative cloth will take place on March 20th at Wesley Towers in Accra, calling on distinguished members of the MOBA fraternity to proudly adorn the anniversary cloth as a visible symbol of unity, heritage, and collective pride, ensuring dignified representation befitting the Mfantsipim brand.</p>



<p>Captain Yamoah also cautioned against any misrepresentation of the school’s name, emphasising that the institution remains Mfantsipim School, or simply Mfantsipim, and should not be inaccurately referred to as “Mfantsipim Senior Secondary” or “Mfantsipim Senior High.” </p>



<p>He underscored that the Mfantsipim brand is singular, historic, and irreplicable, and must be treated with the reverence it commands.</p>



<p>Also addressing the gathering, the Director-General of the Ghana Education Service, Prof. Ernest Kofi Davis, reaffirmed the Service’s steadfast commitment to strengthening second-cycle education across Ghana. </p>



<p>He recognised Mfantsipim School as one of the nation’s foremost torchbearers of academic excellence, acknowledging its profound contribution to the nation’s intellectual and leadership landscape over the past century and a half. </p>



<p>He further called on old students across all second-cycle institutions to actively support their alma mater, particularly in the areas of academic advancement and infrastructure development, to ensure sustained excellence within Ghana’s educational landscape.</p>



<p>In his remarks, the Headmaster of Mfantsipim School, Prof. Ebenezer Aidoo, described the institution as a model of discipline and holistic learning, committed to nurturing not only intellectual excellence but also moral character and civic responsibility.</p>



<p>As the School approaches its sesquicentennial climax in Cape Coast, Mfantsipim at 150 stands as both a celebration of legacy and a renewed commitment to faith, excellence, and purposeful leadership, true to its timeless call, Dwen Hwe Kan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A major agricultural transformation is taking shape along Ghana’s Volta corridor — but its success, the Millennium Development Authority (MiDA) says, hinges on one critical factor: land.</p>



<p>On a high-powered inspection tour of the White and Black Volta basins led by the Board Chairman of MiDA, Dr Charles Abugre; the MiDA Chief Executive Mr. Alexander Kofi-Mensah Mould directly appealed to traditional leaders to release lands to drive President John Dramani Mahama’s 24-Hour Plus Programme through the creation of large-scale Agro-Ecological Parks (AEPs).</p>



<p>“The success of the 24-hour agricultural programme depends heavily on land availability,” Mr. Mould stressed during a courtesy call on the Worawora Traditional Council. “We are counting on you to help unlock the agricultural potential of this area.”</p>



<p><strong>Worawora commits land for large scale farming</strong></p>



<p>In a strong show of support, Daasebre Sarfro Baah III, Chief of Worawora, announced that thousands of acres have already been set aside for the commercial cultivation of ginger, chilli pepper and rice for export.</p>



<p>“The people of Worawora are ready,” the chief declared, urging government to back the initiative with irrigation and farm inputs to scale production.</p>



<p>The proposed Agro-Ecological Parks are expected to operate as integrated 24-hour agro-industrial zones — combining farming, processing, storage, logistics and export to boost jobs and foreign exchange earnings.</p>



<p><strong>Water wasted, dams questioned</strong></p>



<p>However, the tour exposed serious infrastructure bottlenecks that could undermine the vision.</p>



<p>Despite proximity to Lake Volta, many communities lack irrigation, relying solely on rainfall for farming.</p>



<p>“Water is flowing beside these communities, yet farmers depend on rain,” the MiDA boss observed.</p>



<p>In parts of the Northern Region, incomplete facilities under the One Village One Dam initiative drew sharp criticism.</p>



<p>“What we saw in some cases are dugouts masquerading as dams,” Mr. Mould stated bluntly.</p>



<p><strong>Export ambitions</strong></p>



<p>Kubungu has meanwhile been identified as a potential cold chain logistics hub linked to Tamale Airport to support fruit, vegetable and nuts exports.</p>



<p>MiDA is expected to submit a comprehensive technical report in the coming months to guide investment and inter-agency coordination.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ghana Football Association’s announcement of a pre-World Cup friendly against Mexico in May should have been reassuring news. On the surface, it signals ambition, a chance for the Black Stars to test themselves against one of the tournament’s co-hosts. However, the timing of the fixture has sparked genuine concern.</p>



<p>Ghana are already scheduled to face Austria and Germany in March as part of preparations for the FIFA World Cup in June. However, the newly announced clash against Mexico is set for May 22, a date that falls outside the FIFA international window. That detail cannot be ignored. </p>



<p>The rest and release period for the FIFA World Cup 2026 will begin on Monday, 25 May 2026, with exceptions for players involved in the final matches of confederation club tournaments, as approved by FIFA, up to and including 30 May 2026.</p>



<p>Playing outside the FIFA calendar means clubs are under no obligation to release their players. In practical terms, Ghana could head into what is supposed to be a crucial World Cup tune-up without several key members of the squad. With most major European leagues still in season by May 22, the risk of losing important players is not hypothetical; it is very real.</p>



<p>After missing out on AFCON in Morocco, a major opportunity to fine-tune the team in competitive conditions, these friendlies are no longer just routine exhibitions. They represent the only meaningful platform for head coach Otto Addo to refine tactics, test combinations, and build chemistry ahead of the World Cup. That makes the possibility of an incomplete squad even more troubling.</p>



<p>With just weeks to the tournament, friendlies of this magnitude should be used to solidify plans with the core group expected to board the plane, not to stage another round of auditions.</p>



<p>Last year’s Unity Cup in London offers a cautionary example. Ghana were without regulars such as Mohammed Kudus, Thomas Partey, Antoine Semenyo and Alexander Djiku. Eleven players who featured in that mini tournament did not return for the next four competitive fixtures, raising serious questions about the long-term value of the exercise. In fact, only one of those absentees, Abu Francis, eventually reappeared during the friendlies against South Korea and Japan in November 2025.</p>



<p>On paper, the Black Stars have lined up high-quality opposition in the build-up to the World Cup. In reality, constant squad changes, whether due to poor fixture planning or player unavailability, have made it difficult to assess how beneficial these games truly are.</p>



<p>The situation is already complicated by injury concerns. Mohammed Kudus is set to miss the March friendlies against Austria and Germany, and there is a strong possibility he will also be unavailable for the Mexico clash, with Tottenham Hotspur scheduled to play during that same week. If that happens, a player almost certain to start all three group matches at the World Cup could miss the last five high-profile preparatory games.</p>



<p>Yes, Ghana are not the only nation arranging friendlies during unconventional windows. But Ghana’s context is different. Having missed AFCON and with limited opportunities left to prepare, every match carries extra weight. That is why the planning must be precise, and why the Mexico fixture, as currently scheduled, raises more questions than confidence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ghana Health Service (GHS) has directed all Regional Health Directorates to immediately strengthen security and patient care systems across health facilities following the reported missing baby incident at Mamprobi Hospital.</p>



<p>In a directive issued on February 18, 2026, and signed by Samuel Kaba Akoriyea, Director-General of the Ghana Health Service, regional directors have been instructed to implement comprehensive measures aimed at safeguarding patients, particularly newborns and other vulnerable groups.</p>



<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E8ZRF4kaubleac5fQE11JWPEgVuTfX_U/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>



<p>The directive comes in the wake of a disturbing incident in which a baby was allegedly stolen from the Mamprobi Polyclinic in Accra on Tuesday, February 18, by a female suspect, prompting the Service to tighten security and internal protocols across health facilities nationwide.</p>

</ul>



<p>Among the immediate measures outlined are enhanced staff identification systems, including the mandatory wearing of uniforms and name tags at all times within health facilities.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rVublNZANq8?si=nVOqPIqNHQLaKR2n" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>Facilities have also been directed to ensure a dedicated presence at post-natal wards to improve supervision and monitoring. </p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mXMek5eUEG4?si=YKGqNppZHNwtyTzW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>The GHS has further ordered the introduction of a mandatory discharge verification system to ensure proper checks before patients, particularly newborns, are discharged.</p>

</ul>



<p>In addition, all facilities are to upgrade and maintain their CCTV systems to strengthen surveillance, while staff training is to be intensified to reinforce security awareness and patient care standards.</p>



<p>According to the Director-General, the effective implementation of these measures is critical to preventing a recurrence of such incidents and ensuring the highest standards of patient care across the country.</p>

<p>Vice Chairperson of Parliament’s Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration Committee has called on the government to provide immediate psychological support to victims affected by foreign national exploitation.</p>



<p>According to Cletus Seidu Dapilah, failure to do so could lead to serious consequences.</p>



<p>&#8220;First and foremost, the victims need to be identified and given counselling. Otherwise, in the coming days, we may hear of suicides occurring,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Dapilah stressed that the immediate focus should be on supporting the affected families and providing mental health services. </p>



<p>“The government, through the relevant ministries, should engage psychologists to counsel the victims, encouraging them that this is not the end of their life and that the future is still bright. Pain will eventually pass,” he added.</p>



<p>He stressed that the government should not take the situation lightly, noting that the victims’ mental and emotional recovery is as important as pursuing legal action against the suspect.</p>



<p>This comes after a Russian national allegedly lured Ghanaian women, recorded intimate encounters without their consent, and subsequently published the videos online, reportedly for financial gain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Africa’s rising generation of business and policy leaders has issued a sweeping declaration aimed at reshaping the continent’s economic and cultural trajectory.</p>



<p>Meeting on 14 February 2026 at the Kempinski Hotel Gold Coast City in Accra, participants at the Forty Under 40 Africa Summit announced what they described as a decisive reset of “the African mind” — signalling a shift from rhetoric to measurable execution.</p>



<p>Held under the endorsement of Ghana’s Ministry of Tourism, Culture &amp; Creative Arts and the Ministry of Youth Development and Empowerment, the summit brought together innovators, entrepreneurs and emerging industry captains from across the continent.</p>



<p><strong>From potential to performance</strong></p>



<p>In a strongly worded communiqué, the summit declared that “history is not a burden to be carried, but a foundation to be built upon,” arguing that Africa must move beyond being described as a continent of promise.</p>



<p>“For too long, the African narrative has been written in the ink of potential; today, we transition to the steel of performance,” the statement said.</p>



<p>Delegates committed to what they termed “execution over excuse”, embracing a results-driven culture where performance becomes the sole benchmark of progress.</p>



<p>Guided by insights from Kris Senanu, Head Judge of the awards scheme and Chairman of Blackrock, participants pledged to entrench discipline, accountability and measurable outcomes in African enterprise and leadership.</p>



<p><strong>Industrial sovereignty and value addition</strong></p>



<p>A key pillar of the declaration centred on industrial transformation. Speakers emphasised the urgency of ending Africa’s long-standing dependence on raw exports.<br>Echoing sentiments articulated by Gertrude Emefa Donkor, Managing Director of Goldbod Jewellery, the summit stressed aggressive value addition and strategic policy implementation.<br>“Our gold, our minerals, and our labour must no longer be raw exports, but the refined pillars of a global economy,” the communiqué stated.</p>



<p>The call aligns with a broader continental push for industrial sovereignty — positioning domestic strength as the foundation for global competitiveness.</p>



<p><strong>Architecture of dominance</strong></p>



<p>Rejecting the label of a “continent of the future”, the summit insisted that “the future is a geographical reality we occupy now.”</p>



<p>Referencing business leaders such as Daniel McKorley of the Macdan Group, delegates underscored the importance of building resilient local enterprises as a prerequisite for international influence.</p>



<p>Central to this blueprint is the endorsement of the 24-hour economy model. Inspired by Ishmael Nii Amanor Dodoo, Director and Head of Partnership and Markets for the 24-Hour Economy initiative, participants described time as Africa’s most underutilised asset.</p>



<p>“Time is our most precious resource; we shall use every hour to close the developmental gap,” the statement affirmed.</p>



<p>The summit also highlighted economic diplomacy, including diaspora engagement and global payment systems such as PayAngel, as critical tools for bridging Africa with its global family and unlocking capital flows.</p>



<p><strong>Faith, strategy and the prepared mind</strong></p>



<p>In what organisers described as a moment of introspection, delegates confronted the tension between faith and pragmatism. Led by Richard Abbey Jnr, discussions centred on whether Africa risks substituting spirituality for strategy.</p>



<p>While affirming that faith remains central to African identity, the communiqué concluded that it “must not become a substitute for strategy.” Participants pledged commitment to a “theology of work”, insisting that opportunity must meet preparation.</p>



<p>“While providence may provide the opportunity, only the prepared mind can seize it,” the statement noted.</p>



<p><strong>Culture as currency</strong></p>



<p>Beyond economics, the summit positioned African culture — particularly fashion and the creative arts — as a high-value export capable of shaping global trends.</p>



<p>Through initiatives such as “Fashion of the 5”, delegates affirmed that African craftsmanship must move from imitation to leadership in the global cultural marketplace.</p>



<p><strong>An irrevocable compact</strong></p>



<p>The summit concluded with a bold declaration: “The era of the African apology is over.” “We have moved from the ‘Arrival of Guests’ to the arrival of leaders,” the communiqué said, describing the declaration as an irrevocable compact to “solve African problems with African brilliance.”</p>



<p>Organisers of the Forty Under 40 Africa Awards said the summit builds on a platform that has, since inception, honoured more than 2,000 young African leaders across industries. The initiative aims to deepen a pan-African network rooted in leadership, excellence and measurable impact.</p>



<p>With this latest declaration, participants signalled that Africa’s next chapter will not be defined by aspiration alone, but by disciplined execution — and an unapologetic bid for global relevance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana began 2026 remaining in the 4<sup>th</sup> position in Africa with the highest debt to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>



<p>The country’s exposure to the IMF stood at Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 1.96 billion in February 2026, higher than the SDR 2.85 billion as of 22<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;December 2025.</p>



<p>This was equivalent to US$2.84 billion.</p>



<p>The reduction in the country’s indebtedness to the Bretton Woods institution is due to repayment of some of the outstanding debt.</p>



<p>Egypt remained 1<sup>st</sup> in Africa with the highest debt to the IMF. It owed the Fund US$5.88 billion.</p>



<p>It was followed by Côte d&#8217;Ivoire (US$3.62 billion), Kenya (2.93 billion) and Angola (US$2.49 billion) in 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> respectively.</p>



<p>Ghana’s public debt reduced by GH¢40 billion between September 2025 and November 2025 to GH¢644.6 billion.</p>



<p>This was approximately 45.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</p>



<p>However, in dollar terms, the total public debt stood at US$57.2 billion in November 2025, lower than US$57.8 billion recorded in October 2025, but higher than the US$55.1 billion recorded in September 2025.</p>



<p>According to data from the Bank of Ghana, the country’s public debt stood at GH¢630.2 billion in October 2026.</p>

<p>Chief Executive Officer of the Minerals Commission, Isaac Tandoh, has announced a sweeping set of reforms aimed at restoring Ghanaian ownership and control of the country’s mining industry, including the revocation of more than 300 fraudulently acquired or dormant small-scale mining licences.</p>



<p>Speaking at the maiden Mining Local Content Summit 2026 in Takoradi, Mr Tandoh questioned whether Ghana had fully taken charge of its mineral resources more than 70 years after independence.</p>



<p>The Mining Local Content Summit 2026 is the first major technical forum dedicated to promoting Ghanaian participation across the mining value chain.</p>



<p>For decades, Ghana’s mining industry has largely operated on an extraction-based model, with most technical services and profits flowing abroad.</p>



<p>The new reforms mark a shift toward value retention, aimed at ensuring that billions of cedis spent annually on equipment, engineering, and services remain within the local economy.</p>



<p>Observers say the success of the reforms will depend on sustained enforcement and political commitment, as the government seeks to build a mining sector that creates lasting wealth beyond mineral extraction.</p>



<p>“While we have made gains in local employment, there is a difference between providing labour and exercising control,” he said.</p>



<p>A major focus of his address was the practice of “fronting”, where foreign operators hide behind Ghanaian names to secure mining licences while retaining ownership and profits.</p>



<p>Mr Tandoh described the practice as unethical and directly linked it to illegal mining, known locally as galamsey.</p>



<p>“Some Ghanaians are being used to disempower their own people,” he warned, urging citizens to stop facilitating such arrangements.</p>



<p>He said under the policy direction of the Minister for Lands and Natural Resources, Emmanuel Armah-Kofi Buah, the Commission has shifted from paperwork to active enforcement over the past year.</p>



<p>As part of this approach, more than 300 inactive and improperly acquired licences have been withdrawn, while District Mining Committees have been activated to ensure that no licence is processed without input from local authorities.</p>



<p>According to him, the reforms are intended to improve transparency and reduce political and foreign influence in the licensing process.</p>



<p>Mr Tandoh also announced a comprehensive review of the Minerals and Mining Act (Act 703), including the revocation of LI 2462, which previously allowed mining in forest reserves.</p>



<p>He said the government is also introducing a new medium-scale mining category to support responsible Ghanaian operators who fall between small and large-scale mining.</p>



<p>In a move expected to affect multinational companies, the Commission is phasing out long-term “Development Agreements”, which he said had often been abused.</p>



<p>“Some companies use revenue from Ghana to develop mines elsewhere while failing to meet basic obligations to our districts,” he noted.</p>



<p>To replace the agreements, the government is proposing a more flexible royalty system that will allow Ghanaians to benefit directly from high global gold prices.</p>



<p>Mr Tandoh said the reforms are aligned with President John Dramani Mahama’s “Reset Agenda”, which seeks to strengthen local participation across key sectors of the economy.</p>



<p>He stressed that local content would no longer be treated as a mere regulatory requirement.</p>



<p>“Local content is no longer a compliance checkbox. It is now a strategic priority in every mining agreement,” he stated.</p>



<p>The Minerals Commission CEO assured “genuine investors” of the government’s readiness to work with partners committed to Ghana’s development, while pledging to confront those exploiting regulatory loopholes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Criminologist and Lecturer, KNUST, Dr Jones Opoku Ware, says that bringing a Russian national accused of committing a crime in Ghana to justice may prove challenging due to the absence of an extradition treaty between the two countries.</p>



<p>According to him, Interpol, which facilitates international information sharing, has limited powers in such cases, meaning it cannot compel the suspect’s return.</p>



<p>“We are looking at a foreign citizen who entered Ghana to commit a crime. If this person leaves the country, getting them back will be a very tall order because Ghana does not have any existing extradition agreements with Russia,” he explained in an interview on <strong>Joy FM&#8217;s Top Story</strong>.</p>



<p>The government has launched efforts to extradite a foreign national alleged to have secretly filmed and circulated intimate videos of Ghanaian women without their consent.</p>



<p>Samuel Nartey George, Minister for Communication, Digital Technology and Innovation, stated that authorities will use diplomatic and legal means to ensure the suspect is brought to Ghana and prosecuted under the country’s cybersecurity laws.</p>



<p>However, Dr Opoku Ware noted that without a formal treaty, the government’s options are limited to diplomatic channels and appeals to the Russian authorities. The case is further complicated if the suspect has ties or protection under Russian jurisdiction, he added.</p>



<p>“The government is exploring all possible options to ensure justice for the victims. At this point, we may have to appeal to the conscience of the Russian Republic to achieve some form of reparations or compensation,” the criminologist said.</p>



<p>“It’s a very complex issue. While the government will explore all avenues, securing justice will require careful diplomatic engagement and patience,” the expert added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, has criticised Ghana’s two dominant political parties, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the New Patriotic Party (NPP), for failing to present female candidates in the upcoming Ayawaso East by-election.</p>



<p>Speaking at a forum on Political Inclusion and Consensus Building, organised by the Africa Center for Parliamentary Affairs, the Speaker said the absence of women candidates reflects a deeper failure by political parties to promote gender inclusion and leadership development.</p>



<p>“Inclusion must begin in parties and mature in Parliament. I was waiting for any party to have fielded a female in the Ayawaso by-election, and I was personally going to support the candidate because we need more of our women in Parliament. Unfortunately, the parties have disappointed me,” he said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/SPEAKER-AYAWASO-WOMEN.mp3.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>Mr Bagbin stressed that political parties should not merely function as vehicles for electoral competition but must serve as training grounds for leadership and national development. </p>



<p>“Political parties are often seen as vehicles of electoral competition. But they are much more than that. Political parties constitute schools of leadership,” he added.</p>



<p>The Speaker also raised concerns about Ghana’s political structure, arguing that the country needs a strong third political force to balance the dominance of the NDC and NPP.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/ndc-sticks-with-baba-jamal-for-ayawaso-east-by-election-despite-vote-buying-probe/">Read also: NDC sticks with Baba Jamal for Ayawaso East By-election despite vote-buying probe</a></li>
</ul>



<p>He recalled the early years of Ghana’s Fourth Republic, noting the diversity and national integration fostered by party congresses in the 1990s. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/BAGBIN-THIRD-FORCE.mp3.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p>“We now seem to have only two strong, vibrant, surviving parties. For me, I think we need a third force,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Bagbin maintained that greater political diversity and stronger female representation in Parliament are essential for deepening democracy, strengthening inclusion, and building a more representative and resilient political system in Ghana.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Bank of Ghana (BoG) has assured the public and financial sector players that the regulation of virtual assets in Ghana is not intended to create an alternative or “parallel” financial system, but to expand the existing regulatory perimeter.</p>



<p>With the Virtual Asset Service Providers Act now enacted, the central bank says the focus has shifted to putting the law into operation in a structured and orderly way. The Act establishes a formal regulatory framework for digital asset activities, marking a major step in Ghana’s approach to emerging financial technologies.</p>



<p>“We are not creating a parallel financial system,” the Governor stated firmly. “All we are doing is extending the perimeter of the existing one.”</p>



<p>He explained that the next phase involves the development of regulatory frameworks, supervisory processes, and coordination mechanisms necessary to bring the Act fully into effect. This work is ongoing and will involve close engagement with industry players and other regulators.</p>



<p><strong>Banks Will Be Integrated, Not Sidelined</strong></p>



<p>Contrary to concerns that digital assets might operate outside traditional financial structures, the Bank of Ghana emphasised that banks will be an integral part of the digital asset ecosystem.</p>



<p>“Banks are not observers in this space; virtual assets will interact with the banking system through settlement accounts, custody arrangements, compliance infrastructure, and payment channels,” the Governor said.</p>



<p>He noted that institutions which proactively build capacity in key areas such as digital asset risk assessment, transaction monitoring, and technology governance will be better positioned to participate responsibly in this evolving space.</p>



<p><strong>Balancing Innovation with Stability</strong></p>



<p>BoG’s position reflects a broader ambition to balance innovation with financial stability and consumer protection. By bringing digital assets within a clear regulatory perimeter, the Bank aims to mitigate risks such as fraud, money laundering, and market abuse, while enabling legitimate business activities and investment.</p>



<p>The Governor highlighted that effective regulation and supervision will rely on coordinated efforts between the central bank, industry players, and other regulatory bodies. The approach is expected to provide greater legal certainty for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and protect end-users.</p>



<p><strong>What This Means for the Financial System</strong></p>



<p>Financial analysts say the Bank’s stance should help promote trust and transparency in the market. By integrating digital assets into the existing financial system, rather than isolating them, Ghana is positioning itself to benefit from technological innovation without undermining the core stability of its financial sector.</p>



<p>With attention now on operationalization, banks and other financial institutions are being encouraged to adapt their systems and internal controls to manage digital asset-related risks effectively.</p>

<p>The Secretary-General of the Pan-African Youth Union, H.E. Wiisichong Bening Ahmed, has paid a courtesy call on the Chief Executive Officer of the National Youth Authority (NYA), Osman Ayariga, at the Authority’s headquarters to explore areas of mutual collaboration.</p>

<p>Central to the discussions was how African countries can leverage skills training schemes to equip young people with employable competencies.</p>



<p>Particular attention was given to Ghana’s National Apprenticeship Programme and other technical and vocational training models that could be enhanced and replicated to tackle youth unemployment and promote entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>Mr Ayariga reaffirmed the NYA’s commitment to deepening collaboration with continental youth institutions to advance capacity-building efforts and create sustainable opportunities for young people, stressing that empowering Africa’s youth remains essential to the continent’s long-term growth and transformation.</p>

<p>According to the NYA CEO, discussions centred on how African countries can leverage skills training initiatives to equip young people with practical and employable competencies.</p>



<p>Particular emphasis was placed on Ghana’s National Apprenticeship Programme and other technical and vocational pathways as models that could be strengthened and replicated to enhance youth employment and entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>Black Stars head coach Otto Addo delivered a lecture to students of the University of Ghana’s Department of Physical Education and Sports at the Rugby Stadium as part of a special colloquium themed “Individual Player Development.”</p>



<p>Speaking at the event, Otto Addo said it has always been an honour to give back to students and share his experiences.</p>



<p>“I am happy to connect with universities. When I was working in Dortmund, we had good collaboration with students,” he said.</p>



<p>His lecture focused on player development, particularly how young, talented players can be given the right guidance during the transitional phase of breaking into the first team.</p>



<p>“I decided to pick a topic for young players in this transitional era, when they are trying to make it into the first team,” he explained.</p>



<p>Otto Addo concluded by urging athletes to prioritise education alongside their sporting careers.</p>

<p></p>



<p>“Football has moved beyond just playing on the field. It’s also about learning beyond the field and using science-backed knowledge to understand why certain things happen,” he said.</p>



<p>The Head of Department at the University of Ghana’s Department of Physical Education, Annabella Osei Tutu, said the students were inspired by Addo’s presentation.</p>



<p>“The students are highly motivated and inspired by Otto Addo’s career trajectory,” she noted.</p>



<p>The colloquium is designed to help students recognise the great opportunities available to them in the sports industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Member of Parliament for Bekwai, Ralph Poku-Adusei, has donated a substantial relief package to Danyaseman Catholic Senior High School, which recently suffered a devastating disaster.</p>



<p>The relief items, presented on Wednesday, February 18, include 100 bags of cement, 10 packets of roofing sheets, and Ghs 5,000 cash. </p>



<p>Accompanied by officials from the Municipal Education Directorate, the MP acknowledged the school&#8217;s infrastructure struggles since 2010 and assured staff and students of his commitment to supporting the school.</p>

<p>Notably, as of the time of the donation, neither NADMO nor the Municipal Assembly had visited or provided aid to the school, despite the severity of the situation. </p>



<p>Mr Poku-Adusei, leaving his busy schedule in Parliament, intervened to address the issue, bypassing bureaucratic processes to respond swiftly, having witnessed the devastation firsthand.</p>

<p>He praised teachers for their dedication, citing their funding of a 3-unit classroom block and headmaster&#8217;s office.</p>



<p>The headmaster, receiving the donation, expressed appreciation for the MP&#8217;s timely intervention. He noted that apart from a boys&#8217; dormitory built since 2010, this is the first donation from an MP to support the school.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Financial services leaders across Africa are entering 2026 with renewed confidence, placing artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, regulatory resilience and strategic growth at the centre of their transformation agendas. This is according to insights from KPMG’s 2025 Global CEO Outlook, with a focus on the Banking and Capital Markets, and Insurance sectors.</p>



<p>Despite ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, economic volatility and regulatory complexity, CEOs across both sectors are demonstrating strong appetite for growth and technology-led reinvention.</p>



<p>Insurance: Confidence rising as technology and sustainability reshape the sector</p>



<p>Insurance CEOs are increasingly confident in their organisations’ growth prospects. Globally, 82% of insurance CEOs are confident in their company’s growth, up from 74% in 2024, a significant year-on-year increase. Expansion across health, life and specialty lines, including cyber and business interruption, is contributing to improved earnings and sector momentum.</p>



<p>AI adoption is accelerating across underwriting, onboarding, claims processing and cyber defence. Globally, 67% of CEOs expect returns from AI investments within one to three years, compared to 21% last year, and two thirds plan to allocate 10–20% of their budgets towards AI initiatives.</p>



<p>Workforce transformation is a parallel priority. Seventy-seven percent of global insurance CEOs cite AI workforce readiness and upskilling as a top constraint on growth, while 83% say AI is reshaping training and development, and 79% believe it is changing the skills required for entry-level roles.</p>



<p>Sustainability and ESG compliance remain high on the agenda, particularly as regulatory standards tighten globally. More than half (55%) of global insurance CEOs identify ESG reporting and compliance as their primary ESG priority. Given that many African regulatory frameworks follow European trends, this is a critical area of focus for insurers across the continent.</p>



<p>Cyber risk remains a dominant concern. Eighty-three percent of insurance CEOs identify cybercrime as the biggest barrier to organisational growth, with cybersecurity and digital risk resilience ranking as the leading area for risk mitigation investment.</p>



<p>Mark Danckwerts, Head of Insurance, KPMG One Africa&nbsp;said:<br>“Insurance leaders across Africa are navigating a complex operating environment, but they are doing so from a position of growing confidence. AI presents enormous opportunity to improve efficiency, risk assessment and customer engagement. However, sustainable success will depend on responsible adoption, workforce readiness and strong cyber resilience. Insurers that balance innovation with trust will be best placed to outperform.”</p>



<p>The appetite for inorganic growth remains strong, with the insurance sector showing one of the highest levels of high-impact mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) activity globally, a trend reflected in several African markets in recent years.</p>



<p>Banking and Capital Markets: AI at the heart of strategic reinvention</p>



<p>For banks across Africa, AI is the predominant theme shaping CEO priorities.</p>



<p>“Technology, in particular AI, presents a huge opportunity, but also a challenge in terms of where to prioritise, how to achieve a measurable return on investment (ROI), and how to ensure responsible and safe adoption to maintain trust,” said&nbsp;Pierre Fourie, KPMG One Africa Head of Financial Services.</p>



<p>“Banks need to modernise legacy IT, cope with rising financial crime risk, made more difficult by sophisticated scams using AI, address new competitive threats from fintechs and nimble, cloud-native banks, and comply with complex and changing regulations.”</p>



<p>AI is seen as both an enabler and a risk amplifier. It can significantly enhance customer engagement and deepen understanding of customer needs, yet banks must guard against depersonalising interactions and losing the human touch. At the same time, AI raises the cyber threat landscape while also strengthening banks’ ability to detect and defend against bad actors.</p>



<p>The scale of planned investment is notable:</p>



<p>70% of banking CEOs expect to spend 10–20% of their budgets on AI in the next 12 months.</p>



<p>69% expect ROI from AI investments within one to three years, up sharply from 13% last year.</p>



<p>78% say AI workforce readiness or AI upskilling could negatively impact the organisation if not adequately addressed.</p>



<p>The top five trends negatively impacting organisational prosperity in banking are:</p>



<p>86% – Cybercrime and cyber insecurity</p>



<p>78% – AI workforce readiness</p>



<p>77% – Successful integration of AI into business processes</p>



<p>75% – Competition for AI talent</p>



<p>75% – Cost of technology infrastructure</p>



<p>Fourie added: “For African banks, AI is not a theoretical discussion — it is a strategic imperative. The ability to integrate AI into core processes, manage cyber risk and build the right talent base will determine competitive advantage. At the same time, banks must modernise legacy systems and manage infrastructure costs, all while protecting trust in an increasingly digital ecosystem.”</p>



<p>Inorganic growth also remains firmly on the agenda. Appetite for strategic transactions is high, with CEOs seeking differentiation through innovation, customer experience and new business models. Notably, 25% of banking CEOs identify ‘strategic differentiation’ as the primary driver of AI adoption, signalling that technology investment is increasingly linked to long-term competitive positioning rather than short-term efficiency alone.</p>



<p>A Pan-African moment for financial services transformation</p>



<p>Across both insurance and banking, a common theme emerges: confidence underpinned by disciplined transformation. AI investment is accelerating, cybersecurity is paramount, ESG compliance is rising in importance, and M&amp;A remains a lever for scale and capability.</p>



<p>For African financial institutions, the challenge, and opportunity, lies in balancing innovation with resilience, and growth with governance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana’s Western Region, is one of the country’s most strategically important and economically dynamic areas. Covering about 13,884 square kilometres and stretching along a 192-kilometre Atlantic coastline, the region combines scale, location, and natural endowments in a way few regions can match. It is bordered by the Western North Region to the north, the Central Region to the east, Côte d’Ivoire to the west, and the Gulf of Guinea to the south, giving it both strong domestic linkages and direct access to international markets.</p>



<p>Beyond its geography, the Western Region stands out as one of Ghana’s most resource-rich and investment-ready destinations. Its natural assets, established infrastructure, and close alignment with national development priorities make it well-suited to integrated, value-chain investments. For investors seeking sustainable returns and long-term growth, the region offers a balanced mix of industrial potential, export connectivity, and strong policy support.</p>



<p><strong>Oil and Gas</strong></p>



<p>The region is the heart of Ghana’s oil and gas industry, hosting major offshore fields, including Jubilee, TEN, and Sankofa. These operations have created sustained demand across the energy value chain, including upstream services, marine logistics, fabrication, midstream infrastructure, downstream processing, and industrial support services. Within this broader ecosystem, the US$60 billion Petroleum Hub project in Jomoro is expected to support refining, petrochemicals, storage, and related industrial activities, complementing existing operations and deepening value addition in the energy sector.</p>



<p><strong>Mining and Mineral Processing</strong></p>



<p>The Western Region is also exceptionally well endowed with mineral resources. It produces a significant share of Ghana’s gold output and hosts deposits of bauxite, manganese, iron ore, limestone, clay, solar salt, and silica. These resources create strong opportunities for mineral processing and beneficiation, including steel and construction materials, cement clinker, manganese refining, and the manufacture of tiles, ceramics, and glass. Supported by established mining infrastructure and supply chains, the region is well positioned as a hub for extractives-linked industrialisation.</p>



<p><strong>Tourism</strong> Tourism and hospitality add a further dimension to the region’s investment appeal. The Western Region has long sandy beaches, rich forest reserves, wetlands, and a deep cultural heritage that remains largely underdeveloped. Destinations such as Cape Three Points and the stilt community of Nzulezu already attract visitors. The region is also home to ecological assets such as the Ankasa Forest Reserve and the Cape Three Points Forest Reserve, as well as historic forts including Fort San Sebastian, Fort Metal Cross, Fort Saint Anthony, and Fort Apollonia. These assets present clear opportunities for eco-tourism, leisure resorts, and culturally grounded hospitality developments.</p>



<p><strong>Agriculture, Agro-Processing and Aquaculture</strong></p>



<p>Agriculture, agro-processing, fisheries, and aquaculture further strengthen the region’s investment profile. The Western Region is one of Ghana’s leading agricultural zones, producing cocoa, rubber, oil palm, coconut, cassava, plantain, rice, and other staples, alongside growing potential in livestock and poultry. These strengths support opportunities in vertically integrated agribusiness and value addition, including cocoa processing, cassava-based industrial products, and refined palm oil. Investors can align with national priorities under the 24-Hour Economy and the Accelerated Export Development Programme, which promote continuous production, value addition, and export-oriented growth.</p>



<p>Along the coast, fisheries and aquaculture offer additional investment opportunities. There is demand for modern fish-processing plants, cold-storage facilities, upgraded landing sites, ice plants, and hygienic fish-handling infrastructure, as well as commercial tilapia and catfish farming. Rising domestic consumption and expanding regional markets make these subsectors commercially attractive while delivering a strong development impact.</p>



<p><strong>Manufacturing and Industrial Development</strong></p>



<p>Light manufacturing is another area of opportunity. Proximity to raw materials, efficient port access, and established industrial clusters make the Western Region well-suited for light manufacturing operations. The Sekondi Industrial Park, a 2,200-acre industrial zone designated for heavy and light manufacturing, warehousing, and related activities, offers rail connectivity to the Port of Takoradi and access to natural gas from the Atuabo Gas Processing Plant. Opportunities include food packaging, cold storage, equipment assembly, and the manufacture of small-scale agricultural machinery and related industries.</p>



<p><strong>Strategic gateway for trade and industry</strong></p>



<p>The region’s strategic importance is anchored by its role as a gateway for trade and industry. The Port of Takoradi—Ghana’s premier commercial port—plays a central role in international trade, industry, and energy logistics. It provides cost-efficient access to global markets while linking Ghana’s northern regions to the landlocked Sahelian economies of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. This advantage is reinforced by the Takoradi Airport and ongoing infrastructure upgrades under the Government’s Big Push initiative. In addition, the planned Abidjan–Lagos Corridor Highway will further integrate the Western Region into one of Africa’s most important economic corridors, expanding access to domestic, regional, and continental markets.</p>



<p><strong>A Supportive Investment Environment</strong></p>



<p>Investment in the Western Region is underpinned by Ghana’s stable democracy, transparent regulatory environment, and investor-friendly legal framework. Government initiatives such as the 24-Hour Economy and infrastructure investments under the Big Push continue to strengthen the business climate. The Western Regional Coordinating Council, together with traditional authorities, also provides strong local support and a welcoming environment for investors.</p>



<p><strong>A Region Ready for Investment</strong></p>



<p>The Western Region is ready for investors seeking to build, process, and export from Ghana. Its combination of natural resources, strategic coastal location, established energy and mining base, and expanding industrial and logistics infrastructure creates clear opportunities for value-chain investments aligned with national development priorities. The GIPC stands ready to support investors at every stage: from identifying opportunities and providing market intelligence, to facilitating approvals, coordinating with key government agencies, and offering dedicated aftercare services. Investors are encouraged to engage the GIPC to access detailed information on priority sectors, available projects, and tailored support for establishing and expanding operations in the region.</p>



<p><strong>Invest in the West and Grow Beyond</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Members of Parliament have called for urgent and stronger measures to combat human trafficking across Ghana, describing recent data on the menace as alarming and a clear call for intensified government action.</p>



<p>The appeal was made during a capacity-building workshop organised for lawmakers by International Justice Mission (IJM), where participants raised concerns about rising trafficking cases and the need for tougher enforcement, improved funding, and stronger oversight mechanisms.</p>



<p>Chairman of Parliament’s Human Rights Committee, Ernest Yaw Anim, said statistics presented at the workshop showed the scale of the problem and demanded immediate intervention from both Parliament and the Executive.</p>



<p>“The numbers that were reported by the various presenters are a call for action, a call for action from Members of Parliament and a call for action from the Executive in how best we can help eradicate and combat trafficking issues in the country,” he said.</p>



<p>He stressed the need for government to review the level of punishment imposed on offenders, questioning whether existing penalties are strong enough to deter human trafficking, particularly child trafficking.</p>



<p>Mr Anim also reaffirmed Parliament’s commitment to strengthening oversight responsibilities to ensure that laws are effectively implemented by relevant state institutions. He noted that the Human Rights Committee, recently formed by the Speaker of Parliament, will work closely with other committees to address funding constraints and improve enforcement efforts.</p>



<p>According to him, Parliament will also push for adequate budgetary allocations to agencies responsible for implementing anti-trafficking laws to enhance their operations nationwide.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Chairperson of Parliament’s Gender and Children Committee, Helen Adjoa Ntoso, acknowledged that completely eradicating human trafficking may be difficult but emphasised the need to reduce its prevalence through targeted social interventions.</p>



<p>She explained that poverty remains a key driver of trafficking, urging government to invest in education, social protection programmes, and economic empowerment initiatives to prevent vulnerable families from exposing their children to exploitation.</p>



<p>“If you don’t want children to go into child labour, you have to provide them with schools and resources,” she said, adding that improving livelihoods in affected communities could significantly reduce the practice.</p>



<p>The National Director of Advocacy and Partnerships at IJM, Worlanyor Kojo Forster, also noted progress in the country’s fight against human trafficking, including increased prosecutions, improved police interventions, and enhanced trauma-informed processes within the justice system.</p>



<p>However, he warned that efforts remain constrained by inadequate funding, particularly for victim rehabilitation and reintegration.</p>



<p>According to him, the Human Trafficking Fund received an allocation of GH¢1 million this year, which he described as insufficient to support victims effectively.</p>



<p>“We need somewhere in the region of four to five million cedis annually to make the fund fully operational,” he said, adding that several government agencies lack basic logistics such as vehicles to carry out interventions in vulnerable communities.</p>



<p>Mr Forster stressed the importance of sustained engagement between policymakers and stakeholders to ensure stronger legal frameworks, adequate resources, and better protection for vulnerable populations.</p>



<p>Human trafficking remains a major national concern in Ghana, particularly involving women and children who are often subjected to forced labour and exploitation. Lawmakers say stronger collaboration between government agencies, civil society, and international partners will be critical to tackling the growing threat.</p>
