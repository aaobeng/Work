										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Academic City University has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the American University of Antigua College of Medicine (AUA) to expand opportunities for Ghanaian students seeking careers in medicine.</p>



<p>The American University of Antigua College of Medicine (AUA) is an innovative medical school dedicated to providing a learner-centric education of the highest quality, granting opportunities to underrepresented minorities, fostering a diverse academic community, and ensuring that its graduates develop the skills and attitudes of lifelong learning, compassion, and professionalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The agreement between Academic City and AUA aims to strengthen academic collaboration between the two institutions and to create clear pathways for students to access medical education and training abroad.</p>



<p>Under the partnership, graduates of Academic City University who meet the required admission criteria will be granted guaranteed admission into AUA’s Doctor of Medicine (MD) programme. Beneficiaries will also enjoy a waiver of the application fee, an expedited admissions process and a waiver of the pre-registration seat deposit upon acceptance.</p>



<p>The collaboration further provides financial support to help reduce the cost of medical education. Eligible Academic City graduates admitted into the MD programme will qualify for a $5,000 Preferred Programme Grant, to be paid in instalments during the pre-clinical phase of the programme. AUA is expected to award up to 15 such grants annually across its three academic intakes.</p>



<p>In addition to the grant, students may be considered for other scholarships and awards, including those that promote diversity within the medical profession.</p>



<p>Commenting on the agreement, the Vice-President for Institutional Advancement at Academic City University, Dr Lucy Agyepong, said the partnership would deepen international academic cooperation and open up more opportunities for students to contribute meaningfully to the health sector in Ghana and beyond.</p>



<p>She added that the agreement also encourages academic exchange through the sharing of faculty expertise, research opportunities and learning resources.</p>



<p>“At Academic City University, we remain committed to providing student-centred education and strengthening pathways for students to pursue professional careers in healthcare,” she added.</p>



<p>AUA President, Dr Peter Bell, stated that “American University of Antigua is looking forward to welcoming students from Academic City University, Ghana, to our program. </p>



<p>The collaboration between both institutions will provide qualified students with the opportunity to become physicians well prepared to provide care to diverse patient populations in a global setting.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Cadillac’s arrival on the Formula 1 grid in 2026 marks one of the most significant moments for American manufacturers in modern Grand Prix racing. You will also have <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">the opportunity to <a href="https://1xbet.sl/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">win your online sports bets</a> at 1xBet based on the performances of this squad</span>.</p>



<p>Backed by General Motors (GM) and operated in partnership with TWG Motorsports, the Cadillac F1 Team will become the sport’s 11th team. This ends a long and politically complex entry process that began under the Andretti banner and evolved into a full Cadillac-branded project. If you enjoy Formula 1, then you will definitely want to win with your online sports betting made on it at the 1xBet website.</p>



<p>Formula 1 and the FIA officially approved Cadillac’s entry in March 2025, confirming that the team met 3 kinds of requirements:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>sporting;</li>



<li>financial;</li>



<li>and technical.</li>
</ul>



<p>The project is headquartered in the United Kingdom under the name Cadillac Formula Racing, which now serves as the operational hub after the Andretti name was phased out from the F1 effort. Veteran F1 executive Graeme Lowdon was appointed team principal, while Dan Towriss, CEO of TWG Motorsports, plays a central leadership role.</p>



<p>Partnering with Ferrari<strong></strong></p>



<p>For its debut, Cadillac will use Ferrari-supplied power units, a common strategy for new teams to ensure reliability and competitiveness while building long-term infrastructure. A <a href="https://1xbet.sl/en/line/football" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simple bet on football</a> and on Formula 1 is definitely best made at the 1xBet platform.</p>



<p>GM’s long-term ambition, however, is to become a full works team by developing its own Cadillac-branded power unit in the coming years through TWG GM Performance Power Units. This aligns with Formula 1’s new 2026 technical regulations, which place greater emphasis on electrical power and sustainable fuels. A bet on football, Formula 1 or many other disciplines can be made in a simple manner at 1xBet, which you can join today.</p>



<p>Getting ready for the great occasion<strong></strong></p>



<p>Cadillac has also made headlines with a high-profile Super Bowl campaign in early 2026, unveiling its car livery and signalling its intent to connect with a broader U.S. audience. The team is set to debut at the Australian Grand Prix in March 2026. While waiting for other F1 Grand Prix events, you can also <a href="https://1xbet.sl/en/slots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play profitable online slots</a> with 1xBet.</p>



<p>They will enter a highly competitive field, but with significant financial backing and technical recruitment from across the paddock. The initial driver lineup includes experienced race winners Sergio Pérez and Valtteri Bottas, underlining Cadillac’s desire to be competitive from the outset rather than simply making up the numbers. Some profitable online slots are available to play at 1xBet before a major Formula 1 event.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The year 2025 will be remembered as one of the strongest periods for Ghanaian equities in recent history. </p>



<p>The Ghana Stock Exchange Composite Index returned 79.4%, powered by broad-based gains across listed companies and renewed investor confidence in equities amid easing inflation and stabilising interest rates. </p>

<p>Yet within this exceptional market environment, performance dispersion still mattered. While the tide lifted many boats, only a few strategies demonstrated the discipline and adaptability required to consistently translate market momentum into investor outcomes. Among them was the InvestCorp Active Equity Fund (IAEF), which delivered a 78% return in 2025, placing it among the best-performing equity funds in the market. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="816" height="1024" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-816x1024.png" alt=" The InvestCorp Active Equity Fund " class="wp-image-10032983078" title=" The InvestCorp Active Equity Fund " srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-816x1024.png 816w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-239x300.png 239w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-768x964.png 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-112x140.png 112w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-100x125.png 100w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-199x250.png 199w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-120x150.png 120w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-338x424.png 338w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961-40x50.png 40w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1961.png 1020w" sizes="(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px" /></figure>



<p><strong>A Disciplined Approach in a Strong Market&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>IAEF’s performance was not due to passive market exposure. Managed by InvestCorp Asset Management Limited, a wholly Ghanaian-owned investment firm, the Fund follows a research-driven, active investment philosophy that responds to changing market conditions rather than a passive approach. </p>



<p>Established in <strong>February 2019 </strong>and regulated by the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>, the Fund provides investors with exposure to both <strong>domestic and international equities</strong>, with the flexibility to allocate <strong>up to 40% of assets to foreign stocks</strong>. This structure allows the portfolio to benefit from local market strength while diversifying risk through selective global opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although equity-focused, the Fund retains the ability to allocate modestly to fixed-income instruments for liquidity management and short-term risk mitigation — a feature that proved valuable during periods of market rotation.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Performance That Built Confidence&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The Fund’s <strong>78% return in 2025 </strong>built on an already strong <strong>35% performance in 2024</strong>, reinforcing a pattern of consistent execution rather than a one-off outcome. Importantly, performance over the year was <strong>steady</strong>, reflecting disciplined portfolio construction and active rebalancing across both local and global holdings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For investors who remained invested throughout the year, the <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong>cumulative return by December was 78%</strong></span>, highlighting the benefits of patience and long-term positioning during a favourable equity cycle. </p>



<p><strong>Standing Out Among Peers&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>While the broader equity market delivered strong <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">returns, IAEF’s performance <strong>outpaced most peers</strong></span>, reflecting its ability to generate alpha through active management. Rather than relying solely on market momentum, the Fund’s strategy emphasised stock selection, timing, and diversification — factors that contributed meaningfully to relative performance during the year. </p>

<p><strong>Positioning for the Year Ahead&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Looking toward <strong>2026</strong>, the investment landscape is expected to remain supportive of equities. <strong>Fixed income yields remain low</strong>, encouraging continued reallocation toward risk assets, while <strong>easing inflation and stable interest rates </strong>provide a constructive backdrop for corporate earnings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Against this backdrop, IAEF is positioned to pursue opportunities across both the <strong>Ghanaian equity market and selected global exposures</strong>, including U.S. equities. This dual-market approach allows the Fund to participate in domestic growth while tapping into resilient global sectors, enhancing diversification and strengthening long-term return potential.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Case for IAEF&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The experience of 2025 reinforced a fundamental investment lesson: <strong>strong markets reward participation, but exceptional outcomes require judgment</strong>. The InvestCorp Active Equity Fund’s performance and growth over the past year illustrate what disciplined active management can achieve when combined with diversification, risk awareness, and execution. </p>



<p>As investors assess opportunities for the year ahead, strategies that remain flexible, research-led, and globally aware are likely to remain well-positioned in an increasingly complex investment environment. </p>



<p><strong><em>NB: Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>The Dean of the Faculty of Accounting and Finance at the University of Professional Studies, Accra (UPSA), Prof Isaac Boadi, has called for a shift from political sloganeering to practical economic implementation, insisting that “good economics or a good economy begins where slogans end”.</p>



<p>Speaking on JoyNews’ AM Show on Friday, 20 February, he questioned what he described as a growing reliance on catchy policy labels without clearly defined implementation frameworks.</p>



<p>“I think we should be tired of slogans as a country. A policy you want to legislate — you want to legislate night work without pricing the night — is it not a problem?” he asked.</p>



<p>Referring to the recently assented 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill, 2025, Prof Boadi argued that policy proposals must be supported by thorough financial planning.</p>



<p>“You want to legislate night work, but then you find it difficult to price that night. Check the entire document well; there is Build 24, Grow 24, Show 24, Connect 24, and many others,” he said.</p>



<p>While acknowledging that the ambition behind such initiatives may be commendable, he maintained that the focus must move beyond branding.</p>



<p>“As a good economy begins where slogans end, we should be tired of this nomenclature and start the implementation properly,” he stated.</p>



<p>Prof Boadi also raised concerns about the financial viability of the programme, particularly reports that it would require $4 billion over the next five years.</p>



<p>“You want to do a programme; now we have been told they need $4 billion for the next five years. Do we have the money now?” he questioned.</p>



<p>“I am only asking questions because of one policy. Look at the nomenclatures given over the period; now we have decided to add a ‘plus’ to it. It started before the election period; we were all laughing in the country: ‘nkoko nkitikiti’, 24-hour economy, and all those names.”</p>



<p>He cautioned that attaching popular labels to policy initiatives without clear funding sources and timelines could create implementation challenges.</p>



<p>“When you add that to a policy, you have a problem from the implementation phase. I will be happy on any day that this materialises, because you are not targeting only employment but productivity, which is key,” he noted.</p>



<p>Prof Boadi stressed that policies aimed at addressing youth unemployment and boosting productivity would naturally attract public support — but only if they are grounded in realism.</p>



<p>“Look at the youth in our country; when you want to come out with a policy that will address the needs of the ordinary Ghanaian, why won’t we be happy? But the point is that the dreamer should be able to have timelines and the cost plan available,” he said.</p>



<p>“You tell me you need $4 billion; where is the source of the funds? Where is it going to come from? We have shifted several goalposts; now we have left the policy. It’s going to be driven by the ordinary person; the government will provide the platform for you, and now you will come in and fill the gap. From the beginning, that was not the concept that we knew; it has changed.”</p>



<p>His comments come after President John Dramani Mahama formally assented to the 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill, 2025, on Thursday, during a brief ceremony ahead of the 13th Cabinet meeting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President of the Ghana Football Association (GFA), Kurt Okraku, has expressed concern over the injury crisis in the Black Stars team ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. </p>



<p>Otto Addo&#8217;s side has been hit with injuries to key members of the team, with the tournament a few months away. </p>



<p>Mohammed Salisu has been ruled out of the global showpiece after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACL), while Abu Francis, Mohammed Kudus and a few others are on the treatment table at their various clubs.</p>



<p>Anxiety amongst Ghanaian fans continues to grow regarding the situation, and Kurt is no different to those sentiments.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m concerned, and everybody is concerned about the number of players in the medical room as you speak now. But I’m very positive. I’m a very positive person,&#8221; he said in an interview with the GFA Media team.</p>



<p>&#8220;I always believe that everything and anything is possible, and our job is to work as much as we can. Our job is to pray as much as we can for the Almighty God to bless us, and we leave the rest to him.</p>



<p>&#8220;We’ll do our part, and we know that our part will be enough to make Ghana proud.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Black Stars are expected to commence their preparations for the World Cup next month when they face Austria and Germany in two high-profile friendly games.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Exactly two weeks from today, Ghana will be celebrating the 69th anniversary of its independence from Great Britain in 1957. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Exactly two weeks from today, Ghana will be celebrating the 69th anniversary of its independence from Great Britain in 1957. &nbsp;</p>



<p>But Ghana’s independence story goes much further back than 1957. &nbsp;It started in 1951, specifically, on 20th February, when Kwame Nkrumah’s Convention People’s Party (CPP) swept into power under “limited self-government,” having won 34 of the 38 seats in the general election in a complex political arrangement that also seated many independents as well as representatives from various groups in the Legislative Assembly. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Today marks the 75th anniversary of that momentous occasion, which eventually resulted in full independence in 1957, accelerating or triggering other independence movements across Africa. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Nkrumah became the “leader of government business,” a dubious title that belittled the significance of the moment and had to be replaced, after much protest by the CPP, with the more fitting title of “prime minister” in 1952.</p>



<p>With an additional portfolio of Minister of Development, he began the Herculean task of transforming an economy hollowed by centuries of external exploitation and primed for liberation and reconstruction.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Achievements</h2>



<p>Thus began the prelude to Ghana’s full independence, a period characterised by some of the greatest achievements of Nkrumah in his 15 years in office (from 1951 to 1966), achievements that tend to get overshadowed by stories of independence that begin from 1957. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, a recent report on human capital development policies in Ghana started with educational policies after 1957, but the bigger story of education under Nkrumah in fact began in 1952, with his Accelerated Education Programme.</p>



<p>This programme made primary education free for the first time in the Gold Coast, to be followed by the Education Act of 1961, which made primary education compulsory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And it wasn’t just access to education that increased; there was a boom in education infrastructure at all levels as well, among the most notable being Opoku Ware Secondary School (in collaboration with the Catholic Church) and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, which for decades had the only Olympic-size swimming pool in Ghana. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The famous Akosa Primary School at Suntreso, in Kumasi, was named after the father of the now-world-renowned pathologist, Prof Agyemang Badu Akosa, who was a CPP commissioner at Sekyere District in Ashanti.</p>



<p>The Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (or Gee, named after the contractors who built it) was also constructed in Kumasi in 1954, as was the Ashanti Regional Library at Bantama.</p>



<p>These and other major accomplishments in Ashanti disprove the charge later hurled against Nkrumah by his adversaries that he had squandered the cocoa wealth from Ashanti on other parts of the country to the neglect of Ashanti.</p>



<p>Indeed, Ashanti saw its fastest socio-economic development at any time during the tenure of Nkrumah, becoming a major beneficiary of the 600 factories that Nkrumah built across the country.</p>



<p>As a result of this record, Nkrumah also drew strong political support from Ashanti, with the CPP winning eight seats (compared to the National Liberation Movement’s 12) in the 1956 election, and sweeping 43 per cent of the total vote, despite a wave of violence against its supporters in the lead-up to the election.</p>



<p>The year 1952 also saw the first local government council elections, where the CPP won nearly 90 per cent of the 270 seats, laying the groundwork for the popular participation that would propel it to a massive victory again in the 1956 election that brought full independence to Ghana the following year, with the CPP sweeping 71 out of 104 seats.  </p>



<p>While much has been written about Nkrumah’s Seven-Year Development Plan (1963-1970), very little is known of his first (five-year) development plan (1951 to 1956), during which the implementation of the ambitious Volta River Scheme, for example, led to the construction of Tema Township and the Tema Harbour; the Akosombo dam; the Volta Lake (the largest man-made lake in the world), and the Adomi Bridge, the first suspension bridge in the Gold Coast, whose construction began in 1955.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Big dreams &nbsp;</h2>



<p>To power his ambitious programme of rapid industrialisation and economic transformation, Nkrumah also restructured the Industrial Development Corporation in 1955 from a small-loans-disbursing outfit hurriedly set up in the dying days of colonialism into a more proactive one with a mandate that included “the investigation, formulation and carrying out of projects for developing industries in the Gold Coast.”</p>



<p>Particular attention was paid to “industries which will make use of local materials”. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There were many challenges, of course.</p>



<p>Land disputes were, as they are now, a major obstacle to development, particularly the establishment of new industries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This forced Nkrumah to propose “industrial estates” for “all firms which seek new premises or the use of public services,” according to the Industrial Development Committee Reports and Accounts of 1954-5.</p>



<p>The 1966 coup undid much of the success of the initiative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Equally crucial at the time was the shortage of business capital and the skills in both the public and private sectors to drive industrialisation, leading Nkrumah in 1954 to issue a policy statement welcoming foreign direct investment on condition that it brought with it new and better ways for manufacturing (knowledge and technology transfer) as well as the training of Africans for technical and managerial positions.</p>



<p>These particular challenges eventually led to the establishment in 1961 of the Institute of Public Administration (known today as the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration, GIMPA) and, three years later, the National Productivity Institute (known today as the Management Development and Productivity Institute) under the National Planning Commission.</p>



<p>The first institute was to build the capacity of the public sector, while the second one aimed at boosting efficiency in the productive sector, including state-owned enterprises.</p>



<p>It was the beginning of a productivity revolution, a precondition for raising the living standards of Ghanaians, which defined the legacy of Nkrumah until his tragic overthrow.  </p>



<p>The story of Ghana’s independence is meaningless unless it is linked to the total realisation of what happened before 1957.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dean of the Faculty of Accounting and Finance at the University of Professional Studies, Accra, Prof Isaac Boadi, says the government’s 24-Hour Economy policy could significantly boost Ghana’s productivity and attract investment — but only if it is properly implemented.</p>



<p>Speaking on JoyNews’ AM Show on 20 February, Prof Boadi described the signing of the 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill by President John Dramani Mahama on Thursday as “symbolically powerful”.</p>



<p>He said the move sends a strong signal to investors beyond Ghana’s borders that the country is serious about expanding economic activity and creating opportunities.</p>



<p>“The signing yesterday had an investor signalling. Beyond our borders, those investors who heard this yesterday will be preparing by now what is going to happen in this country,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Boadi noted that the policy targets sectors such as manufacturing, agribusiness, agro-processing, health, retail, transportation and hospitality. He explained that these sectors depend heavily on time-sensitive operations, where efficiency and continuous activity are critical.</p>



<p>According to him, Ghana is currently operating below its productive capacity, with many institutions and services closing early or functioning below full potential. He argued that initiatives such as the 24-Hour Economy are essential to expanding output, creating jobs and addressing youth unemployment.</p>



<p>However, he cautioned that legislation alone will not deliver meaningful economic transformation.</p>



<p>“Economic transformation is not produced by legislation alone. It’s produced by incentives, infrastructure and institutions,” he stressed.</p>



<p>He warned that without proper planning, funding and execution, even well-intentioned policies could fail.</p>



<p>Prof Boadi also raised concerns about financing, noting that the government has indicated it would require $4 billion over the next five years to implement the programme.</p>



<p>“You want to do a programme… do you have the money now?” he asked, emphasising that financial readiness is critical to turning policy into tangible results.</p>



<p>The academic further observed that the original concept of the 24-Hour Economy appears to have evolved. Initially presented as government-driven, he said it now seems to rely more heavily on private sector participation, with the government providing a platform for businesses to fill gaps. He cautioned that such shifts could create uncertainty and undermine confidence in the policy.</p>



<p>Prof Boadi also questioned claims that some public institutions are already operating on a 24-hour basis, describing these as routine shift systems rather than full implementation of the policy.</p>



<p>“When you go to DVLA or the passport office, and they say they are operating a 24-hour economy, under which law?” he asked, adding that practical considerations — including pricing and staffing for night operations — must be clearly addressed.</p>



<p>Despite his reservations, Prof Boadi said he would welcome the initiative if it succeeds in boosting productivity and tackling youth unemployment.</p>



<p>“I would be happy any day this materialises,” he said, urging the government to move beyond slogans such as “Grow 24”, “Make 24” and “Build 24”, and focus on execution.</p>



<p>He reiterated that for the 24-Hour Economy to deliver real impact, legislation must be complemented by incentives, infrastructure investment and strong institutions to ensure long-term sustainability.</p>



<p>“Good economics begins where slogans end,” he added.</p>



<p>The 24-Hour Economy remains one of the government’s flagship strategies, aimed at increasing productivity, expanding exports and creating employment. Its success, however, will depend on effective implementation, adequate funding and robust institutional support to ensure the benefits reach ordinary Ghanaians and attract both local and international investors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ghana’s insurance industry has reaffirmed its readiness to fully underwrite marine and aviation cargo risks as government moves to strictly enforce compulsory domestic marine cargo insurance for all commercial imports effective February 1, 2026.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana’s insurance industry has reaffirmed its readiness to fully underwrite marine and aviation cargo risks as government moves to strictly enforce compulsory domestic marine cargo insurance for all commercial imports effective February 1, 2026.</p>



<p>The assurance comes from Mercy Naa Koshie Boampong, Chief Executive Officer of Serene Insurance and Second Vice-President and Chairperson of the Ghana Insurers Association (GIA).</p>



<p>Mrs Boampong firmly rejected suggestions that local insurers lack the technical expertise or financial strength to handle large-scale marine cargo risks. She described marine cargo insurance as a well-established and mature line of business within Ghana’s insurance market, not a new product being introduced solely because of enforcement.</p>



<p>“Marine cargo insurance has existed in Ghana for decades. The industry has the structures, underwriting capacity and systems required to manage complex and high-value risks,” she stated.</p>



<p>Strong Capital Base and Global Reinsurance Support</p>



<p>According to Mrs Boampong, Ghanaian insurers operate with solid capital bases and experienced underwriting teams, supported by structured access to international reinsurance markets.</p>



<p>She emphasised that every marine risk underwritten locally is backed by reinsurance arrangements that distribute exposure across global partners. Through reinsurance and retrocession mechanisms, local insurers are able to share high-value risks internationally, ensuring that claims can be settled without financial strain.</p>



<p>“Every risk underwritten locally is supported by reinsurance. This global risk-sharing framework guarantees additional security for importers and the economy,” she said.</p>



<p>Enforcement to Retain Premiums in Ghana</p>



<p>The renewed enforcement is being implemented under Section 222 of the Insurance Act, 2021 (Act 1061), in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance, Bank of Ghana, National Insurance Commission (NIC) and Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA).</p>



<p>Although the legal requirement for domestic marine cargo insurance has existed since 2006, compliance has been limited. Data from the NIC indicate that only about six percent of Ghana’s imports are currently insured locally. Industry estimates suggest that nearly US$100 million in marine insurance premiums is paid annually to foreign insurers.</p>



<p>Mrs Boampong noted that Ghana’s insurance sector currently has significant unused underwriting capacity due to continued offshore placement of cargo insurance.</p>



<p>“With effective enforcement, this existing capacity can now be fully utilised to protect Ghanaian importers while retaining premium income within the local economy,” she said.</p>



<p>Significant Economic Impact</p>



<p>The potential economic impact is substantial. In 2024, Ghana processed approximately 13.7 million metric tonnes of cargo through its ports, with total merchandise imports valued at about US$15.2 billion. These imports including petroleum products, grains, edible oils, frozen foods and heavy machinery—require comprehensive marine cargo coverage.</p>



<p>Daniel F. Yeboah, Head of Insurance and Pensions at the Ministry of Finance, has indicated that full implementation of the policy could generate nearly GH₵300 million annually for the domestic insurance industry.</p>



<p>Industry analysts believe consistent enforcement could strengthen capital accumulation within the insurance sector, deepen underwriting expertise and enhance linkages between insurance and trade finance.</p>



<p>Industry Ready for Full Implementation</p>



<p>Mrs Boampong maintained that Ghana’s insurers are fully prepared to assume the responsibility.</p>



<p>“The Ghanaian insurance industry is ready. Serene Insurance is ready. The financial backing, technical competence and international partnerships are already in place,” she affirmed.</p>



<p>With enforcement set to take effect, stakeholders view the policy as a critical step toward safeguarding Ghana’s import trade, strengthening domestic financial institutions and retaining significant insurance premiums within the national economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Several countries which have signed up to Donald Trump&#8217;s Board of Peace have contributed more than $7bn (£5.2bn) towards a Gaza &#8220;relief package&#8221;, the US president has said.</p>



<p>Trump made the announcement during the first meeting of the organisation that many of US&#8217;s Western allies have refused to join, fearing the body originally meant to help end the war between Israel and Hamas may be intended to replace the UN.</p>



<p>The second phase of a US-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan includes the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza.</p>



<p>It &#8220;looks like&#8221; Hamas would disarm, Trump told participants. However, there are few signs of the Palestinian group disarming. Gazans say it is extending its control over the Strip.</p>



<p>Speaking as the Board of Peace convened on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had &#8220;agreed with our ally the US there will be no reconstruction of Gaza before the demilitarisation of Gaza&#8221;.</p>



<p>The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed, and 251 others were taken hostage.</p>



<p>Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 72,000 people have been killed, according to the territory&#8217;s Hamas-run health ministry.</p>



<p>The enclave&#8217;s economy is in ruins, with its buildings and infrastructure largely destroyed. The UN estimates the cost of damage at $70bn.</p>



<p>Countries including the UK, Canada, France and Germany have refused to join the Board of Peace that came into being last month.</p>



<p>In an effort to address concerns that the organisation was meant as a way of sidelining the UN, Trump told the board&#8217;s first meeting in Washington that &#8220;we&#8217;re going to be working with the United Nations very closely, we&#8217;re going to bring them back&#8221;.</p>



<p>Gaza, the US president said, was &#8220;no longer a hotbed of radicalism and terror&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;And to end that, we have today, and I&#8217;m pleased to announce that Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, UAE, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, and Kuwait have all contributed more than $7bn toward the relief package&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every dollar spent is an investment in stability,&#8221; he said, adding that the UN would contribute $2bn for humanitarian assistance, while football body Fifa would raise $75m for soccer-related projects in the Strip.</p>



<p>Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician who has been given the title of high representative for Gaza as part of the board, said the process of recruiting a new transitional Palestinian police force had begun and &#8220;just in the first few hours we have 2,000 people who have applied&#8221;.</p>



<p>But both Israel and the US have insisted that the force is not drawn from the existing Hamas-controlled police without stringent vetting, nor do they want it simply made up of the security forces of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.</p>



<p>That means starting from scratch, and the task is daunting.</p>



<p>Mladenov has previously said the Palestinian police force must be the primary security agency in Gaza, assisted by the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), and not vice-versa.</p>



<p>According to the US plan, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas.</p>



<p>But there is little evidence such a force could yet oversee the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian factions.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, there was no indication at the meeting that Hamas was prepared to hand over its weapons, despite Trump&#8217;s combination of optimism and threat on this point.</p>



<p>So far, Hamas has publicly appeared to make handing over weapons contingent on &#8211; at least &#8211; Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p>



<p>Progress on this issue is critical because none of Trump&#8217;s proposals for reconstruction and governance can take place without a security force on the ground that has broad backing of the Palestinian population, given its role includes assuming a monopoly of force within Gaza.</p>



<p>The Washington meeting itself was characteristic of Trump&#8217;s approach to Israeli Palestinian peace-making over his two terms &#8211; involving a future for Palestinians seen often through the lens of real-estate development and wealthy investor funding.</p>



<p>Meanwhile Israel&#8217;s leadership has been wary about some of Trump&#8217;s efforts, particularly the invitations to his board for Turkey and Qatar, whom Israel does not want to see take a prominent role in decisions on the future of Gaza.</p>



<p>Trump and his team have defended his unconventional approach saying it amounts to &#8220;new thinking&#8221; to try to solve the conflict.</p>



<p>However, Mladenov has warned that without rapid progress, Gaza will remain split into two territories, one under continuing Israeli occupation and the other under Hamas control &#8211; and also split from the West Bank, making a future independent state unviable and failing to secure either Palestinians or Israelis.</p>

<p>Bolt Food has reiterated the importance of regulatory compliance for food service businesses operating on its platform, encouraging merchant partners in Ghana to ensure they hold valid Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) Hygiene Permits in line with national food safety regulations.</p>



<p>The reminder follows recent guidance from the FDA indicating that food establishments operating without valid hygiene permits risk enforcement actions, including closure.</p>



<p>Bolt Food noted that the communication forms part of its ongoing efforts to support food safety, protect public health, and promote responsible platform operations across Ghana.</p>



<p>Bolt Food encouraged restaurant and food service partners to confirm that their hygiene permits are valid and up to date, begin renewal or application processes where necessary, and keep documentation readily available for inspection.</p>



<p>The company emphasised that compliance not only supports regulatory alignment but also helps build customer trust and long-term business sustainability for merchants.</p>



<p>Speaking on the initiative, Bolt Food emphasised that its role as a platform includes supporting merchants with clear and timely communication around regulatory requirements, while maintaining high safety standards for consumers.</p>



<p>“Food safety is a shared responsibility across the entire ecosystem,” said Bolt Food General Manager, Ali Zaryab. “By encouraging our merchant partners to comply with FDA hygiene permit requirements, we are supporting safer food handling practices, protecting consumers, and helping merchants operate sustainably within Ghana’s regulatory framework.”</p>



<p>Bolt Food reaffirmed its commitment to working collaboratively with merchants and regulators to promote high hygiene standards and ensure a safe, reliable food delivery experience for customers across Ghana.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>From Italy to Germany, from Greece to Türkiye, from Belgium to France, Ricardo Faty’s playing career has taken him to quite a few different stops. But today, he’s back where it started: the Institut national du football de Clairefontaine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Born in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, France, on August 4, 1986, Faty was raised by a Senegalese-Vietnamese father and a Cape Verdean mother in the Parisian suburbs, where he got his first big break with Clairefontaine from 1999 to 2002. Faty then left his hometown and made the move to Strasbourg, where he spent three years before breaking into the first team in 2005/06. He would play 15 times for Strasbourg – one of which came vs. Roma – before earning a move to Roma, who took advantage of his lack of a professional contract and Strasbourg’s relegation and signed him for €350,000.</p>



<p>Faty would showcase his skills in Italy, excelling against the likes of Lyon, Manchester United, and Milan, and even man-marking 1999 Ballon d’Or winner Rivaldo out of the match on his UEFA Champions League debut. He made 15 appearances and helped Roma end a six-year trophy drought by winning the Coppa Italia, but he was unable to dislodge the likes of Daniele De Rossi, Simone Perotta, and David Pizarro from the starting line-up. It’s why he decided to join <a href="https://bookmaker-ratings.ru/match/football/bundesliga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bundesliga</a> side Bayer Leverkusen on a two-year loan, only to depart after six months and move to French side Nantes, where he experienced both promotion and relegation.</p>



<p>He then spent two years in Greece with Aris Salonica before joining French outfit AC Ajaccio in 2012; that same year, Faty would switch over from France to Senegal, playing five times for the Lions of Teranga. Whilst his progress was interrupted by an Achilles injury, Faty nevertheless made 50 appearances for Ajaccio before departing for Standard Liége following the club’s relegation. He spent a year in Belgium before making the move to Türkiye, where he spent five years with Burasaspor and MKE Ankaragücü, followed by a spell with Serie B outfit Reggina and a swan song with C&#8217;Chartres Football in the French fourth tier. Since retiring in 2023, Faty has balanced his time between raising his three daughters in Paris (his son is playing high school basketball in Providence, Rhode Island) and working as a pundit for major French television and radio outlets. And similarly to other retired players like <a href="https://r.org/2026/01/17/those-days-will-never-come-back-felipe-martins-ready-for-new-post-playing-journey/">Felipe Martins</a>, he’s made a smooth transition into coaching and is now coaching the next top boys and girls from the Île-de-France region in INF Clairefontaine.</p>



<p>Joy News spoke to Faty about a number of topics, including:</p>



<p><strong>You&#8217;ve been very outspoken about your experiences dealing with racism. I&#8217;m curious, do you think that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been distinct with you, the fact that you&#8217;ve been able to use your platform off the pitch to talk about one of society&#8217;s evils? And would you say that your experience with racism has differed from country to country?</strong></p>



<p>Okay, I&#8217;ll talk about my own experience. In my career, personally, I never experienced racism directly. But I was a witness of racism in every country I played, even in France. And the thing is, it’s human nature. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s like that. Maybe in some countries, it&#8217;s more present, but in every country, I’ve experienced some episode of racism. Maybe not in Türkiye: when I arrived in 2015, it was the start of the big bang of the social networks – Instagram, Twitter, and the first apparitions of cyberbullying –&nbsp; and in social media, you start to see some bananas and other stuff. But I’m not talking about virtual stuff, I’m talking about stuff on the pitch, face to face…I’ve never experienced that in Türkiye. But, in Greece, yes. In Italy, yes. In France, yes. Even in Belgium sometimes. Germany, no, but I only spent six months, so I can’t judge. This is a shame, because I’ve experienced that everywhere at a different level. Obviously, I’ve talked about it a lot with the French and Italian press, but the thing is, I’ve stopped talking about it because nothing has changed. Sometimes I speak face-to-face with some powerful people, like presidents or higher-ups from the federation and the league, I’ve held meetings with referees and said, ‘If you really want to put racism out of football, you should make a real statement so that nobody will say that again.’ It’s not enough to just close the stands or the stadium, because people won’t care; they’ll come back after the week. Like Samuel Eto’o said, you’ve got to hit their wallets, but they would never do that, because maybe they&#8217;re scared or afraid. Unfortunately, this is human nature: I think it will never stop.</p>



<p><strong>So you personally have never suffered racism in your playing career, but you&#8217;ve seen your teammates or other Black people suffer?</strong></p>



<p>I’ve seen Black people suffer racism, or I’ve seen someone talk badly about Black people. I’m light-skinned, so in certain countries, I’m not even considered Black, I’ll hear people being racist and will go, ‘What are you saying?’ They’re like, ‘But you’re not Black.’ I’ll say, ‘What, I’m white?’ They’ll say, ‘No, but this one is Black, you&#8217;re not Black. I say, ‘Okay, if you say so.’ This is the kind of thing, sometimes it&#8217;s just ignorance, and people aren’t educated enough about it. That’s why, sometimes, when I talk to a lot of people, they say that it&#8217;s not even racism, it&#8217;s ignorance. Sometimes, in the stands, it&#8217;s not even racism: people are just ignorant, they just want to put you out of the game, but I’m still not okay with that. That&#8217;s why they need education, but maybe the institutions, they don&#8217;t want that, they&#8217;re not okay with that…this is the sad truth.</p>



<p><strong>Lastly, after plying your trade in France, Italy, Germany, and Greece, what was it like making the move to Belgium?</strong></p>



<p>After my time in Ajaccio, I realized that it was time for me to move on because the team had suffered relegation to Ligue 2. To be honest, I wanted to stay in France, but I didn&#8217;t have a good offer that I liked, that I was attracted to, and Standard came with a premier project. I started to look down the team and everything, and what&#8217;s happening around the team, and I really enjoyed it. You know me, I always make my choices about the clubs, about the mentality, the supporters, and the project, and everything, the history of the team, so I liked it. Now, I was used to traveling, so I said, ‘Okay, now I&#8217;m turning 29, okay, let&#8217;s travel again.’ I decided to go to Belgium to discover a new league, a new country, a new stadium, and a new atmosphere. Honestly, I really enjoyed my time in Liège. I wish I could have stayed longer there, but I got into some trouble because the president was changing a lot, and the club was very unstable. After one year, they decided to sell me as I received an offer from Turkish club Bursaspor. I didn’t want to go, but they said, ‘Look, we need to change the strategy of the team, we’re focused on players who are 23/24 years old, whereas you&#8217;re 29. You should go there; even the contract in Türkiye is good, so consider this offer. After just one year, I left Liège for Bursaspor, but honestly, I enjoyed my time there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana has maintained its position as the world’s leading country in mobile money regulation, according to the Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) Mobile Money Regulatory Index (MMRI) 2025. Ghana achieved an overall score of 96.10 percent, from 95.06 percent in the previous year.</p>



<p>This milestone underscores Ghana’s leadership in creating a world-class regulatory environment that enables mobile money services to thrive, drive financial inclusion and foster innovation in the digital financial ecosystem.</p>



<p>According to the GSMA, the MMRI measures the effectiveness of mobile money regulatory frameworks across 90 countries.</p>



<p>This ranking reflects the country’s commitment to progressive policies and robust oversight in the mobile money ecosystem, ensuring consumer protection, and operational integrity, and positions the country as a global benchmark for regulatory excellence in digital financial services.</p>



<p>The Bank will continue to collaborate with relevant stakeholders in the implementation of policies aimed at sustaining Ghana’s progress toward a fully inclusive and digitally empowered economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The government of Ghana has formally notified the government of Togo of its decision to refer their maritime boundary dispute to international arbitration.</p>



<p>In a statement released on Friday, February 20, Minister for Government Communications, Felix Kwakye Ofosu, confirmed that Ghana will seek the delimitation of the offshore boundary under the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the global legal framework governing the use of the world’s oceans.</p>



<p>The development follows eight years of bilateral negotiations between the two West African neighbours, which have failed to yield a mutually agreed settlement. Officials said repeated efforts to reach a diplomatic resolution had not resulted in a definitive outcome.</p>



<p>&#8220;This follows attempts at negotiating a boundary which have gone on for the past eight years but have not resulted in an agreed outcome,&#8221; the statement read.</p>



<div data-wp-interactive="core/file" class="wp-block-file"><object data-wp-bind--hidden="!state.hasPdfPreview" hidden class="wp-block-file__embed" data="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TOGO-4-1.pdf" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%;height:600px" aria-label="Embed of TOGO 4 (1)."></object><a id="wp-block-file--media-949f3075-d00c-4a5c-8b5c-d0bc2ba48526" href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TOGO-4-1.pdf">TOGO 4 (1)</a><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/TOGO-4-1.pdf" class="wp-block-file__button wp-element-button" aria-describedby="wp-block-file--media-949f3075-d00c-4a5c-8b5c-d0bc2ba48526" download>Download</a></div>



<p>According to the statement, Ghana has opted for arbitration in a bid to prevent further escalation of incidents that have generated tensions between certain state institutions in both countries. </p>



<p>The government stressed that the move is intended to promote an amicable and rules-based resolution to the dispute.</p>



<p>By pursuing arbitration under UNCLOS, Ghana aims to secure a binding legal determination while preserving the longstanding cordial relations between Accra and Lomé.</p>



<p><strong>Second Recourse to Arbitration in a Decade</strong></p>



<p>This marks the second time in recent years that Ghana has turned to international adjudication to settle a maritime boundary dispute.</p>



<p>In 2014, Ghana initiated arbitration proceedings against neighbouring Côte d&#8217;Ivoire following disagreements over their offshore boundary in the Gulf of Guinea, particularly after significant oil discoveries in the area.</p>



<p>The case was heard by a Special Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), operating under UNCLOS. </p>



<p>In September 2017, the tribunal delivered a binding judgment largely upholding Ghana’s position and formally delimiting the maritime boundary along an equidistance line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Eric Dane, the actor best known for his roles on Grey&#8217;s Anatomy and Euphoria, has died less than a year after revealing he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). He was 53.</p>



<p>Dane starred as family patriarch Cal Jacobs on hit HBO teen drama show Euphoria. Before that, he was perhaps best known as Dr Mark Sloan, or &#8216;Dr McSteamy&#8217;, on medical drama Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.</p>



<p>The California-born actor was diagnosed in 2025 with ALS and spent the last few months raising awareness for the most common form of motor neurone disease (MND).</p>



<p>His family said in a statement: &#8220;With heavy hearts, we share that Eric Dane passed on Thursday afternoon following a courageous battle with ALS.&#8221;</p>



<p>Dane was married to fellow actress and model Rebecca Gayheart, with whom he had two children.</p>



<p>The statement said he spent his final days surrounded by friends and his devoted wife, and his two daughters, Billie and Georgia, &#8220;who were the center of his world&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;He will be deeply missed and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he&#8217;s received.&#8221;</p>

<p>The actor was born in San Francisco in 1972 and made his television debut in the Wonder Years in 1993.</p>



<p>Dane also went on to star as Jason Dean in fantasy drama series Charmed, and Captain Tom Chandler in action drama show The Last Ship, while appearing in films such as Marley &amp; Me, Valentine&#8217;s Day and Burlesque.</p>



<p>Dane&#8217;s Grey&#8217;s Anatomy co-stars led tributes to the late actor.</p>



<p>Kim Raver &#8211; who plays doctor Teddy Altman in the series &#8211; said: &#8220;During filming he&#8217;d get this twinkle in his eye and with a mischievous look, he would deliver with perfect comedic timing, a line of dialogue that would floor you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kevin McKidd, who plays trauma surgeon Owen Hunt, posted &#8220;rest in peace buddy&#8221; on Instagram.</p>



<p>Euphoria creator Sam Levinson told Variety: &#8220;I&#8217;m heartbroken by the loss of our dear friend.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Working with him was an honor. Being his friend was a gift,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Ashton Kutcher, who starred alongside him in 2010&#8217;s Valentine&#8217;s Day, also paid tribute on social media: &#8220;Miss you, buddy. Let&#8217;s keep fighting the fight to solve ALS.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nina Dobrev meanwhile said Dane &#8220;led with kindness and made everyone on our set feel seen&#8221;. The pair starred together in 2022&#8217;s Redeeming Love.</p>



<p>&#8220;He was warm, generous, prepared, and so passionate about what he did,&#8221; she wrote on Instagram. &#8220;ALS is a cruel and unforgiving disease. May his memory inspire more research, awareness, and progress toward a cure.&#8221;</p>



<p>Since sharing his diagnosis in April 2025, Dane often spoke publicly about living with the progressive condition.</p>



<p>In June, he told ABC&#8217;s Good Morning America that the diagnosis had made him &#8220;angry&#8221; because he had lost his father, who died by suicide, as child: &#8220;There&#8217;s a very good chance I&#8217;m going to be taken from my girls while they&#8217;re very young.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Management of the Greater Accra Regional Hospital has confirmed that a security officer on duty at the facility was assaulted in an incident that occurred earlier this week.</p>

<p>According to management, the young man had been instructed to relocate to the reception area because hospital regulations prohibit visitors from loitering at the ward entrance outside approved visiting hours.</p>



<p>He reportedly defied the directive, pushed the officer to the ground and physically assaulted him, causing the officer to lose consciousness.</p>



<p>Medical personnel on duty immediately intervened, and the officer remains on admission but is responding to treatment.</p>



<p>The case has been reported to the Ghana Police Service at the Adabraka District Police Command. The suspect has been arrested, and investigations are ongoing with a view to prosecution.</p>



<p>Hospital authorities stressed that violence against staff will not be tolerated, underscoring the vital role security officers play in safeguarding patients, visitors and healthcare workers.</p>



<p>The statement, signed by Juliana Haruna, Head of Public Relations, also appealed to the public to respect hospital protocols and cooperate with staff to maintain a safe and orderly environment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghanaian actor and director&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0">Fiifi Coleman</a>&nbsp;is set to stage a theatrical revival of the classic story&nbsp;<em>I Told You So</em>&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1">National Theatre of Ghana</a>&nbsp;in March 2026.</p>



<p>The production will run from March 5 to March 8, with multiple shows scheduled over the four-day period. Organisers say the play is expected to attract large audiences due to its cultural relevance and the star-studded cast.</p>



<p>The stage adaptation traces its roots to Ghana’s concert party tradition and later evolved into a film in 1970 directed by&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=2">Egbert Adjesu</a>. The film became a landmark in Ghanaian cinema, celebrated for its humour, satire and strong social commentary. The original story was inspired by the works of legendary dramatist&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=3">Bob Cole</a>&nbsp;and remains one of the most influential Ghanaian narratives.</p>



<p>The upcoming production is being mounted by Fiifi Coleman Productions in collaboration with the National Theatre. It seeks to reconnect audiences with Ghanaian cultural values while promoting local theatre and storytelling.</p>

<p>The play tells the story of Kobina Jones, a man who returns home after years abroad in search of love, identity and family. However, he encounters unexpected realities that challenge his expectations about relationships, culture and responsibility. The themes explored include love and marriage, family expectations, tradition and modernity, social responsibility and morality.</p>



<p>The production features a mix of veteran and contemporary performers, including highlife legend&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=4">Gyedu-Blay Ambolley</a>, veteran actor&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=5">Fred Amugi</a>, comedian&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=6">Clemento Suarez</a>, actor&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=7">Clement Bonney</a>, Ken Fiati, Wofa Kay and Deaconess Abokomah.</p>



<p>Veteran filmmaker&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=8">Kwaw Ansah</a>, who worked as a set designer on the original film, is also associated with the project and attended the media launch.</p>



<p>The production will blend drama, comedy and music, with Ambolley expected to bring a strong musical element to the performance. Organisers describe the play as both entertainment and cultural preservation, aimed at celebrating Ghanaian identity and values.</p>

<p>A High-Level Ministerial Meeting under the Regional Consultation on Political Participation and Leadership of Women and Youth in West Africa was held on February 19, as part of a four-day regional engagement hosted by the Government of Ghana through the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection in collaboration with the ECOWAS Gender Development Centre.</p>



<p>The programme, which began on February 17, forms part of the ECOWAS Anniversary Legacy Project aimed at promoting gender parity and inclusive governance across Member States.</p>



<p>The engagement brought together ministers and key stakeholders to deliberate on practical strategies to increase women and youth representation in political leadership and decision-making processes across the sub-region.</p>

<p>Welcoming participants, the Minister for Gender, Children and Social Protection, Dr. Agnes Naa Momo Lartey, described the consultation as both timely and necessary.</p>



<p>She observed that although women and youth make up the majority of West Africa’s population and continue to drive innovation and development, their presence in governance structures remains disproportionately low.</p>



<p>Dr Lartey reaffirmed Ghana’s commitment to advancing gender equality and youth empowerment in line with regional and international frameworks.</p>

<p>She highlighted national initiatives such as the Reset Agenda, the Affirmative Action (Gender Equity) Act, and the ongoing review of the National Gender and Youth Policies as targeted measures to dismantle structural and socio-cultural barriers to inclusive participation.</p>



<p>Chair of ECOWAS Ministers responsible for Gender, Isata Mahoi, described the consultation as a decisive call to action.</p>



<p>She urged Member States to strengthen affirmative action policies, pursue electoral reforms, and expand mentorship opportunities to position women and young people at the forefront of democratic leadership.</p>



<p>The meeting concluded with a renewed commitment to translate regional pledges into concrete national actions that foster inclusive governance and sustainable development across West Africa.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Rapper <a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0">Kwaw Kese</a>, born Emmanuel Kofi Botwe, says he was a top English and Fante student at Winneba Secondary School. </p>



<p>Speaking on&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=1">Joy Prime</a>’s Prime Time, the artiste reflected on his academic background, his ambition to become a lawyer and the musicians he would have represented if he had pursued a legal career.</p>



<p>“I wanted to be a lawyer,” Kwaw Kese said during the interview. He explained that although he excelled in languages, he had a challenge with one of his teachers.</p>



<p>“The only problem I had was with my French teacher. The French teacher didn’t have that aura, so whenever he was teaching, it became boring,” he said.</p>



<p>Kwaw Kese also drew attention after stating that he would have defended&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=2">Wendy Shay</a>&nbsp;in court. “I will defend Wendy Shay if I was a lawyer because her body is nice,” he said, adding that he would also represent other artistes, including&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=3">Shatta Wale</a>,&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=4">Stonebwoy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=5">Black Sherif</a>,&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=6">Gyakie</a>,&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=7">MzVee</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="chatgpt://generic-entity?number=8">Ms. Bell</a>.</p>



<p>Explaining his choice of Shatta Wale, the rapper said he relates to the dancehall artiste’s personality. “I would try and defend a crazy guy like Shatta Wale. He is stubborn and I would defend stubbornness perhaps Shatta Wale is my son,” he stated.</p>



<p>Beyond academics and career ambitions, Kwaw Kese described himself as a “traditionalist and herbalist,” highlighting his spiritual beliefs. “I pour libation. I communicate with ‘Otweduanpon Asaase Yaa,’” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A prisoner due to be deported from Britain to Ghana has absconded from custody for the second time in a week.</p>



<p>Daniel Boakye, 21, escaped police officers guarding him at a hospital in Lewisham, south-east London, on Sunday, only five days after fleeing from prison officers at a hospital in Isleworth, west London.</p>



<p>The convicted knifepoint robber and drill rapper, who was due to be deported to Ghana, remains at large.</p>



<p>Boakye, from Enfield, north London, was receiving treatment under guard at University Hospital Lewisham shortly after 3pm on Sunday when he fled police.</p>



<p>Officers pursued him through the corridors, but he evaded them and has not been found since.</p>



<p>On Tuesday last week, he was being treated at West Middlesex University Hospital when he escaped from the prison officers guarding him.</p>



<p>He was arrested the following day at an address in Thamesmead, south-east London.</p>



<p>Police arrested two women, aged 20 and 51, a girl, 17, and a man, 30, on suspicion of assisting an offender. They were later released on bail.</p>



<p>Boakye was jailed for six years and five months in July 2023 for being part of a gang that stole mobile phones at knife-point before using them to siphon £115,000 of cryptocurrency found on them.</p>



<p><strong>Stolen bank information</strong></p>



<p>Boakye, Justin Popoola, Nathan Mohalland and a 17-year-old who has not been named carried out the robberies between June 2021 and January 2022, forcing victims to hand over their passcodes by threatening them with knives.</p>



<p>Detectives tracked them down after they ordered takeaways to their home addresses using stolen bank information.</p>



<p>The Metropolitan Police is now looking into the circumstances of his second escape.</p>



<p>A force spokesman said: “We are searching for a 21-year-old man who absconded from Lewisham hospital at around 15:05hrs on Sunday, 15 February.</p>



<p>“Daniel Boakye was in police custody at the hospital receiving medical treatment when he fled. Officers gave chase but could not detain Boakye before he left the building.</p>



<p>“He is 21 years old, black, of medium height and slim build. He was wearing grey tracksuit bottoms and a dark Nike jacket when he absconded.</p>



<p>“Anyone who has any information about Boakye’s whereabouts is asked to contact police on 999 quoting CAD4005/15FEB. You can also call the independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 to remain anonymous.</p>



<p>“We are currently reviewing this incident to fully understand the events which unfolded.”</p>



<p>A spokesman for the Home Office said: “All foreign national offenders who receive a prison sentence in the UK are referred for deportation at the earliest opportunity.</p>



<p>“We will not allow foreign criminals and illegal migrants to exploit our laws. We are reforming human rights laws and replacing the broken appeals system so we can scale up deportations.”</p>

<p>At the heart of the committee’s mandate is to deliberate and engage extensively and identify areas of possible collaboration that will culminate in securing Ghana’s energy future and creating sustainable employment opportunities.</p>



<p>In his brief remarks at the unveiling ceremony, Onasis Rosely commended the CEO of GNPC and his management team for their receptiveness and commitment to the partnership, noting that the unveiling of the committee members solidifies the promises made during their initial meeting in 2025.</p>



<p>Onasis Rosely stated that, with Ghana setting its sights on achieving energy security and embarking on a massive industrialisation drive, collaboration and synergy among institutions within the energy sector cannot be overemphasised.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ghana Catholic Bishops’ Conference has raised alarm over the escalating crisis in Ghana’s cocoa sector, warning that delays in payments and reduced producer prices are pushing farmers into debt and hardship.</p>



<p>The bishops called for urgent intervention to prevent further economic and social fallout in rural communities.</p>



<p>According to the statement, farmers have been suffering for months due to unpaid deliveries of cocoa, with the situation compounded by recent reductions in the producer price.</p>



<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lw1UFHBWKrM497jCz7yhwFYCpm2NhhjR/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>



<p>“For months, many farmers have endured delays in payment, resulting in unpaid labour, disrupted schooling, mounting debt, and growing vulnerability to illegal mining,” the Conference noted.</p>



<p>The bishops stressed that Ghana’s cocoa farmers should not bear the brunt of structural and historical shortcomings in the sector.</p>



<p>“Equity and justice demand that accumulated surpluses from profitable years be used to support farmers in difficult times. Penalising them for circumstances beyond their control is morally indefensible,” they said.</p>



<p>The statement also highlighted Ghana’s declining position in the global cocoa market, with Ecuador, Nigeria, and Cameroon emerging as significant competitors.</p>



<p>Climate stress and land degradation from illegal mining were cited as additional threats to productivity and sustainability.</p>



<p>Bishop Matthew Kwasi Gyamfi, President of the Conference, called for immediate payment of arrears, transparent financial restructuring, and investment in youth and research.</p>



<p>“The rescue of Ghana’s cocoa industry is a moral duty. Justice for cocoa farmers is justice for Ghana,” he emphasised.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Gold Fields has confirmed it will formally relinquish ownership and operational control of the Damang Mine on April 18, 2026, following a government decision for the asset to transition to Ghanaian ownership.</p>



<p>The exit brings to a close a 12-month lease extension granted after the mine’s original lease expired in April 2025. The company said the extension was designed to ensure a “safe and seamless” transfer of the operation while discussions on its future were concluded.</p>



<p>Speaking during a media roundtable on the company’s 2025 full-year results on Thursday, Chief Executive Officer Mike Fraser disclosed that Gold Fields had applied for a renewal when the lease expired but the government opted for a different course.</p>



<p>“Our lease expired in April 2025. We applied for an extension, but the government indicated a preference for the asset to transition to Ghanaian ownership, which we accepted and thought made sense,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Fraser explained that since July 2025, a transition team appointed by the sector minister has been working alongside Gold Fields’ management at site to coordinate the handover process. However, he indicated that the company has not received formal communication regarding who will assume long-term operatorship once it exits.</p>



<p>The transition team is expected to assume interim “leadership and operatorship” from April 19, 2026, pending the appointment of a substantive operator by government.</p>



<p>“We do not have any clear insights into what the minister’s intentions are post that. A new operator would need to be appointed and issued with a mining lease to continue operations — a process that could require parliamentary approval,” he said.</p>



<p>Under Ghana’s mining framework, mineral assets revert to the state upon expiry of a lease, leaving government to determine the ownership and operating structure going forward.</p>



<p>As part of the conditions tied to the extension, Gold Fields completed a feasibility study on Damang and submitted it to the Minerals Commission, copying the sector minister at the end of 2025. The study suggests the mine could sustain operations for at least nine additional years, with projected annual production between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces.</p>



<p>According to the company’s internal assessment, extending the life of the mine would require capital investment estimated between US$500 million and US$600 million. Management indicated that, based on prevailing gold price assumptions, the operation would remain profitable over that period, although it cautioned that a new operator could adopt a different technical or commercial model.</p>



<p>Beyond the ownership transition, the question of operational continuity looms large. The Damang Mine directly employs about 500 staff, with an additional 1,000 to 1,500 contractors engaged in mining services, logistics and energy supply. In total, between 1,500 and 2,000 livelihoods are linked to the operation.</p>



<p>Mr Fraser stressed that both the government and the transition team appear aligned on avoiding disruption.</p>



<p>“Failure would occur if we don’t see a continuation of the asset,” he noted, explaining that the lease extension was structured specifically to prevent abrupt stoppages that could affect workers, contractors and host communities.</p>



<p>The Damang exit marks an adjustment within Gold Fields’ Ghana portfolio, coming at a time when the company is also engaging authorities over the renewal of its Tarkwa mining lease. </p>



<p>Attention now turns to how swiftly the government will appoint a successor operator and secure the necessary approvals to ensure uninterrupted production beyond April 2026 — a development that industry observers say will test policy execution and investor confidence in Ghana’s mining sector.</p>

<p>Ghanaian artist, Kweku Adu-Gyamfi Opoku, has officially launched his new book titled &#8216;Adi Nkyia&#8217; Book of Symbols, in Accra.</p>



<p>The event was held at the Ghana Club, near the Black Star Square, on Wednesday, February 18, 2026.</p>



<p>The 122-page book, dedicated to creative exploration and available on all major online bookstores, showcases a new collection of African art symbols developed by the author.</p>



<p>According to him, the symbols created are intended to connect ancestral wisdom with modern expression.</p>



<p>Adi Nhyia, unlike the popular Akan traditional ‘Adinkra’ symbols, meaning “farewell”, signifies “getting together and meeting the future”.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The National Labour Commission (NLC) has directed four striking tertiary education unions to continue engagements with the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission (FWSC), the sector ministry and the Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (GTEC) over outstanding salary arrears, Tier Two pension contributions and overtime allowances.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The National Labour Commission (NLC) has directed four striking tertiary education unions to continue engagements with the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission (FWSC), the sector ministry and the Ghana Tertiary Education Commission (GTEC) over outstanding salary arrears, Tier Two pension contributions and overtime allowances.</p>



<p>Under the directive, the parties have been given one month to report back to the NLC on progress made towards resolving the issues that triggered the industrial action.</p>



<p>The decision follows a meeting between the Commission, the four teacher unions and the respondents in an effort to address the grievances raised.</p>



<p>The unions involved are the Senior Staff Association–Universities of Ghana (SSA-UoG), the Teachers’ and Educational Workers’ Union of the Trades Union Congress (TEWU-TUC), the Federation of Universities Senior Staff Association of Ghana (FUSSAG), and the Technical Universities Administrators Association of Ghana (TUAAG).</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the unions have agreed to suspend the strike following an injunction secured by the Commission at the High Court.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Findings</h2>



<p>At the meeting, the Commission found that as of January 1, 2026, the migration of upgraded staff had been completed to address concerns relating to salary arrears.</p>



<p>It also established that part of the Tier Two contributions being complained of by the unions had been paid.</p>



<p>Additionally, the NLC noted that following migration onto the Single Spine Salary Structure (SSSS), allowances within the public service are negotiated by the Public Service Joint Standing Negotiating Committee (PSJSNC) under Categories Two and Three. Overtime pay falls within this category of allowances.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>



<p>Following the declaration of the strike by the teacher unions, the NLC summoned the four unions to appear before it for a hearing on the issues that led to the industrial action.</p>



<p>The summons was issued pursuant to Section 139 of the Labour Act, 2003 (Act 651).</p>



<p>This came after the NLC secured a High Court injunction against the strike.</p>



<p>In an order for interim injunction, the court, presided over by Justice Priscilla Dikro Ofori, described the strike as illegal and directed the unions to call it off with immediate effect.</p>



<p>The order, granted on February 13, 2026, followed an ex parte application by the Commission.</p>

<p>The Ghana Catholic Bishops’ Conference has called for immediate action to safeguard Ghana’s cocoa farmers amid mounting economic pressures.</p>



<p>The bishops expressed deep concern over delayed payments, declining producer prices, and the resulting hardships faced by rural communities dependent on cocoa farming.</p>



<p>The Conference noted that many farmers have suffered financial setbacks and social challenges as a result of unpaid cocoa deliveries.</p>



<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lw1UFHBWKrM497jCz7yhwFYCpm2NhhjR/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>



<p>“During years of windfall gains, producer prices were not raised proportionately. Farmers should not bear the full burden of systemic and historical failures,” the statement said.</p>



<p>Highlighting the need for equity, the bishops urged the government to stabilise producer prices and use accumulated surpluses to cushion farmers.</p>



<p>They also called for a depoliticised national dialogue focused on farmers’ welfare and the sector’s long-term sustainability.</p>



<p>The bishops warned that Ghana risks losing its competitive position in the global cocoa market.</p>



<p>“Ecuador is on course to overtake Ghana as the world’s second-largest cocoa producer, while Nigeria and Cameroon threaten to form a powerful third force.</p>



<p>These shifts, alongside climate stress and land degradation from illegal mining, place Ghana at a strategic crossroads,” the statement said.</p>



<p>Concluding the statement, Bishop Matthew Kwasi Gyamfi said, “Youth participation, research, and local processing must be prioritised to secure the sector’s future.</p>



<p>The rescue of Ghana’s cocoa industry is a moral imperative, not merely an economic task.”</p>



<p>The Conference has also shared a detailed pastoral letter on the cocoa crisis with former President John Dramani Mahama and the Leadership of Parliament for urgent consideration.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ghana Catholic Bishops’ Conference has issued an urgent appeal to the government and stakeholders to address the growing crisis in Ghana’s cocoa sector.</p>



<p>In a press statement today, the Conference warned that unpaid cocoa farmers face mounting debt, disrupted schooling, and increasing vulnerability to illegal mining activities.</p>



<p>The bishops highlighted the difficulties farmers have faced due to delayed payments for cocoa already delivered.</p>



<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lw1UFHBWKrM497jCz7yhwFYCpm2NhhjR/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>



<p>“For months, many farmers have endured delays in payment, resulting in unpaid labour, disrupted schooling, mounting debt, and growing vulnerability to illegal mining,” the statement said.</p>



<p>The reduction in producer prices, they noted, has worsened the situation, eroding confidence in the sector.</p>



<p>The Conference stressed that farmers should not bear the full weight of systemic challenges.</p>



<p>“Equity and justice demand that accumulated surpluses from years of windfall gains be used to cushion farmers in difficult years. To penalise them for circumstances beyond their control would be insensitive and morally indefensible,” the statement said.</p>



<p>The bishops also warned of Ghana’s weakening global cocoa position, pointing to Ecuador, Nigeria, and Cameroon as rising competitors.</p>



<p>They cited climate stress and land degradation from illegal mining as compounding factors threatening the sector’s stability.</p>



<p>The Conference called for immediate remedial measures, including payment of arrears, transparent restructuring of the Ghana Cocoa Board, sustained producer prices, and greater youth participation in cocoa production.</p>



<p>Bishop Matthew Kwasi Gyamfi, President of the Conference, said, “The rescue of Ghana’s cocoa industry is not merely an economic task. It is a moral imperative. Justice for cocoa farmers is justice for Ghana.”</p>

<p>President John Dramani Mahama has extended warm wishes to Ghanaians as the holy month of Ramadan begins.</p>



<p>In a message released on Friday, February 20, he and his wife, Lordina Mahama, wished Muslims across the country a spiritually fulfilling and blessed Ramadan.</p>



<p>In his statement, President Mahama described Ramadan as a “special time; a month of reflection, renewal, and coming together as one community.”</p>

<p>He encouraged Muslims observing the fast to seek purification of the heart and strengthening of their iman, while praying for good health, peace of mind, and abundant mercy throughout the month.</p>



<p>The former president emphasised the importance of compassion, generosity, and discipline during Ramadan.</p>



<p>He noted that while fasting involves abstaining from food and drink, the true essence of the month lies in showing kindness to all, particularly to those less fortunate.</p>



<p>President Mahama also called on Ghanaians to use the holy month to foster unity, love, and peace within their communities.</p>



<p>“Let us strengthen the bonds that bind us and deepen our sense of togetherness across our beloved nation,” he said in the message.</p>



<p>Concluding his Ramadan message, President Mahama said, “From my family, we wish you a spiritually fulfilling and blessed Ramadan. Ramadan Mubarak! May Allah accept your worship.” His message comes as Muslims across Ghana prepare to begin the thirty-day period of fasting, prayer, and reflection.</p>

<p>“We will not fight them with police action, but by expanding our presence and making our services directly accessible to the public, their activities will naturally decline,” he stated.</p>



<p>Mr. Kotey explained that the Bantama office was established through a collaboration between the DVLA and Midcity Auto Service under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement.</p>

<p>“We acknowledge the immense support received from Midcity Auto Service and our private partners. Their contribution made it possible to complete this facility, which we are proud to open to the public today,” he added.</p>



<p>He emphasised that ensuring road safety remains a key priority of the Authority, noting that every driver must be properly trained, tested and certified, while all vehicles must be duly registered and approved before being allowed on the road.</p>



<p>According to him, the new Bantama office will provide a full range of DVLA services, including vehicle registration, transfer of ownership, issuance of new driver’s licences, licence upgrading, renewal of licences, replacement of expired or lost licences, and conversion of foreign licences.</p>

<p>He noted that the facility is equipped with modern technology integrated into the DVLA’s digital systems to ensure faster, efficient and more convenient service delivery.</p>



<p>Mr. Kotey further disclosed that the office will also embark on community outreach programmes to extend DVLA services to residents in surrounding communities, reducing the need for long-distance travel to access essential services.</p>



<p>Chief Operating Officer of Midcity Auto Service, Agya Poku, said the partnership will provide clients with comprehensive services at one location.</p>

<p>“This centre offers an all-inclusive service.

With these facilities in one place, clients can complete all DVLA processes conveniently,” he explained.</p>



<p>The commissioning of the Bantama office is expected to significantly improve access to DVLA services in Kumasi and its environs while promoting efficiency, transparency and road safety compliance.</p>

<p>The Wa District Magistrate Court has convicted three individuals for unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition in the Wa West District of the Upper West Region.</p>



<p>The convicts, identified as Yiritang Boosi, Yahaya Samad, and Adams Alhassan, were prosecuted on Wednesday, February 18, 2026, after being found in possession of firearms and ammunition without lawful authority.</p>



<p>The three had previously been remanded in custody but reappeared before the court, where His Worship Simon Kofi Bediako presided over the proceedings. During the hearing, the accused pleaded guilty to the charges.</p>



<p>Based on their pleas, the court convicted all three and sentenced each to pay a fine of 200 penalty units, equivalent to GH¢2,400. In default of payment, they will serve nine months’ imprisonment.</p>



<p>The prosecution is part of ongoing efforts by the Ghana Police Service to clamp down on illegal weapons possession and enhance public safety in the region.</p>



<p>Police have urged the public to continue supporting law enforcement by providing timely and credible information to help combat crime and maintain peace and security.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ghana Real Estate Developers Association (GREDA) has raised concerns over the persistent high cost of building materials, despite the recent appreciation of the Ghanaian cedi against the US dollar.</p>



<p>GREDA is calling on suppliers of key construction inputs—such as cement, iron rods, and other essential materials—to adjust their prices in line with current exchange rates and actual production costs.</p>



<p>In an interview with Adom News, the Executive Secretary of GREDA, Samuel Amegayibor, criticized the continued pricing of materials based on inflated dollar exchange rates, describing the practice as harmful to the real estate sector and the economy at large.</p>



<p>According to him, while the cedi has recently gained strength, many suppliers have refused to revise their prices downward, citing outdated or exaggerated exchange rate figures.</p>



<p>“This behaviour not only distorts the market but also makes construction projects more expensive and threatens the long-term viability of the industry,” Mr. Amegayibor said.</p>



<p>He called on all suppliers to act responsibly by aligning their pricing with the actual market exchange rates and the true cost of inputs.</p>



<p>Additionally, he urged the government and relevant regulatory bodies to step in and enforce pricing discipline, ensuring transparency throughout the supply chain.</p>



<p>GREDA believes that fair pricing practices are essential to making housing more affordable and sustaining the growth of Ghana’s construction and real estate sectors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Deputy Minister for Trade, Agribusiness and Industry, Sampson Ahi, has reaffirmed the government’s commitment to addressing trade facilitation challenges affecting Ghana’s textile and garment industry, describing the sector as a strategic pillar of the country’s industrialisation and export diversification agenda.</p>



<p>Speaking at the Public-Private Dialogue on Textile and Garment Trade Facilitation Challenges in Sogakope on Wednesday, February 19, Mr Ahi emphasised that the industry holds immense potential for job creation, particularly for women and youth, while strengthening Ghana’s position in regional and global value chains.</p>



<p>The two-day engagement, organised by the Ministry of Trade, Agribusiness and Industry in collaboration with TradeMark Africa (TMA), brought together government agencies, development partners, garment manufacturers, and key stakeholders to identify practical solutions to persistent operational challenges in the sector.</p>

<p>The Bodi lawmaker acknowledged that industry players continue to face constraints across the trade value chain, including customs and clearance procedures, compliance requirements, logistics bottlenecks, and underutilisation of trade facilitation schemes.</p>



<p>“This dialogue has been convened not merely as a forum, but as a partnership,” Ahi said, adding that the Ministry is committed to listening, learning, and collaborating with private sector actors and trade facilitation institutions to implement workable reforms.</p>

<p>He highlighted the importance of the Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) Scheme for faster clearance, reduced inspections, and improved predictability for compliant businesses, and stressed aligning digital trade systems such as ICUMS with operational realities to enhance efficiency.</p>

<p>She noted persistent bottlenecks such as customs system downtimes, port hour misalignments, and documentation delays, which increase costs and reduce production days.</p>



<p>Madam Gayi praised the Ministry’s structured approach and stressed that private sector players are ready to scale to a 24-hour, three-shift production model once a predictable and enabling environment is secured.</p>



<p>Both speakers agreed that streamlining trade systems would boost production, create jobs, and expand economic inclusion, particularly for women and youth.</p>

<p>The statement said the Ghana Police Service, working alongside the Department, is actively investigating to identify and locate the baby’s mother or any close relatives.</p>



<p>The Minister emphasised that the child’s welfare remains the top priority of the ministry.</p>



<p>The Minister commended the community members who discovered and rescued the baby, describing their prompt action as vital to saving her life.</p>



<p>She also appealed to anyone with information that could assist the investigation to come forward and help reunite the child with her family.</p>



<p>Highlighting the serious nature of child abandonment, the Minister urged parents or guardians facing challenges related to unplanned or crisis pregnancies to seek support through the Ministry’s social welfare services.</p>



<p>She reiterated that abandoning a child is a violation of their rights and assured Ghanaians that appropriate care arrangements have been made for the newborn while investigations continue.</p>

<p>This architecture he says is supposed to protect our maritime domain, water bodies, the Gulf of Guinea and some of the lakes and rivers in our region.</p>



<p>“There are a whole lot of developments as far as the protection of our maritime domain is concerned. We&#8217;ve set up the regional maritime architecture. They are supposed to be the centers for monitoring our maritime domain and it is still under (0:20) operationalization. So this meeting is going to discuss how to strengthen that architecture”</p>



<p>He further explained that West Africa’s maritime architecture includes the Sahel and the coastal countries hence given the situation in that part of the region, there delineations will focus on how to enhance collaboration with neighbors in the Sahel in order to link them because their import-export trade goes through coastal West Africa.</p>



<p>Other key items on the agenda include the implementation of the recommendations from the 4th meeting in Cabo Verde, framework for the Combined Maritime Task Force in the Gulf of Guinea, updates on joint maritime operations, status of the staff who have been deployed, and country presentations on maritime security. </p>



<p>In his remarks, the Commissioner highlighted the need to ensure the security of the ECOWAS maritime area and the continued cooperation among the member states to respond to the maritime security issues in the region.</p>



<p>Ahead of the commencement of the summit a four-member delegation from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), led by Director of Peacekeeping and Regional Security, Dr Cyriaque Agnekethom, paid a courtesy call on the Ghana Navy Headquarters aimed at strengthening regional coordination, encourage the exchange of best practices, and improve collective responses to maritime threats in the Gulf of Guinea and across West<br>Africa&#8217;s maritime domain.</p>



<p>During the visit, Dr Agnekethom highlighted the Sub-Committee&#8217;s achievements and ongoing efforts to deepen regional maritime cooperation.</p>



<p>He commended the Ghana Navy for its contributions and thanked it for its continued<br>leadership and active role in joint regional initiatives.</p>



<p>Receiving the delegation on behalf of the Chief of the Naval Staff, Chief Staff Officer at Naval Headquarters, Commodore Ben Baba Abdul, also explained the role maritime security plays in Ghana&#8217;s economy, trade, and the protection of its marine resources.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Member of Parliament for Sefwi Wiaso, Aful Benteh Kofi, has called on cocoa farmers across Ghana to exercise patience as the government works to respond to price fluctuations in the international cocoa market.</p>



<p>His remarks come amid concerns about the government’s ability to sustain the previously announced 70 per cent farmgate price for cocoa.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview, the MP explained that the original price commitment was made when global cocoa prices were significantly higher.</p>



<p>“The pledge was made at a time when international cocoa prices were strong, but subsequent declines have made it difficult to maintain that rate,” he said.</p>



<p>He stressed that the government is actively developing a new legislative proposal that would introduce a dynamic pricing system for cocoa.</p>



<p>“Under the proposed framework, farmgate prices will be more closely aligned with global market trends,” Mr Kofi explained.</p>



<p>“This means farmers will benefit when international prices increase, and the sector will remain stable during downturns.”</p>



<p>As a representative of a cocoa-growing constituency, Mr Kofi expressed empathy for the concerns of farmers.</p>



<p>“I understand the worries of our farmers, and I urge them to remain patient and recognise the realities of the global market. These steps are aimed at ensuring sustainability and improved returns over time,” he said.</p>



<p>He further emphasised that the objective is to protect farmers, not disadvantage them. “The reforms will create a more transparent and responsive pricing mechanism that reflects market conditions while safeguarding Ghana’s cocoa industry,” Mr Kofi added.</p>



<p>He expressed confidence that the proposals, once enacted, would enhance stability and fairness in cocoa pricing nationwide.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minister for Works and Housing, Kenneth Gilbert Adjei, has pledged that the government is actively addressing Ghana’s ongoing water supply challenges.</p>



<p>The assurance came during a meeting convened by the Parliamentary Committee on Sanitation and Water Resources, which brought together key stakeholders, including the Ghana Water Company Limited, the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission, community water representatives, and non-governmental organisations.</p>



<p>Minister Adjei explained that the current water crisis is rooted in longstanding structural issues that were not fully tackled by previous administrations.</p>



<p>“We recognise the challenges, and the government is committed to implementing sustainable solutions to ensure all Ghanaians have reliable access to water,” he stated.</p>



<p>The meeting focused on exploring practical strategies to restore consistent water supply and prevent future shortages.</p>



<p>Emphasis was placed on upgrading infrastructure, enhancing maintenance, and improving coordination among relevant agencies.</p>



<p>Specifically, the Minister addressed concerns in Teshie-Nungua, where residents have experienced intermittent water supply due to a malfunctioning treatment plant.</p>



<p>He confirmed that repair works are underway and expected to be completed within days, restoring normal service to the community.</p>



<p>Adjei concluded by reaffirming the government’s determination to resolve the water crisis across the country.</p>



<p>“These efforts are part of a long-term plan to strengthen Ghana’s water systems and safeguard residents’ access to this vital resource,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Minority Caucus has expressed apprehension following Parliament’s decision to approve the extension of petroleum agreements in the West Cape Three Points (WCTP) and Deepwater Tano (DWT) blocks until 2040.</p>



<p>The caucus, led by Alexander Afenyo-Markin (MP), cautioned that renewing contracts well before their original expiry dates of 2034 and 2036 could set a concerning precedent for early concessions.</p>



<p>Afenyo-Markin argued that such extensions might weaken the government’s future negotiating position with oil companies.</p>



<p>“Approving these contracts several years ahead of schedule could limit our ability to secure more favourable terms down the line and may encourage other operators to expect similar early renewals,” he stated.</p>



<p>The government has justified the move by highlighting a US$2 billion investment plan intended to maintain production levels and support operational stability.</p>



<p>Amendments to the Master Gas Agreement were also approved, with officials claiming they will reduce gas prices and improve supply for domestic industries.</p>



<p>Despite these assurances, the Minority warned that the timing of the approvals raises critical questions about transparency, fiscal responsibility, and long-term national interest.</p>



<p>Lawmakers suggested that early contract renewals could inadvertently prioritise short-term gains over strategic oversight of Ghana’s petroleum resources.</p>



<p>The caucus concluded that while investment and energy stability are important, safeguarding the country’s negotiating leverage and ensuring proper scrutiny of agreements must remain a priority.</p>



<p>They emphasised the need for Parliament to carefully weigh long-term implications before endorsing similar extensions in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Executive Director of the Ghana Real Estate Developers Association (GREDA), Samuel Amegayibor, has endorsed the proposal to cap rent advance payments at one year under the government’s new Rent Bill.</p>



<p>Speaking on the ongoing debate over rent reforms, he described the proposed one-year cap as fair, noting that while landlords often require two years’ advance notice and sometimes more, where possible, such requirements place enormous financial pressure on tenants.</p>



<p>“For me, I think the one-year rent advance is fair. Landlords normally take two years’ advance now and more if they have the opportunity. But they have to appreciate the fact that it doesn’t come easy for people to raise those huge funds just to settle rent,” he stated.</p>



<p>Mr Amegayibor stressed that raising large lump-sum payments to cover multiple years of rent is a significant challenge for many Ghanaians, particularly young people just beginning their careers.</p>



<p>“It’s a mutual consideration between parties. If they understand the need to limit or not demand too much at a time, I think it will go a long way to help, especially the young ones who have just started life,” he said.</p>



<p>He explained that when monthly rents running into several thousands of Ghana cedis are multiplied by 12 or even 24 months, the total figure becomes excessively high for most households.</p>



<p>“When you charge several thousand a month, multiplied by 12 and 24 and all that, I think it is a bit on the high side for people,” he added.</p>



<p>His comments come at a time when the government is pushing for reforms under a new Rent Bill to limit rent advances to a maximum of one year, introduce penalties for violations, and strengthen regulation in the rental housing sector.</p>



<p>The proposed reforms have sparked mixed reactions among stakeholders, but Mr Amegayibor’s endorsement signals growing support within the real estate development community for measures to ease tenants’ financial burden while promoting fairness in the housing market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has moved to clarify that a widely circulated video showing beans allegedly being preserved with a white powder suspected to be cement did not originate from Ghana, following preliminary investigations.</p>



<p>The video, which sparked public concern on social media, depicts individuals walking over heaps of beans, pouring a powdery substance over them, and sweeping it through the grains purportedly to preserve them.</p>



<p>In a statement issued in Accra on February 16, 2026, the FDA stressed that the practices shown in the video are foreign to Ghanaian food handling standards and are not recognised or approved locally.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="803" height="1024" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1-71-803x1024.jpg" alt="FDA clarifies viral ‘cemented beans’ video didn&#039;t originate from Ghana" class="wp-image-10032982795" title="FDA clarifies viral ‘cemented beans’ video didn&#039;t originate from Ghana" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1-71-803x1024.jpg 803w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1-71-235x300.jpg 235w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1-71-768x980.jpg 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1-71-1204x1536.jpg 1204w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1-71-110x140.jpg 110w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1-71-98x125.jpg 98w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1-71-196x250.jpg 196w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1-71-118x150.jpg 118w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1-71-332x424.jpg 332w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1-71-39x50.jpg 39w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1-71.jpg 1209w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px" /></figure>



<p>“Our preliminary review indicates that the language spoken in the video is not Ghanaian, and the procedures depicted fall far below acceptable food safety standards,” the authority said.</p>



<p>The regulator highlighted serious breaches of hygiene and safety in the video, including individuals handling beans with bare hands, applying chemicals without protective equipment, and standing directly on the produce.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="806" height="1024" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-55-806x1024.jpg" alt="FDA clarifies viral ‘cemented beans’ video didn&#039;t originate from Ghana" class="wp-image-10032982796" title="FDA clarifies viral ‘cemented beans’ video didn&#039;t originate from Ghana" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-55-806x1024.jpg 806w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-55-236x300.jpg 236w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-55-768x976.jpg 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-55-110x140.jpg 110w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-55-98x125.jpg 98w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-55-197x250.jpg 197w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-55-118x150.jpg 118w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-55-334x424.jpg 334w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-55-39x50.jpg 39w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-55.jpg 1207w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px" /></figure>



<p>“Such actions compromise food safety and public health. The FDA, together with its stakeholder institutions, does not approve of preservation practices that put consumers at risk,” the statement added.</p>



<p>The FDA reassured the public that the unsafe preservation methods shown are not part of any approved agricultural practice in Ghana.</p>



<p>“Consumers should not associate these practices with our local food systems. Farm produce aggregators and retailers are urged to adhere strictly to approved methods, and the public should report any suspicious food handling activities,” the authority advised.</p>



<p>Reaffirming its commitment, the FDA concluded, “We remain dedicated to safeguarding public health and ensuring that all food products on the Ghanaian market meet established safety and quality standards.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana’s Minister for Energy and Green Transition, Dr. John Abdulai Jinapor, has held a productive courtesy meeting with officials from Cenpower Generation Company Limited, one of the country’s leading independent power producers.</p>



<p>The discussions, which focused on recent developments in the power sector, were described by the Minister as “fruitful and constructive.”</p>



<p>During the engagement, Dr. Jinapor and the Cenpower team explored potential avenues for continued collaboration to support the government’s energy objectives under President John Dramani Mahama’s administration.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-56-1024x683.jpg" alt="Energy Minister John Jinapor holds constructive talks with Cenpower on Ghana’s power sector" class="wp-image-10032982809" title="Energy Minister John Jinapor holds constructive talks with Cenpower on Ghana’s power sector" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-56-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-56-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-56-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-56-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-56-210x140.jpg 210w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-56-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-56-218x145.jpg 218w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-56-636x424.jpg 636w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-56-330x220.jpg 330w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-56-225x150.jpg 225w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-56-217x145.jpg 217w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-56-340x227.jpg 340w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-56-55x37.jpg 55w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-56.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The Minister highlighted the importance of public-private partnerships in achieving a resilient and reliable power supply for Ghana.</p>

<p>“I shared Government’s vision of ensuring an enduring and reliable power supply for the country, while maintaining strict fiscal discipline and safeguarding the sustainability of the sector,” Dr. Jinapor said, according to a statement posted on his Facebook page on Thursday, February 19.</p>



<p>He stressed that maintaining financial sustainability alongside reliable energy provision remains a top priority for the Ministry.</p>

<p>The Minister indicated that such engagements are vital for aligning the operations of independent power producers with national energy goals.</p>



<p>“Cenpower plays a critical role in supplementing our national grid, and dialogue with key industry players allows us to coordinate efforts and innovate solutions for the sector,” he added in the same Facebook post.</p>

<p>Dr. Jinapor concluded by reaffirming his commitment to ongoing consultations with stakeholders across the power industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The African AI Governance Index (AAGI) Foundation has unveiled Africa’s first comprehensive AI governance intelligence platform, providing real-time, open-access insights into policy development and infrastructure capacity across all 54 African Union member states.</p>



<p>The launch marks the establishment of a dedicated institution to answer a critical question: where does Africa stand on AI governance?</p>



<p>“The data existed, but it was scattered across 54 different sources, buried in government websites or locked in consultant reports,” said Kwame A. A. Opoku, Founder and Executive Director of AAGI.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="796" height="1024" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-16-796x1024.jpeg" alt="African AI Governance Index launches first continental AI intelligence platform" class="wp-image-10032982803" title="African AI Governance Index launches first continental AI intelligence platform" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-16-796x1024.jpeg 796w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-16-233x300.jpeg 233w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-16-768x987.jpeg 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-16-109x140.jpeg 109w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-16-97x125.jpeg 97w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-16-194x250.jpeg 194w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-16-117x150.jpeg 117w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-16-330x424.jpeg 330w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-16-39x50.jpeg 39w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/2-16.jpeg 840w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" /></figure>



<p>“We built the infrastructure to centralise, verify, and make it actionable. Africa cannot lead on AI governance if no one can see where Africa stands.”</p>



<p>AAGI’s new Policy Tracker monitors national AI strategies, regulatory frameworks, and institutional developments in real time.</p>



<p>It is the first open-access tool of its kind, allowing governments, investors, and researchers to understand which countries have published strategies, which are in development, and which have yet to begin.</p>



<p>According to Opoku, the platform’s 80-indicator methodology provides double the resolution of existing global indices, enabling actionable insights specific to Africa.</p>



<p>The Foundation will soon launch its **Infrastructure Tracker**, which maps the continent’s compute capacity, data centers, energy sources, submarine cable landing points, and the presence of hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, AWS, and Oracle.</p>



<p>“Africa holds less than 2% of the world’s data centers, yet is preparing to absorb the largest demographic expansion in history,” Opoku noted. “Investors are making billion-dollar infrastructure decisions without sufficient intelligence. We’re fixing that.”</p>



<p>AAGI has also initiated a 10-country pilot assessment, including Botswana, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa, to test its methodology and validate data with on-ground partners.</p>



<p>Stella Agara, Founding Partner, emphasised the importance of local partnerships: “Every Country Partner strengthens the data, validates the methodology, and extends AAGI’s reach. By the time we cover 54 nations, we will have partners invested in the accuracy of what we publish.”</p>



<p>The AAGI Foundation is now seeking Country, Knowledge, Funding, Strategic, and Data Partners to accelerate coverage and impact.</p>



<p>Registered in Ghana, with subsidiaries in Kenya and Delaware, USA, AAGI operates as a non-profit committed to open-access intelligence that empowers Africa to make informed decisions about its AI future.</p>



<p>“AAGI exists to provide data, not speculation,” Opoku concluded. “With accurate intelligence on policy, infrastructure, and human capital, Africa can confidently shape its AI governance landscape and attract sustainable investment.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Executive Secretary of the Ghana Real Estate Developers Association (GREDA), Samuel Amegayibor, has called for the immediate establishment of a National Housing Fund and a National Housing Authority to tackle Ghana’s persistent housing challenges.</p>



<p>His call follows a JoyNews Research analysis of the 2021 Population and Housing Census, which revealed that while the country’s total dwelling units increased from 5.82 million in 2010 to over 10 million, nearly 1.3 million of these units remain unoccupied.</p>



<p>Speaking on Adom FM’s Dwaso Nsem show, Mr. Amegayibor expressed frustration over the country’s failure to implement long-promised solutions to make housing affordable and sustainable.</p>



<p>“The lack of continuity culture in the country is very problematic. We always want to engage in ad-hoc measures and end up recycling our problems,” he lamented.</p>



<p>He noted that although private real estate developers are making efforts, housing costs remain beyond the reach of many Ghanaians due to high interest rates and the absence of structured financial support.</p>



<p>“Individual real estate developers are doing their best, but what they may put out as the minimum price will not be affordable for many people — that’s the reality,” he explained.</p>



<p>Mr. Amegayibor added that developers face steep financial barriers when sourcing funds for housing projects because banks classify them as high-risk borrowers.</p>



<p>“When a developer goes to the market for a loan to build, he is rated as a higher risk compared to someone importing chicken or sugar from abroad, so the interest rate will be high,” he said.</p>



<p>He recalled that as far back as 2015, Ghana’s national housing policy proposed the creation of a special fund to provide developers with affordable loans for housing construction. However, a decade later, the fund has yet to materialise.</p>



<p>“Since 2015, when we included in our national housing policy the creation of a fund for developers to access affordable loans to build houses, we haven’t been able to do so — ten years on,” he emphasised.</p>



<p>Mr. Amegayibor also reiterated the need to establish a National Housing Authority, run by technocrats rather than political appointees, to ensure long-term planning and execution of housing projects.</p>



<p>“The proposal was to establish a National Housing Authority that would be managed by professionals with the technical know-how, not politicians. The technocrats would handle execution and supply of houses, while the government supports with legislation and other enablers,” he explained.</p>



<p>He concluded that only consistent policy implementation, supported by a dedicated housing fund and an independent authority, can help bridge Ghana’s growing housing deficit and make homes more affordable for citizens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Member of Parliament for Assin South, Rev. John Ntim Fordjour, has described the recent terrorist attack that claimed the lives of eight Ghanaian traders in Burkina Faso as evidence of lapses in Ghana’s security preparedness.</p>



<p>Addressing Parliament on February 19, in his capacity as Ranking Member of the Defence and Interior Committee, Rev. Ntim Fordjour said the dangers within Burkina Faso and the wider Sahel region have long been known.</p>



<p>The February 14 attack occurred in a conflict-prone zone where extremist groups have been active.</p>



<p>“The terrorism threats and crises within our neighbouring countries, especially Burkina Faso, are not in doubt or did not start from yesterday,” he told the House.</p>



<p>He insisted that Ghana’s security agencies should have anticipated the risks faced by traders travelling through such territories.</p>



<p>He stressed that a formal travel advisory could have saved lives by alerting citizens to the dangers. “Mr Speaker, these killings are avoidable,” he emphasised, describing the absence of prior caution as a serious oversight.</p>



<p>The Assin South MP called for a comprehensive review of Ghana’s travel advisory system and enhanced collaboration with regional security partners.</p>



<p>He noted that as cross-border trade continues, the government must prioritise proactive risk assessment and public communication to protect Ghanaian nationals abroad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ministry of Education has cautioned that any attack on teachers will be met with “severe consequences” under Ghana’s laws, following a spate of violent incidents reported in schools across the country.</p>



<p>In a press statement dated February 19, the Ministry said it had noted “with grave concern” cases involving students assaulting teachers and other related acts of indiscipline.</p>



<p>“The Ministry takes strong exception to these developments and is resolved to nip this in the bud,” the statement signed by Deputy Minister Dr Clement Apaak said.</p>



<p>It stressed that “any individual, including students, who assaults a teacher in the lawful performance of their professional duties will face severe consequences in accordance with the laws of Ghana.”</p>



<p>Citing a recent case in Kade, the Ministry disclosed that students who assaulted a tutor were arrested and prosecuted.</p>



<p>“The accused persons pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy and assault. They have been convicted and fined,” the statement confirmed, describing the outcome as a clear signal that the law will take its course.</p>



<p>The Ministry also condemned incidents during the Super Zonal Sports Competition in the Eastern Region, which reportedly involved a stabbing and an alleged sexual assault.</p>



<p>According to the statement, “The perpetrators have been arrested and have since been in police custody assisting with investigations,” while victims are receiving medical and psychosocial support.</p>



<p>In another case, two students and an accomplice have been arraigned for allegedly assaulting a teacher and have been remanded into police custody for six weeks pending further proceedings.</p>



<p>At the 54th Delegates Conference of the Ghana National Association of Teachers (GNAT), President John Mahama reaffirmed the government’s zero-tolerance stance on attacks against teachers.</p>



<p>The Ministry noted that the President “reaffirmed that no attack on teachers will be tolerated under any circumstance” and pledged to ensure perpetrators are dealt with in accordance with the law.</p>



<p>The Ministry added that it remains committed to working with law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to demand justice for victims and safeguard the safety of teachers nationwide.</p>

<p>A fire has gutted one of the heritage trains owned by Ghanaian creative artist and author Ibrahim Mahama at his Red Clay Studio in Tamale, Northern Region.</p>



<p>The incident occurred on Wednesday, February 18, 2026, during ongoing repair work on the train.</p>



<p>In a Facebook post on Thursday, February 19, Mr. Mahama described the loss as a “tragic misfortune,” explaining that sparks from repair activities ignited the blaze.</p>

<p>“Certainly, I am sure if a lot more care had been taken, this could have been prevented,” he noted.</p>



<p>The affected train was part of a collection of decommissioned colonial-era and post-independence railway stock acquired by Mahama nearly two years ago from the Ghana Railway Company.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Government of Ghana has proposed renaming the National Intelligence Bureau (NIB) as the Bureau of National Intelligence (BNI) under the Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025, to reduce public confusion with the National Investment Bank.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Government has proposed renaming the National Intelligence Bureau (NIB) as the Bureau of National Intelligence (BNI) under the Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025, to reduce public confusion with the National Investment Bank.</p>



<p>The announcement was made by the Minister of the Interior, Mohammed Mubarak Muntaka, during parliamentary deliberations on Thursday, February 19, 2026.</p>



<p>Addressing Members of Parliament, the Minister explained that the overlap of acronyms has created unnecessary ambiguity within the country’s security framework.</p>



<p>“Everywhere in the world, you make sure that the acronyms for the security agencies do not match any other thing, and in fact, it is supported by law to make sure that nobody is able to name anything after an acronym of any of the security agencies,” he said.</p>



<p>He emphasised that the change seeks to align Ghana’s practices with international norms.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, we have a situation where, when you say NIB, people are wondering whether you’re talking about the bank or you’re talking about the security agency. </p>



<p>&#8220;So Mister Speaker, one of the significant things that we are trying to do is to reintroduce the name BNI at this time, even though the BNI of yesterday was Bureau of National Investigation, this BNI will still remain Bureau of National Intelligence,” Minister Muntaka explained.</p>



<p>The Bill also proposes eliminating the Ministry of National Security portfolio to streamline operations and reduce role duplication.</p>



<p>Instead, the President will designate a Minister to oversee the National Security Coordinator.</p>



<p>“A detailed ministerial role and the function of the national security coordinator… if you assign or leave a ministry called Ministry of National Security… they begin to conflate, and they begin to have misunderstandings, and that affects the security architecture that we have in the country,” the Minister noted.</p>



<p>He further clarified the intended oversight framework: “One of the things that we are trying to do is to keep this position as more or less of that of the President, and then he gets one of his ministers to play that oversight without the necessarily fine, detailed designation of a minister for national security, so that as much as possible you try to avoid the conflict between the minister and the National Security Coordinator.”</p>



<p>The proposed reforms are part of a broader initiative to strengthen Ghana’s security institutions while ensuring clarity, efficiency, and alignment with global best practices.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[President of the Association of Ghana Industries, Dr Kofi Nsiah-Poku, has warned that persistent water shortages, high interest rates and rising unemployment are threatening Ghana’s industrial growth.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President of the Association of Ghana Industries, Dr Kofi Nsiah-Poku, has warned that persistent water shortages, high interest rates and rising unemployment are threatening Ghana’s industrial growth.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News&#8217; PM Express Business Edition on Thursday, he painted a stark picture of the operational challenges facing manufacturers, especially beverage producers that depend heavily on water.</p>



<p>“It is so bad in the sense that for about two weeks, water wasn’t running, and when it started, they were rationing it twice a week, and it runs for about only six hours,” he said.</p>



<p>Dr Nsiah-Poku revealed that even his own fruit juice factory has been affected.</p>



<p>“I also have an industry there producing fruit juice, and they work only twice, and we have to buy water from outside to put in the water tanks before you can do production,” he disclosed.</p>



<p>According to him, such conditions make serious industrialisation impossible.</p>



<p>“So as a nation, we cannot industrialise with this kind of situation,” he stressed.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8o9iYFErvE?si=ifA-B0no6vcr7XoI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>Beyond water shortages, he pointed to the impact of previously high interest rates on business expansion.</p>



<p>“Even before, the interest rate was so high that you know, it was not worth borrowing money to do business,” he said.</p>



<p>He explained that the high rates distorted economic incentives.</p>



<p>“It was rather more interesting to really change your money, your asset, into cash, and just go and buy treasury bills,” he noted.</p>



<p>Dr Nsiah-Poku said the combined effect of weak industrial growth and financial pressures has had consequences for employment.</p>



<p>“So unemployment has become very high because the industry is not growing, it’s rather falling,” he said.</p>



<p>Despite the grim assessment, he signalled the need for a turnaround.</p>



<p>“But we’ve come to a point where we have to reverse it, and that is what I’ve come to do,” he added.</p>



<p>His remarks highlight mounting pressure on the productive sector, as manufacturers grapple with unreliable utilities and financial constraints.</p>



<p>For an economy seeking to expand local production and create jobs, the AGI President’s warning underscores the urgency of stabilising critical infrastructure and reducing the cost of doing business.</p>



<p>Without reliable water and affordable financing, he suggests, industry cannot thrive — and jobs will remain at risk.</p>
