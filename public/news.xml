<p>Founder and CEO of Jacob West Limited, Michael Kyei-Ayensu, has candidly detailed the unexpected hurdles he faced after relocating from the United Kingdom to establish his business in Ghana, revealing that adapting to the local business environment proved far more complex than anticipated.</p>



<p>Speaking on <em><strong>Personality Profile with Lexis Bill on Joy FM</strong></em>, the diaspora entrepreneur said his early years in Ghana were marked by difficult adjustments, despite his prior success in the UK property and finance space.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0YUqqhpocRU?si=AJ3ZfL9dOksYhHcr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p><strong>High expectations meet harsh reality</strong></p>



<p>Reflecting on the transition period, Mr Kyei-Ayensu, who was a guest on the show on Thursday, February 19, admitted he initially underestimated the depth of structural and cultural differences between the two business environments.</p>



<p>“At the beginning stages…I didn&#8217;t expect this,” he said during the interview.</p>



<p>Pressed on what exactly surprised him, the Jacob West boss explained that Ghana’s business ecosystem operates very differently from the systems-driven model he was used to in Britain.</p>



<p>&#8220;It runs on emotions and culture, rather than systems and processes. And I didn&#8217;t understand that at the beginning stages.”</p>



<p><strong>UK playbook didn’t translate easily</strong></p>



<p>Before relocating, Mr Kyei-Ayensu and his brother had built a business in the UK, where structured financing, predictable regulations, and data-driven decision-making shaped operations. That experience led him to believe the same formula could be replicated locally.</p>



<p>“And I felt as though, as long as I implement what I&#8217;ve learned in the UK, in Ghana, I&#8217;ll be fine. Right?” he recounted.</p>



<p>However, he quickly discovered that success in Ghana required a different strategic approach, one that blended formal systems with relationship management and deep cultural understanding.</p>



<p><strong>Starting from scratch again</strong></p>



<p>Mr Kyei-Ayensu noted that one of the biggest shocks was entering a market where he lacked the institutional knowledge and networks that had supported his earlier ventures abroad.</p>



<p>“In the UK, we set up business with zero. There was no investment. It was ideas. And it became a business,” he explained.</p>



<p>Confident from that experience, he initially believed the Ghana move would follow a similar trajectory.</p>



<p>“So I said, &#8216;I can do this&#8217;. But then we understood the system [in the UK], and we knew where, if we started, we could navigate ourselves to get to where we needed to get to.”</p>



<p>That confidence, he admitted, met its toughest test upon arrival in Ghana.</p>



<p>“But in Ghana, we didn&#8217;t know the system. We didn&#8217;t understand the process.”</p>



<p><strong>Building Jacob West against the odds</strong></p>



<p>Despite the early turbulence, Mr Kyei-Ayensu has since grown Jacob West into a recognised Ghanaian real estate and property advisory firm, known for mortgage brokerage, property investment guidance and diaspora-focused housing solutions.</p>



<p>Industry observers credit the company with helping bridge financing gaps for many first-time homeowners and diaspora investors seeking property opportunities in Ghana.</p>



<p>Business analysts say his journey mirrors a common diaspora challenge, where the assumption is that technical expertise alone guarantees success back home.</p>



<p><strong>Lessons for returning diaspora entrepreneurs</strong></p>



<p>Mr Kyei-Ayensu stressed that, beyond capital and technical knowledge, returning entrepreneurs must invest time in understanding local business culture and regulatory pathways.</p>



<p>His experience underscores a broader policy conversation about improving ease of doing business and formalising systems within Ghana’s private sector environment.</p>



<p>Today, he says the early setbacks have become valuable learning tools that shaped Jacob West’s growth strategy and resilience.</p>



<p>For many diaspora professionals eyeing a return home, his story serves both as inspiration and caution: global experience is valuable, but local intelligence is indispensable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Jacob West Ltd, Michael Kyei-Ayensu, has revealed that the devastating 2008 global financial crisis forced him to abandon a UK business and return to Ghana to rebuild from scratch.</p>



<p>Speaking on <strong>Personality Profile</strong> with <strong>Lexis Bill</strong> on <strong>Joy FM</strong>, the Ghanaian entrepreneur recounted how the credit crunch wiped out much of the progress he and his brother had made in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p><strong>UK success derailed by global recession</strong></p>



<p>Mr Kyei-Ayensu, who was a guest on the show on Thursday, February 19, said his UK-based property and financial services business was performing strongly until the global downturn struck.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0YUqqhpocRU?si=AJ3ZfL9dOksYhHcr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“Although we were doing very well in the UK… the latter part of 2007, 2008, there was this beast of a credit crunch, like the whole world,” he explained.</p>



<p>According to him, the downturn was swift and brutal, collapsing deal flow almost overnight.</p>



<p>“It was crazy. Like what we were achieving became less than 1% of what we were achieving,” he said.</p>



<p>He noted that while more experienced entrepreneurs had seen similar cycles before, he and his brother were unprepared for the scale of the disruption.</p>



<p>“But for us, we had no clue. We didn&#8217;t have any idea how we&#8217;re going to navigate this issue.”</p>



<p><strong>Heavy losses and business collapse</strong></p>



<p>The impact was severe. Mr Kyei-Ayensu disclosed that the crisis forced them to surrender multiple properties and lose significant equity.</p>



<p>“We lost quite a few properties,” he told the programme.</p>



<p>Pressed on the extent of the damage, he added, &#8220;Down in terms of losing properties, three to four properties with all equity.”</p>



<p>The operational slowdown was equally dramatic. Weekly business volumes plunged from about 20 transactions to just one.</p>



<p>“Let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re doing 20 cases a week. It became one case a week. That&#8217;s how bad it was,” he revealed.</p>



<p>He attributed the collapse largely to tightening credit conditions in the UK banking sector.</p>



<p>“Literally, banks were pulling financial products from the market, which doesn&#8217;t allow us to brokerage.”</p>



<p><strong>Decision to return to Ghana</strong></p>



<p>Faced with shrinking opportunities and mounting losses, Mr Kyei-Ayensu said he and his brother made a decisive strategic pivot.</p>



<p>“It was literally from hero to zero. And it was tough. And then from that point on, our minds were like, let&#8217;s get out of here.”</p>



<p>Their conclusion was clear and immediate: “Let&#8217;s get out of here. Let&#8217;s try Ghana. Let&#8217;s try Ghana.”</p>



<p>The move marked the beginning of what would later become one of Ghana’s emerging indigenous real estate and property advisory brands.</p>



<p><strong>Building Jacob West in Ghana</strong></p>



<p>Since relocating, Mr Kyei-Ayensu has focused on building Jacob West Ltd into a player in Ghana’s real estate brokerage and property services space.</p>



<p>Industry observers note that his return coincided with Ghana’s post-2008 property expansion, driven by urbanisation, diaspora investment and rising demand for formal housing in Accra and other major cities.</p>



<p>Under his leadership, the company has positioned itself around:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Property brokerage</li>



<li>Real estate advisory</li>



<li>Investment support services</li>



<li>Market intelligence for property buyers</li>
</ul>



<p>Mr Kyei-Ayensu is widely regarded within Ghana’s property circles as part of a new generation of returnee entrepreneurs who brought diaspora experience back home following the global financial crisis.</p>



<p>Reflecting on the experience, the Jacob West CEO suggested the UK setback ultimately reshaped his entrepreneurial outlook and risk appetite.</p>



<p>The crisis, he implied, forced a strategic rethink about geography, resilience and long-term opportunity, lessons that continue to inform his business philosophy in Ghana’s evolving real estate market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A total of 1,000 Kenyans have been recruited to fight for Russia, according to a Kenyan intelligence report that details a network of rogue officials allegedly colluding with human trafficking syndicates.</p>



<p>The report, submitted to parliament on Wednesday by Kenya&#8217;s National Intelligence Service (NIS), said 89 Kenyans were on the front lines of the Russia–Ukraine war as of February this year.</p>



<p>At least one Kenyan has died, while several others have returned home injured or traumatised, it added.</p>



<p>The Kenyan government, which previously estimated that about 200 of its nationals had been recruited to fight for Russia,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0k1jzvrykro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wants Moscow to bar the conscription of Kenyan soldiers.</a></p>



<p>Presenting the report to MPs, parliament majority leader Kimani Ichung&#8217;wah, revealed what he termed a &#8220;deeply disturbing&#8221; network of rogue state officials allegedly colluding with human trafficking syndicates to recruit and transport Kenyans to fight in the Russia–Ukraine war.</p>



<p>The spy agency detailed how recruitment agencies have allegedly been colluding with rogue Kenyan airport staff, immigration officers, officers at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), anti-narcotics officers and National Employment Authority officers to facilitate recruits&#8217; travel.</p>



<p>Ichung&#8217;wah alleged that the agencies had also been colluding with staff at the Russian embassy in Nairobi and the Kenyan embassy in Moscow to help recruits get Russian visas.</p>



<p>In a statement on Thursday, the Russian embassy in Nairobi dismissed the allegations as &#8220;dangerous and misleading&#8221;, saying that its staff has never been involved in &#8220;rogue schemes&#8221; or engaged in illegal enlistment.</p>



<p>&#8220;At no point in time throughout the ongoing crisis in Ukraine [has] the Embassy ever issued visas to Kenyan citizens who sought to travel to Russia with the stated pose of participating in the Special Military Operation (SMO) in Ukraine.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nor the Embassy been encouraging any Kenyan citizen to do so.&#8221;</p>



<p>The embassy added that while it does not recruit foreigners, Russian law allows foreign nationals who are legally in Russia to voluntarily enlist in their armed forces.</p>



<p>While in parliament, Ichung&#8217;wah said that Kenya&#8217;s ambassador to Moscow &#8220;must be able to identify the officers within the embassy that may have colluded with these criminals. Our embassy must be beyond reproach. It must be the place where Kenyans can seek refuge, not exploitation.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Government offices are not to be used for criminal activities,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>The BBC has asked the Kenyan foreign ministry for comment.</p>



<p>The report did not say what had happened to the majority of the recruits but said that in addition to those on the front line, another 35 had been sent to military camps in Russia, 39 are injured and 28 are missing.</p>



<p>According to the investigation, ex-military personnel, ex-police officers and unemployed Kenyans aged 20–50 are the main targets of the recruiters.</p>



<p>Recruits are promised a monthly pay of up to 350,000 Kenyan shillings ($2,400; £2,000), with bonuses ranging from KSh 900,000 to KSh 1.2 million ($6,200–$8,300;£5,200–£7,000).</p>



<p>However, upon arrival, many reportedly find themselves deployed to front-line combat roles after minimal military training.</p>



<p>&#8220;They are told you are going to work as a guard… only to get there and you are taken to military camps,&#8221; Ichung&#8217;wah said.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve only trained for three weeks. They are basically just giving you a gun to go and die,&#8221; he added.</p>



<p>Those undergoing explosives and weapons training are only required to attend training for nine days before being sent to the front line, the report said.</p>



<p>Ichung&#8217;wah said that, initially, recruits departed through Nairobi&#8217;s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) using tourist visas and travelled through Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>



<p>However, with heightened surveillance at JKIA, traffickers reportedly changed tactics, rerouting victims through South Africa, Uganda and other neighbouring states.</p>



<p>The report identified some of the rogue agencies behind the recruitment of Kenyans and the medical facilities used for testing.</p>



<p>Authorities say several suspects, including the alleged mastermind, remain under active investigation, with further arrests expected. Investigations continue as officials seek additional suspects and work to rescue Kenyans still caught in the conflict.</p>



<p>Speaking to the BBC last week, Kenya&#8217;s Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi said Nairobi had shut down more than 600 recruitment agencies suspected of duping Kenyans with promises of jobs overseas.</p>



<p>Mudavadi said Kenya was working closely with Russia to curb illegal recruitment practices, including discussions on visa policy and bilateral labour agreements that exclude military conscription.</p>



<p>The foreign minister is due to visit Moscow next month to discuss the matter.</p>



<p>So far, 27 Kenyans who had been fighting in Russia have been repatriated, he said, with authorities providing psychological care to address their trauma and &#8220;de-radicalise&#8221; them.</p>



<p>Pressure has been mounting on the Kenyan government to act after the recent discovery of more bodies of nationals of African countries who had been recruited to fight for the Russian armed forces.</p>



<p>Last November, Ukraine&#8217;s foreign minister said that more than 1,400 people from 36 countries in Africa had been recruited to fight for Russia.</p>



<p>Ukraine has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.</p>



<p>Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gr54n8260o" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Police in South Africa have arrested the youngest son of Zimbabwe&#8217;s late former President Robert Mugabe, who is facing a charge of attempted murder after a reported shooting at a property in an upmarket suburb of Johannesburg.</p>



<p>Bellarmine Mugabe, 28, was taken into custody after a 23-year-old man, believed to be a gardener, was shot and injured.</p>



<p>Officers searching the house in Hyde Park, where Mugabe was staying, have found bullet cartridges but no firearm, police have said.</p>



<p>Bellarmine Mugabe is the youngest son of Robert and his second wife Grace Mugabe. Robert Mugabe, who died in 2019, led Zimbabwe for 37 years before being forced out of power at the age of 93 in 2017.</p>



<p>One other man has been arrested alongside Bellarmine Mugabe as investigators continue their work, police spokesperson Col Dimakatso Nevhuhulwi said.</p>



<p>The pair are expected to appear in court &#8220;soon&#8221;, according to a police statement.</p>



<p>Police are not yet officially naming Bellarmine Mugabe as one of those arrested, but reporters at the scene saw him in handcuffs, and he has been widely named by local media.</p>



<p>The victim is in hospital and in a critical condition after being shot once, the spokesperson added.</p>



<p>In a briefing outside the property, Nevhuhulwi said the two suspects have not &#8220;told us where the gun is, they are not saying anything about the gun&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minority Caucus in Parliament has rejected the proposed Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025, describing it as deeply flawed and overly centralising power in the Presidency.</p>



<p>In a statement dated February 18 and signed by Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin, the caucus said while it supports reforms to modernise Ghana’s national security architecture, it cannot support the bill in its current form.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ej4E6KqEbKg?si=O93bkzJ_FBZB_qtm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“Let me be clear. The Minority Caucus supports the need to reform Ghana’s national security architecture,” the statement said. “However, in its current form, this Bill is deeply flawed.”</p>



<p>The Minority argued that the legislation concentrates excessive appointing powers in the President, weakens independent oversight, and expands intrusive surveillance authority without adequate human rights safeguards.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ss_ZNTT1Hk?si=8fafFxhBXxe6zIc_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>On presidential powers, the caucus warned that the bill allows key security appointments without parliamentary vetting.</p>



<p>“It is unacceptable that they operate without legislative scrutiny,” the statement noted, adding that the offices involved control agencies with coercive powers and access to sensitive national data.</p>



<p>The Minority also criticised the proposed oversight structure, arguing that placing the National Security Council, chaired by the President, as the governing body of intelligence agencies amounts to self-regulation.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/majority-minority-clash-over-bill-to-revert-nib-name-to-bni-and-overhaul-national-security-structure/">Read also: Majority, Minority clash over bill to revert NIB name to BNI and overhaul national security structure</a></li>
</ul>



<p>“That amounts to self-oversight,” it stated.</p>



<p>On parliamentary scrutiny, the caucus raised concerns about provisions allowing security officers to withhold documents if disclosure is deemed prejudicial to national security.</p>



<p>“There is no requirement to provide reasons or even redacted versions,” the statement pointed out.</p>



<p>The Minority further objected to criminal sanctions of five to ten years for certain disclosures, arguing that the bill provides no explicit protection for whistleblowers.</p>



<p>On surveillance powers, it described the warrant regime as “deeply troubling,” warning that administrative authorisation for intercepting communications undermines the principle that only courts should approve invasions of privacy.</p>



<p>The caucus also expressed concern about the structure of Regional and District Security Councils, cautioning that their composition could risk politicisation, particularly during election periods.</p>



<p>“For these reasons, we cannot support the Bill in its present form,” the statement concluded.</p>



<p>The Minority called for independent oversight mechanisms, judicial-only warrant authorisation, stronger whistleblower protections, clearer human rights safeguards, and improved financial transparency.</p>



<p>“National security and civil liberty are not opposing goals. We can protect our nation without eroding the freedoms of our people. Parliament must get this balance right,” the statement said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At least 34 people have been killed in coordinated attacks by suspected Islamist militants on several villages in north-western Nigeria, officials have told the BBC.</p>



<p>The gunmen launched simultaneous assaults on multiple communities in a remote border district of Kebbi state on Tuesday, overwhelming local defences and forcing residents to flee their homes.</p>



<p>Survivors described the attackers as highly organised, saying they swept through villages firing indiscriminately at residents.</p>



<p>Officials have blamed the relatively new insurgent group Lakurawa, which is known to operate in the area. It was targeted by US air strikes in December, further north, in Sokoto state.</p>



<p>Security forces have now moved into the area to protect communities and assist survivors. Tracking operations are underway to cut off the militants&#8217; escape routes.</p>



<p>Authorities are yet to officially comment on the attacks, although images of shrouded corpses being prepared for burial have been circulating on social media.</p>



<p>The attack has sparked outrage among Nigerians online, with many calling on the government to end the violence that has become all too common in parts of the country.</p>



<p>Nigerian authorities officially declared Lakurawa a terrorist organisation last year and banned it across the country after reports emerged that its fighters were flogging people for listening to music.</p>



<p>Officials say Lakurawa is affiliated with jihadist factions in Mali and Niger. Its militants have for years settled in communities along the Nigeria-Niger border, marrying local women and recruiting young people into their ranks.</p>



<p>The group has previously carried out similar raids in Kebbi, using coordinated simultaneous attacks to swamp local defences.</p>



<p>The emergence of Lakurawa adds to Nigeria&#8217;s already complex security challenges, as the government continues to battle multiple armed groups, from Boko Haram Islamists in the north-east to heavily armed kidnapping gangs operating across the north-west and central states and separatists in the south-east.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) has commissioned a premium service centre at Bantama in Kumasi, a move aimed at bringing its services closer to residents and reducing the activities of middlemen, popularly known as “goro boys.”</p>



<p>The Chief Executive of the Authority, Julius Neequaye Kotey, speaking at the commissioning ceremony, said the establishment of the new facility forms part of efforts to improve service delivery and enhance transparency in line with the government’s ‘Reset Agenda’.</p>

<p>“These new DVLA offices signify our commitment to bringing services closer to the people and minimising the activities of goro boys within our system. </p>



<p>&#8220;We will not fight them with police action, but by expanding our presence and making our services directly accessible to the public, their activities will naturally decline,” he stated.</p>



<p>Mr. Kotey explained that the Bantama office was established through a collaboration between the DVLA and Midcity Auto Service under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement.</p>

<p>“We acknowledge the immense support received from Midcity Auto Service and our private partners. Their contribution made it possible to complete this facility, which we are proud to open to the public today,” he added.</p>



<p>He emphasised that ensuring road safety remains a key priority of the Authority, noting that every driver must be properly trained, tested and certified, while all vehicles must be duly registered and approved before being allowed on the road.</p>



<p>According to him, the new Bantama office will provide a full range of DVLA services, including vehicle registration, transfer of ownership, issuance of new driver’s licences, licence upgrading, renewal of licences, replacement of expired or lost licences, and conversion of foreign licences.</p>

<p>He noted that the facility is equipped with modern technology integrated into the DVLA’s digital systems to ensure faster, efficient and more convenient service delivery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Bank of Ghana (BoG) is warning that pressures from dividend payments scheduled for February 2026 and March 2026 may pose downside risks to the Ghana cedi.</p>



<p>According to its January 2026 Monetary Policy Report, a fall in gold prices due to the strengthening of the global economy or a de-escalation of geopolitical tensions could also pose downside risks for the Ghana cedi.</p>



<p>In the domestic forex market, the local currency came under some marginal pressure in early 2026 after an impressive performance in 2025.</p>



<p>Demand pressures, largely from energy, commerce, and manufacturing, were partly offset by BoG foreign exchange intermediation, mining and remittance flows, and export proceeds from other corporates.</p>



<p>The Central Bank said in the near term, the cedi is expected to remain stable, supported by continued BoG forex intermediation and strong reserve buildup.</p>



<p>It pointed out that proposed government infrastructure bonds to be issued in 2026 could further support the cedi.</p>



<p>“Furthermore, the final tranche of the IMF loan, flows from other external partners, and continued fiscal discipline will support the currency. Additionally, the dollar&#8217;s weakness, stemming from the Fed’s dovish outlook, as well as concerns about the Fed’s independence, will support the cedi”, it concluded.</p>



<p>In 2005, the cedi appreciated by 40.67%, 30.89% and 23.97% against the dollar, pound, and euro, respectively, on a year-to-date basis in the interbank market.</p>



<p>This is against a depreciation of 19.18%, 17.76% and 13.72% against the dollar, pound, and euro, respectively during the same period in 2024.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minister for Government Communications,&nbsp;Felix Kwakye Ofosu, has rejected claims that the absence of a substantive Defence Minister has created a vacuum within Ghana’s security architecture.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on<strong> Joy FM&#8217;s Top Story</strong> on Thursday, February 19, he explained that ministers do not implement personal policies but rather execute policies approved by the government and led by President John Dramani Mahama.</p>



<p>He further clarified that there is currently a minister responsible for defence who is capable of carrying out all required duties of the office.</p>



<p>“That another minister is acting as <a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/burkina-faso-attack-nitiwul-urges-government-to-appoint-defence-minister/">Defence Minister</a> does not in any way prevent him from implementing those policies. There is no lacuna,” the official stressed.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02eKkuBulmE?si=dFaRqbp5BoAvtE2x" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>According to Mr Kwakye Ofosu, President Mahama has already indicated that he will appoint a substantive Defence Minister at an appropriate time. </p>



<p>“The President has not indicated any difficulty whatsoever. He believes it ought to be done at the right time, and when that decision is made, it will be communicated,” he stated.</p>



<p>Addressing concerns over recent security developments, including the terrorist attack in Burkina Faso, the government insisted that all necessary steps have been taken to respond appropriately.</p>



<p>The government maintains that national security operations remain intact and coordinated, dismissing suggestions that the absence of a substantive minister has weakened Ghana’s defence posture.</p>

<p>The Minister for Government Communications, Felix Kwakye Ofosu, has assured Ghanaians that President John Dramani Mahama will appoint a substantive Defence Minister at the “appropriate time&#8221;.</p>



<p> Speaking in an interview on <strong>Joy FM&#8217;s Top Story</strong>, he dismissed concerns that the delay in appointing a substantive minister has created a vacuum within the country’s security architecture.</p>



<p>Responding to criticism from sections of the opposition and security analysts, he noted that there is currently no governance gap at the Ministry of Defence. </p>

<p>The government also rejected suggestions that the President is facing difficulty in identifying a successor, insisting that no such indication has been given.</p>



<p>“The President has not indicated any difficulty whatsoever in naming a substantive minister. He believes it ought to be done at the right time and within a given timeframe. When that decision is made, it will be communicated,” he explained.</p>



<p>He added that the acting minister is fully empowered to execute all duties of the office in line with policies approved by Cabinet and led by the President.</p>

<p>“We’re in the month of love and being asked to show kindness, and as you know, kindness is like a garden of flowers where love endures forever. So in this month of love, I’m here to show my love, and I call on every Ghanaian to come here to show their love. You may not have to be here physically, but you can use the digital channels or mobile money across all networks to show your love,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>“I would also like to call on my big brother, Simon Madjie, the CEO of the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre, to come to Mahama Cares and show love.”</p>



<p>The fund was established in 2025 as part of the government’s health policy interventions aimed at improving healthcare access and providing support to vulnerable groups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ministry of Education has issued a strong warning that assault on teachers will attract severe legal consequences, following a series of violent incidents recorded in schools across the country.</p>



<p>In a press statement signed by Deputy Minister for Education, Dr. Clement Abas Apaak, the Ministry expressed grave concern over cases involving attacks on teachers by students and other related acts of violence.</p>



<p>“The Ministry takes strong exception to these developments and is resolved to nip this in the bud,” the statement said. </p>



<p>It stressed that any individual — including students — who assaults a teacher in the lawful performance of their duties will face punishment in accordance with the laws of Ghana.</p>



<p>The Ministry highlighted several recent incidents that have resulted in arrests and prosecutions.</p>



<p>At Kade Senior High Technical School (Kade SHTS), perpetrators involved in the assault of a tutor were arrested and arraigned before the Kade District Court. The accused persons pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy and assault and have since been convicted and fined.</p>



<p>In another case at West Africa Senior High School, two students and an accomplice have been arraigned before an Adenta Circuit Court in connection with the assault of a teacher. The accused persons have been remanded into police custody for six weeks pending further court proceedings.</p>



<p>The Ministry also condemned misconduct recorded during the Super Zonal Sports Competition in the Eastern Region, which reportedly involved a stabbing and an alleged sexual assault. The suspects in that case have been arrested and are assisting police with investigations, while the victims are receiving medical and psychosocial support.</p>

<p>The statement referenced remarks by President John Dramani Mahama at the 54th Delegates Conference of the Ghana National Association of Teachers (GNAT), where he reiterated that no attack on teachers would be tolerated under any circumstances. </p>



<p>The President reaffirmed the government’s commitment to protecting educators and ensuring justice for victims.</p>



<p>The Ministry aligned itself with the President’s position and pledged to continue working closely with law enforcement agencies and the judiciary to ensure accountability and prevent future incidents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Former Deputy Defence Minister Kofi Amankwa-Manu has warned that Ghana risks compromising critical security decision-making due to the continued absence of a substantive Defence Minister.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on <strong>Joy FM&#8217;s Top Story</strong> on Thursday, Mr. Amankwa-Manu argued that certain high-level decisions within the security architecture can only be taken by a fully appointed minister and not the Chief of Defence Staff or the Deputy Minister.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you have a substantive minister, it becomes easier for him to deal with the Ministry of Defence from the other front. There are certain cooperation agreements with other nations pertaining to security, also with the army, that you need a substantive minister to really deal with. And so not to have a substantive minister, for me, it&#8217;s a problem because that ministry is very sensitive and very strategic,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>According to him, without a substantive minister, key matters affecting the military may not receive the necessary advocacy and coordination at the Council.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02eKkuBulmE?si=qYlsLiSYXPYn3hvt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“The Defence Minister sits as a member of the Security Council. There are issues about the Ghana Armed Forces that a substantive minister will have to carry to the Council. If you don’t have that, it becomes a problem,” he said.</p>



<p>Referencing recent security concerns, including attacks on Ghanaians in Burkina Faso, the former Deputy Minister noted that international defence cooperation requires ministerial-level engagement.</p>



<p>Mr. Amankwa-Manu maintained that prolonged delays in appointing a substantive minister could weaken coordination, diplomacy, and rapid response mechanisms.</p>



<p>While acknowledging the efforts of existing officials within the ministry, he insisted that full ministerial authority is indispensable in matters of national security.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana) has highlighted a notable improvement in living conditions for many Ghanaians during the first year of the President John Dramani Mahama administration, attributing the trend to macroeconomic stability, currency appreciation, and falling fuel prices.</p>



<p>In its one-year assessment of the Mahama government, CDD noted that while lower inflation technically indicates that prices are rising more slowly, Ghanaians have experienced real price reductions across key sectors, signalling a tangible relief in the cost of living.</p>



<p>Fuel prices at the pump fell by approximately 4% to 8% between December 2025 and January 2026. This drop translated into a 15% reduction in commercial transport fares, directly easing daily commuting costs and the transportation of goods, the CDD report explained.</p>



<p>Food inflation saw a dramatic decline, falling from 28.3% in January 2025 to 4.9% by December 2025, while the cost of imported essentials, including medicines and raw materials, stabilised thanks to the appreciation of the Cedi.</p>



<p>CDD emphasised that while these developments have improved disposable incomes, particularly in major cities such as Accra and Kumasi, regional disparities remain. </p>



<p>Northern areas, for instance, have experienced slower price reductions due to logistical bottlenecks, including poor transport and communication infrastructure.</p>



<p>The assessment highlighted the administration’s ambitious fiscal consolidation efforts. By cutting wasteful spending and terminating underperforming programmes, the government reduced the national deficit from 7.9% to 3.1%, even achieving a temporary surplus by mid-2025.</p>



<p>CDD noted that this fiscal discipline allowed the government to provide direct relief to citizens and entrepreneurs through the abolition of “nuisance” taxes such as the E-Levy, Betting Tax, and Emission Tax, while raising the VAT threshold to protect small businesses.</p>



<p>“The state has managed to stabilise the economy without imposing additional tax burdens on the average Ghanaian,” the report stated.</p>



<p>Despite these achievements, CDD warned that revenue mobilisation remains a significant challenge. Tax revenue currently stands at 16.1% of GDP, below levels recorded in neighbouring countries such as Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire.</p>



<p>The report cautioned that insufficient revenue forces the government to borrow more, potentially raising public debt. </p>



<p>This concern is compounded by the launch of large-scale social and infrastructure projects, including the GH₵13.85 billion “Big Push” infrastructure plan and the “MahamaCares” health trust.</p>



<p>CDD emphasised that while these initiatives promise long-term benefits, they could strain the budget if additional revenue streams are not secured.</p>



<p>The think tank highlighted AI-driven tax compliance measures as a promising solution, which could enhance revenue collection and compensate for the loss of funds from abolished “nuisance” taxes such as the E-Levy.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Forum for Accountability and Development of Sefwi, Simon Asafo Adjei, has accused both the government and the opposition of shifting blame over the recent reduction in cocoa prices, insisting that the issue is a social and economic concern rather than a political one.</p>



<p>Speaking on&nbsp;<strong>Asempa FM’s&nbsp;<em>Ekosii Sen</em>&nbsp;show</strong>, Mr. Asafo Adjei said cocoa farmers in the Western North Region are demanding a reversal of the new pricing, which saw the price per bag drop from GH¢3,625 to GH¢2,587.</p>



<p>“The government and opposition are trying to shift blame in terms of cocoa pricing. The issue is not about politics. It’s a social contract between the government and us,” he stated.</p>



<p>He argued that farmers have consistently made sacrifices over the years and questioned why they should bear the brunt of global price reductions.</p>



<p>He also raised concerns about what he described as comparatively low producer prices and disparities in cost-cutting measures within the cocoa sector.</p>



<p>According to Mr. Asafo Adjei, the protest staged by farmers is not “petty politicking” but a legitimate call for the government to withdraw the new cocoa pricing and protect farmers’ livelihoods.</p>



<p>“As citizens who have sacrificed for decades, what do we truly gain from the state? This protest is not trivial politicking; the government must listen to our demands. We call on the government to withdraw the new cocoa pricing. It is evident that the existing social contract benefits the government, but if they truly wish to support farmers, they need to be consistent and fair in their commitments,” he said.</p>



<p>Cocoa farmers in the Western North Region staged the demonstration to press home their demands, urging government to act swiftly and ensure fair treatment for the farming community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Director of the Presidential Initiative in Agriculture and Agri-Business at the Office of the President, Peter Boamah Otokunor, has said the government has significantly transformed the agricultural sector within one year.</p>



<p>Speaking on&nbsp;<strong>Asempa FM’s Ekosii Sen show,</strong>&nbsp;Mr. Otokunor stated that food supplies are currently stable and prices have largely been controlled due to targeted investments in farming.</p>



<p>“In just one year, we have managed to transform the agricultural sector. Food supplies are now available, but since food crops are seasonal, it is essential to implement measures to avoid shortages. </p>



<p>&#8220;Currently, food prices are stable, and all the food in the markets was harvested in 2025. When investment is directed toward farming, the results become evident. The government’s performance will determine whether production will increase or decline,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr. Otokunor explained that one of the longstanding challenges in the sector has been the affordability and quality of farm inputs, many of which are imported.</p>



<p>However, he argued that the stabilisation of the cedi has reduced input costs and, by extension, the overall cost of production.</p>



<p>According to him, the improvements being witnessed are a direct result of deliberate government investment and effective agricultural policies.</p>



<p>“One major challenge we face is the affordability and quality of agricultural inputs. Any government that understands agribusiness can effectively manage the foreign exchange market, as most of our input supplies are imported. We have also worked to stabilise the currency, which has reduced the cost of inputs, leading to lower production costs.</p>



<p>“The positive outcomes we are witnessing are a direct result of government investment in the agricultural sector. Effective agricultural policy is crucial, and the results are becoming apparent quickly,” he stated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Deputy Finance Minister Thomas Nyarko Ampem has commended the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) for intercepting 12 articulated trucks suspected to be involved in transit diversion, describing the operation as a bold move to protect state revenue.</p>



<p>In a post on Thursday, Mr Ampem praised the enforcement team for their swift action, noting that the interception sends a clear signal about the government’s determination to curb revenue leakages and clamp down on transit diversion.</p>



<p>“Investigation is ongoing to identify the six outstanding trucks,” he stated.</p>



<p>He further disclosed that he has directed the Commissioner-General of the GRA to conclude investigations within one week, adding that two Customs officers connected to the matter are being tracked.</p>

<p>“We take these things seriously because the impact on our revenue is serious,” he stressed.</p>



<p>On his part, the Commissioner-General of the GRA, Anthony Kwasi Sarpong, warned businesses and traders to comply strictly with Customs laws and procedures.</p>



<p>He cautioned that the Authority would not hesitate to enforce the law against offenders.</p>



<p>“We will apply the law of confiscation. The full arms of the law will be applied,” he said, adding that the GRA will take decisive action against.</p>



<p>The enforcement exercise, carried out between 10:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. along the Dawhenya–Tema Road, was led by the Deputy Commissioner in charge of Operations. </p>



<p>The team included the Chief Revenue Officer, Preventive (Tema Collection), officers from Customs Headquarters and the Revenue Mobilisation Taskforce of National Security.</p>



<p>The 12 trucks form part of a consignment of 18 articulated vehicles that had been electronically gated out of the Customs system as transit goods. The cargo had been declared as goods in transit from Akanu and destined for Niger through Kulungugu.</p>

<p>However, the trucks were intercepted while moving without the mandatory Customs human escort, contrary to Ghana’s transit regulations.</p>



<p>The vehicles were loaded with 44,055 packages of edible cooking oil, tomato paste and spaghetti. Authorities estimate that the potential tax exposure linked to the consignment exceeds GH¢85 million.</p>



<p>Eleven of the trucks have since been secured at the GPHA Transit Terminal under strict Customs supervision, with support from the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority. One truck developed a mechanical fault during the operation, and arrangements are underway to transfer its cargo to another vehicle to ensure the goods remain secured.</p>



<p>Preliminary checks indicate that all 18 trucks were electronically cleared from the system, yet only 12 have been physically accounted for. Investigations are ongoing to trace the remaining six trucks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Centre for Democratic Development Ghana (CDD-Ghana) has cautioned that Ghana’s recent economic recovery under the John Dramani Mahama administration, though impressive on the surface, rests on what it describes as a “fragile foundation&#8221;.</p>



<p>In its one-year assessment released Thursday, February 19, the civil society group acknowledged that many Ghanaians are beginning to feel relief in the cost of living but warned that underlying fiscal and structural risks could threaten the gains.</p>



<p>In its strongest caution, CDD-Ghana said the apparent macroeconomic stability may not yet be durable.</p>



<p>“However, this stability is built on a fragile foundation,” the report stressed.</p>



<p>It explained that much of the cedi’s recent strength stemmed from gold reserve sales rather than deep structural transformation in manufacturing and exports.</p>



<p>The group also flagged labour market weaknesses, noting that most new jobs remain in the informal sector while about one-third of young Ghanaians are unemployed or out of school.</p>



<p>However, the report highlighted that falling inflation, the appreciation of the cedi and declining fuel prices have produced measurable price reductions in key sectors.</p>



<p>“For the first time in several years, many Ghanaians attest to experiencing a tangible fall in the cost of living,” the assessment noted.</p>



<p>Fuel prices dropped between four and eight per cent around December 2025–January 2026, triggering a 15 per cent reduction in commercial transport fares. Food inflation also plunged sharply from 28.3 per cent in January 2025 to 4.9 per cent by December 2025.</p>



<p>However, CDD-Ghana stressed that the benefits are uneven across the country, with some northern regions yet to experience the same price relief due to logistics bottlenecks and transport challenges.</p>



<p>The think tank credited the administration with achieving a significant fiscal reset in 2025.</p>



<p>Key gains highlighted include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Debt-to-GDP ratio falling from 61.8% to 45%</li>



<li>Treasury bill rates dropping from 30% to 11%</li>



<li>Budget deficit narrowing from 7.9% to 3.1%</li>



<li>Successful external debt restructuring boosting investor confidence</li>
</ul>



<p>Credit rating agencies Fitch Ratings and Moody&#8217;s subsequently upgraded Ghana to B- status, signalling improved global confidence.</p>



<p>CDD also pointed to strict commitment-based spending in 2025, which prevented the accumulation of new arrears.</p>



<p>Despite the progress, the group identified domestic revenue mobilisation as a major vulnerability.</p>



<p>Tax revenue currently stands at 16.1% of GDP, still below peers such as Senegal and Côte d&#8217;Ivoire, creating what the report calls a persistent “revenue lag&#8221;.</p>



<p>This shortfall, CDD warned, forces the government to rely on borrowing to finance spending, raising concerns about future debt accumulation.</p>



<p>The think tank specifically flagged the fiscal risks posed by large-scale programmes such as the GH₵13.85 billion Big Push infrastructure agenda and the MahamaCares health initiative.</p>



<p>“The general worry is that if the government doesn’t find a way to generate more revenues soon, these high-cost programs could eventually break the budget and undo the financial stability,” the report warned.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana described the creation of the Ghana Gold Board (GoldBod) in March 2025 as a landmark intervention that boosted exports, with small-scale miners shipping 103 tonnes valued at US$10.8 billion — surpassing large-scale mining output.</p>



<p>Yet the report raised environmental and governance concerns, warning the initiative could be unintentionally encouraging illegal mining.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, CDD warned that the government faces significant repayment pressures, about GH₵20 billion in 2026 and GH₵50.3 billion in 2027.</p>



<p>It said the administration must maintain strict fiscal discipline and accelerate growth to avoid slipping back into a debt trap.</p>



<p>“The test of the ‘Reset Agenda’ will not be in rhetoric but in concrete institutional reforms,” the report concluded.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana urged the government to move beyond short-term stabilisation and focus on value addition, job creation, and environmental protection to secure long-term economic resilience.</p>

<p>The government has reaffirmed its commitment to de-risk investment in Ghana’s tree crop sector as part of efforts to attract private capital, increase productivity, and strengthen value addition.</p>



<p>Deputy Minister for Finance, Thomas Nyarko Ampem, announced at the Tree Crop Summit held at the Accra International Conference Centre, where policymakers, agribusiness leaders, financial institutions and development partners gathered to deliberate on financing, sustainability and growth in the industry.</p>



<p>Addressing participants, Mr Ampem stressed that the government recognises the risks that have traditionally discouraged large-scale private investment in the sector and is taking deliberate steps to address them.</p>



<p>“Government is ready to de-risk investment in the tree crop sector to crowd in more private capital and boost production across the value chain,” he stated.</p>



<p>He explained that de-risking measures would include policy consistency, improved access to long-term financing, credit enhancement mechanisms, and support for outgrower schemes to protect both farmers and investors.</p>



<p>“We are committed to creating a predictable policy environment and strengthening institutions to ensure that investors have the confidence to commit long-term capital into the sector,” he added.</p>



<p>The Deputy Minister noted that Ghana’s tree crop industry, including cocoa, cashew, oil palm, shea, mango and rubber, holds significant potential for export diversification, job creation and rural industrialisation.</p>



<p>“The tree crop sector remains a critical pillar in our economic transformation agenda. If properly structured and financed, it can drive inclusive growth, create sustainable jobs, and improve livelihoods across rural communities,” Mr Ampem emphasised.</p>



<p>Stakeholders at the summit also discussed innovative financing models, climate-smart agriculture, and value addition strategies to reduce Ghana’s dependence on raw commodity exports.</p>



<p>Mr Ampem assured participants that the Ministry of Finance will continue collaborating with relevant agencies and the private sector to unlock funding opportunities and enhance risk-sharing frameworks.</p>



<p>“Our focus is to move beyond rhetoric to practical interventions that make the sector bankable and attractive to institutional investors,” he said.</p>



<p>The Tree Crop Summit forms part of broader efforts to reposition the sector as a viable and competitive investment destination capable of contributing significantly to Ghana’s economic resilience and long-term growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Member of Parliament for Damongo and Ranking Member on Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, Samuel Abu Jinapor, has disputed claims that Ghana’s newly commissioned Chancery in Addis Ababa is solely the achievement of the current administration.</p>



<p>In a<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1223802136543464&amp;set=a.537872435136441" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Facebook post</a> titled <em>“Setting the Records Straight on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1223802136543464&amp;set=a.537872435136441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghana’s Addis Ababa Chancery</a>”</em>, Mr Jinapor described comments made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, at the commissioning ceremony as “erroneous” and an “egregious misrepresentation of facts”.</p>



<p>The new Chancery, located in Addis Ababa, was recently commissioned amid public commendation of the government’s efforts to strengthen Ghana’s diplomatic presence in Ethiopia.</p>



<p>However, Mr Jinapor insisted that construction of the project began under the administration of former President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.</p>



<p>According to him, the sod-cutting ceremony was performed by President Akufo-Addo on 10th February, 2020 on the sidelines of the African Union Summit.</p>



<p>The event, he said, was witnessed by then Ethiopian President Sahle-Work Zewde and other senior officials from both Ghana and Ethiopia.</p>



<p>Mr Jinapor, who stated that he was present at the ceremony, recalled that President Akufo-Addo had at the time lamented Ghana’s failure to own a chancery building in Addis Ababa, given the longstanding relations between the two countries dating back to the era of Kwame Nkrumah and Haile Selassie.</p>



<p>He rejected suggestions that the project had a 10-year history from 2016, describing such claims as misleading.</p>



<p>Construction, he maintained, commenced in February 2020, immediately after the sod-cutting and had reached about 90 per cent completion by October 2024.</p>



<p>Mr Jinapor further indicated that the only delay in the project’s completion was related to the final payment of the contract sum during the 2024 general elections period.</p>



<p>He argued that if there had been any interruption in progress beyond that point, it could not be attributed to the previous administration.</p>



<p>“This is a national project commenced by the previous Government and completed by the current Government,” he stated, adding that acknowledging continuity in governance should not be viewed as partisan.</p>



<p>He described it as disingenuous to characterise the chancery as a “Mahama project” when, according to him, the current administration only completed the remaining 10 per cent of the work.</p>



<p>Mr Jinapor urged the Foreign Affairs Minister, as the country’s chief diplomat, to acknowledge what he termed “unimpeachable facts” surrounding the project’s origins and execution.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Founder and CEO of leading agribusiness firm, Agri-Impact Group, Dr. (h.c) Daniel Fahene Acquaye, has been appointed Chairman of the CSIR–Crops Research Institute (CRI) Management Board.</p>



<p>He was officially inducted into office on Thursday, February 19, 2026, in Kumasi.</p>



<p>In this role, Dr. Acquaye will lead an eight-member Board, providing strategic direction and governance oversight to one of Ghana’s foremost agricultural research institutions.</p>



<p>The board will, among other things, set and approve research priorities and policies, provide budget and financial management oversight, promote applied research and commercialisation, foster private sector partnership and enhance national visibility.</p>



<p>Dr. Acquaye’s appointment is seen as a strategic step toward strengthening research–industry collaboration and accelerating the commercialisation of agricultural innovation.</p>



<p>The Management Board includes:</p>



<p>Dr. Daniel Fahene Acquaye – CEO, Agri-Impact Group; Agribusiness Expert (Chairperson)<br>Dr. Baffour Asafo-Agyei – Retired Crops Research Scientist and Plant Breeder with local and international experience (Member)<br>Mr. Kojo Akoto Boateng – Consultant, Farmer, and Media Personality (Member)<br>Dr. Solomon Ansah – Director of Crop Services, MoFA (Member)<br>Prof. Marian Quain – Deputy Director-General, CSIR (Member)<br>Dr. Collins Tay – Director, CSIR–Soil Research Institute (Member)<br>Prof. Maxwell Darko Asante – Director, CSIR-CRI (Member)<br>Mr. Emmanuel Afriyie – Lawyer and Head of Administration, CSIR-CRI (Secretary to the Management Board)</p>



<p>About Dr. Daniel Fahene Acquaye</p>



<p>A distinguished agribusiness development and value chain expert, Dr. Daniel F. Acquaye brings on board over three decades of experience in enterprise development, youth empowerment, and agricultural transformation across Africa and the Caribbean.</p>



<p>He has consulted for leading global institutions, including the Mastercard Foundation, Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), USAID, ECOWAS, GIZ, AGRA, IFAD, UNDP, the African Development Bank, and the African Union, among others, with assignments spanning over 30 countries.</p>



<p>A key highlight of his career has been advancing Ghana’s medicinal and natural plant products onto the global stage through science-based and market-driven partnerships.</p>



<p>Through his subsidiary, Agribusiness in Sustainable Natural African Plant Products (ASNAPP), which began as a USAID-funded initiative operating in five African countries, he established strong collaborations with academic and research institutions such as Rutgers University (USA), Stellenbosch University (South Africa), KNUST, and other partners.</p>



<p>These partnerships led to ethnobotanical research, the establishment of a Genebank at KNUST, the cultivation of Cryptolepis for the Centre for Scientific Research into Plant Medicine, and the commercialisation of products such as kombo butter, Lippia herbal tea, grains of paradise, Xylopia, miracle berries, and Artemisia annua.</p>



<p>Within four years, exports of medicinal plants under the initiative increased from $3 million to $25 million, significantly expanding Ghana’s presence in international markets.</p>



<p>Dr. Acquaye also pioneered greenhouse farming models as part of a modern, climate-smart agribusiness strategy. Through ASNAPP and later Agri-Impact Ventures (now Agri-Impact Group), greenhouse production systems were introduced and scaled to support women, youth, and persons with disabilities, supplying high-quality vegetables to premium domestic and international markets.</p>



<p>Today, Agri-Impact Group manages greenhouse farms under its Fresh Logistics subsidiary, promoting technology adoption, year-round production, and youth employment.</p>



<p>In recognition of his exceptional contribution to youth empowerment and agribusiness development, he was recently honoured by the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) with a Doctor of Science (Honoris Causa) degree.</p>



<p>Under his leadership, Agri-Impact Group has mobilised over $100 million in agricultural project funding in the past five years, employs more than 150 staff, and is currently leading a transformative Mastercard Foundation–supported programme aimed at creating over 300,000 jobs for youth in Ghana, alongside supporting a World Bank–funded SME growth initiative in Jamaica.</p>



<p>His company has also partnered with the Ministry of Trade, Agribusiness and Industry (MoTAI) and other sector players to develop a National Agribusiness Policy for Ghana, and with the Ministry of Food and Agriculture to develop a Poultry Masterplan and a policy framework for the rice sector.</p>



<p>Dr. Acquaye’s new role at CSIR–Crops Research Institute positions him at the intersection of research, commercialisation, governance, and national development, an opportunity to further drive innovation, strengthen institutional performance, and advance Ghana’s green growth and agricultural transformation agenda.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>King Charles III&#8217;s brother, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, has been arrestedon suspicion of misconduct in public office.</p>



<p>Thames Valley Police confirmed it had arrested a man in his 60s in Norfolk on Thursday and was carrying out searches at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk. He remains in custody, it said.</p>



<p>King Charles III said the &#8220;law must take its course&#8221; in response to Andrew&#8217;s arrest and that the police had his &#8220;full and wholehearted support and co-operation&#8221;.</p>



<p>Police had previously said they were considering investigating Andrew over allegations relating to his association with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and were reviewing allegations he shared confidential material.</p>



<p>Communications between the pair featured among the tranche of files released by the US government.</p>



<p>This is the first time Andrew has been arrested. He has consistently and strenuously denied any wrongdoing.</p>



<p>Thames Valley Police said that, following a &#8220;thorough assessment&#8221;, a formal investigation had now been opened.</p>



<p>It also said earlier in February that it was assessing a separate allegation that a second woman was sent to the UK by Epstein for a sexual encounter with Andrew in 2010. The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time.</p>



<p>BBC News understands that Thames Valley Police contacted the Home Office to give them advance warning before Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested.</p>



<p>The arrest, which took place at Sandringham at 08:00 GMT on Thursday, is not in relation to any allegations of sexual offences.</p>



<p>Vehicles believed to be unmarked police cars were seen outside the King&#8217;s Norfolk estate, where the former prince has been living since leaving his home in Windsor, in Berkshire.</p>



<p>The BBC understands that Royal Lodge &#8211; Andrew&#8217;s former home in Windsor Great Park &#8211; is being searched by police. A number of uniformed officers have been seen beyond the gates.</p>



<p>Thames Valley Police said it was not naming the arrested man &#8220;as per national guidance&#8221;, and warned that as the case was now active, care must be taken to avoid being in contempt of court.</p>



<p>Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said: &#8220;We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Norfolk Constabulary told the BBC it was &#8220;supporting a Thames Valley Police investigation into misconduct in a public office&#8221;.</p>



<p>The former Duke of York served as the UK&#8217;s trade envoy between 2001 and 2011, travelling globally and enjoying privileged access to senior government and business contacts around the world.</p>



<p>In 2010, Andrew appears to have forwarded government reports from visits to Vietnam, Singapore and China to Epstein, files relating to the late financier recently released by the US Department of Justice appear to show.</p>



<p>The documents also appear to show Andrew forwarded information on investment opportunities in gold and uranium in Afghanistan to Epstein.</p>



<p>Under official guidance, trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial, or political information about their official visits.</p>



<p>King Charles said he learned of the news his brother&#8217;s arrest with the &#8220;deepest concern&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.</p>



<p>&#8220;As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter. Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.&#8221;</p>



<p>The BBC understands that the Prince and Princess of Wales support the King&#8217;s statement.</p>



<p>It is also understood that neither the King nor Buckingham Palace were given advance warning of Andrew&#8217;s arrest, which occurred on his 66th birthday.</p>



<p>The royals have been maintaining a business-as-usual approach, opting to continue with their engagements, despite the extraordinary developments of this morning.</p>



<p>The King, who had been attending a solo engagement to mark the start of London Fashion Week on Thursday, did not react to questions from reporters asking for his reaction to his brother&#8217;s arrest.</p>



<p>Queen Camilla was asked about the arrest of her brother-in-law as she left an engagement in Windsor on Thursday.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you concerned about Andrew&#8217;s arrest, your Majesty?&#8221; the Queen was asked as she got into a waiting car outside a lunchtime orchestral concert at Sinfonia Smith Square Hall. She was seen waving but did not respond.</p>



<p>Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing over his association with Epstein. He has not responded to the BBC&#8217;s requests for comment on the specific allegations in relation to the release of millions of Epstein files in January.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has told the BBC that he has submitted a five-page letter to several UK police forces providing new and additional information from the Epstein files.</p>



<p>In a statement, Brown says the new information is in addition to what he submitted to the forces last week, in which he &#8220;expressed my concern that we secure justice for trafficked girls and women&#8221;.</p>



<p>The brother of the late Virginia Giuffre, Sky Roberts has told BBC Newsnight that he believes his sister had been &#8220;vindicated&#8221; by news of Andrew&#8217;s arrest.</p>



<p>The former prince previously faced allegations from Virginia Giuffre, which were settled out of court.</p>



<p>She alleged she was made to have sex with Andrew on a number of occasions, including on Epstein&#8217;s private island Little St James in the early 2000s.</p>



<p>The settlement reached between the two made no admission of wrongdoing on Andrew&#8217;s part.</p>



<p>Despite acknowledging the reasoning behind Andrew&#8217;s arrest as &#8220;not a direct correlation&#8221; to Virginia&#8217;s allegations, Roberts heralded the moment as a &#8220;win for survivors&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t be here without her (Virginia). We wouldn&#8217;t be to a moment [sic] where this would have been investigated to this point&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Roberts also commended the King for his support of the investigation by Thames Valley Police, adding: &#8220;I say thank you to the King and to the Royal Family for standing behind survivors&#8221;.</p>



<p>Andrew stepped back from royal duties in 2019 as he said the allegations had become a &#8220;disruption&#8221; for the royal family.</p>



<p>He subsequently lost his military titles and royal patronages as Giuffre brought a civil action against him in the US in 2022.</p>



<p>Andrew was stripped of his princely title in October 2025, the same month Giuffre&#8217;s posthumous memoir was published and as fresh details about his association with Epstein came to light.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Centre for Democratic Development Ghana (CDD-Ghana) has urged sweeping institutional reforms to strengthen Ghana’s anti-corruption architecture, warning that the first year of the John Dramani Mahama administration shows both encouraging steps and significant gaps.</p>



<p>In its one-year governance assessment released on Thursday, February 19, the civil society organisation called for the urgent establishment of an Independent Anti-Corruption and Ethics Commission to consolidate the work of existing accountability bodies.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana recommended implementing the Constitutional Review Committee’s proposal to merge the currently fragmented mandates of the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO), and the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) into a single independent body.</p>



<p>The think tank argued that the present structure weakens coordination and effectiveness in tackling corruption.</p>



<p>It further proposed removing the Attorney-General’s prosecutorial authority over corruption cases and transferring that power to the proposed independent commission.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana also called for legal safeguards to prevent political interference in prosecutions.</p>



<p>“Ensure that the Attorney-General or any person exercising prosecutorial authority may not discontinue a commenced prosecution without leave of court,” the report recommended.</p>



<p>Beyond structural reforms, the organisation stressed the need for sustained financing of accountability institutions.</p>



<p>It urged the government to “provide adequate and sustained funding for accountability institutions, moving beyond rhetorical commitments to actual transfer of budgetary allocations.”</p>



<p>The report warned that chronic underfunding has historically undermined Ghana’s anti-corruption efforts.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana also pressed the government to fast-track the long-delayed Conduct of Public Officers Bill.</p>



<p>According to the group, the proposed law must contain “comprehensive provisions on ethics, asset disclosure, and conflict of interest” to close existing loopholes in the governance framework.</p>



<p>The think tank further called for robust implementation of the National Ethics and Anti-Corruption Action Plan (NEACAP 2026–2030), cautioning against repeating the shortcomings of the previous NACAP I.</p>



<p>In its overall assessment, CDD-Ghana acknowledged what it described as promising early signals by the Mahama II administration, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Limiting ministerial appointments</li>



<li>Launching a Code of Conduct for appointees</li>



<li>Supporting the OSP</li>



<li>Initiating asset recovery efforts</li>
</ul>



<p>However, it stressed that the administration’s flagship “Reset” agenda will ultimately be judged by concrete outcomes rather than policy announcements.</p>



<p>“The test of the ‘Reset’ agenda will not be in rhetoric but in concrete institutional reforms, consistent enforcement, and the political will to apply accountability standards uniformly across all actors in government,” the report concluded.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana pledged to continue monitoring the government’s performance, noting that citizens who have vested sovereignty in the administration expect measurable progress in the fight against corruption.</p>

<p>The Ghana Police Service has arrested a 39-year-old man described as a suspected narcotics kingpin following an intelligence-led operation in the Bono Region.</p>



<p>The suspect, identified as David Frimpong, was apprehended by officers from the Berekum Divisional Police Command at Nyamebekyere, a suburb within the Berekum Municipality.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1925-768x1024.png" alt="Police arrest alleged drug kingpin in Bono Region narcotics operation" class="wp-image-10032982364" title="Police arrest alleged drug kingpin in Bono Region narcotics operation" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1925-768x1024.png 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1925-225x300.png 225w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1925-105x140.png 105w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1925-94x125.png 94w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1925-188x250.png 188w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1925-113x150.png 113w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1925-318x424.png 318w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1925-38x50.png 38w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1925.png 960w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>



<p>According to a police statement issued on Thursday, February 19, officers acting on intelligence stormed the suspect’s residence — a semi-completed building — where he was believed to be operating from. Mr Frimpong reportedly attempted to flee upon sighting the police but was swiftly apprehended.</p>



<p>A thorough search of the premises uncovered what authorities described as significant quantities of suspected narcotic substances and materials used in drug preparation and distribution.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="862" height="1024" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1924-862x1024.png" alt="Police arrest alleged drug kingpin in Bono Region narcotics operation" class="wp-image-10032982362" title="Police arrest alleged drug kingpin in Bono Region narcotics operation" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1924-862x1024.png 862w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1924-252x300.png 252w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1924-768x912.png 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1924-118x140.png 118w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1924-105x125.png 105w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1924-210x250.png 210w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1924-126x150.png 126w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1924-357x424.png 357w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1924-42x50.png 42w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1924.png 1164w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" /></figure>



<p>Police disclosed that the search yielded:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Seven compressed slabs of dried leaves suspected to be Indian hemp</li>



<li>195 wraps of dried leaves</li>



<li>Three sacks containing additional quantities of dried leaves believed to be Indian hemp</li>



<li>A container of ‘groundnut cake’ toffee suspected to have been mixed with Indian hemp</li>



<li>Six pairs of scissors</li>

<p>All items have been retained for evidential purposes and will undergo forensic examination to confirm their composition.</p>



<p>Preliminary investigations suggest that Mr Frimpong is a dealer in narcotic drugs and is believed to have been distributing the substances within Berekum and surrounding communities.</p>

<p>In its one-year assessment of the Mahama administration, the policy think tank noted that the handling of arrests, detention and bail conditions—particularly in high-profile political cases—has generated debate about fairness, due process and the potential for institutional overreach.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>EOCO Under Scrutiny</strong></h3>



<p>The report highlights complaints from several suspects, many of whom served as appointees under the previous New Patriotic Party (NPP) administration led by former President Nana Akufo-Addo.</p>



<p>According to CDD, some of these individuals felt that the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) had abused its discretionary authority to detain suspects and impose bail conditions.</p>



<p>The matter reached a crescendo during the arrest and detention of the NPP’s Ashanti Regional Chairman, Bernard Antwi Boasiako, widely known as Chairman Wontumi. </p>



<p>His case, which attracted significant public and political attention, became emblematic of wider concerns about investigative discretion and perceived partisan application of the law.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Legal Gaps and Risk of Abuse</strong></h3>



<p>While existing legislation allows decisions by investigative bodies to be challenged in court, CDD argues that the current framework still leaves room for potential abuse. </p>



<p>The organisation warned that without clearer statutory safeguards, the exercise of powers relating to arrest, bail and remand may continue to provoke controversy and erode public confidence in the justice system.</p>



<p>The report emphasised that the perception of unequal or politically motivated application of the law can undermine democratic stability and trust in state institutions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CRC Proposals as a Remedy</strong></h3>



<p>As part of its recommendations, CDD pointed to proposals made by the Constitutional Review Commission (CRC), which it believes offer a pathway to reform.</p>



<p>Among the key suggestions is the passage of comprehensive legislation by Parliament to regulate arrest procedures, bail conditions, pre-trial detention and remand. Such a law would establish clear timelines and defined grounds for exercising these powers, thereby limiting arbitrary or prolonged detention.</p>



<p>The CRC further recommends the establishment of a similar statutory framework to guide prosecutions, ensuring consistency, transparency and accountability across the criminal justice process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Call for Parliamentary Action</strong></h3>



<p>CDD urged lawmakers to consider these proposals carefully, arguing that codifying clear standards would protect individual rights while preserving the legitimate powers of law enforcement agencies.</p>



<p>The think tank noted that strengthening legal safeguards in the pre-trial process is essential not only to protect suspects’ rights but also to reinforce public confidence in Ghana’s democratic institutions.</p>

<p>The Concerned Drivers Association of Ghana and other unions have commended the Accra Mayor, Michael Kpakpo Allotey, for clearing hawkers off Kinbu-Tudu Street, a move that has significantly eased traffic congestion in the area.</p>



<p>The praise follows a meeting between the union and the mayor, during which drivers highlighted the challenges they faced with hawkers occupying the streets.</p>



<p>Nii Ashie, Greater Accra Regional Chairman of the Concerned Drivers Association of Ghana, told Adom News that the mayor had fulfilled his promise to clear the roads, bringing relief to drivers.</p>



<p>“The road was blocked during and after Christmas, but the mayor came through,” he said.</p>



<p>Paa Willie, President of the Concerned Drivers Association, also lauded the efforts of Mayor Allotey and President John Mahama, noting that the streets are now clear and drivers are no longer harassed by police officers.</p>



<p>“The Accra Mayor’s efforts have made a huge impact, and we appreciate his leadership,” he stated.</p>



<p>He added that major traffic jams during the Christmas season on Kinbu-Tudu Street and at Makola had made commuting extremely difficult, but the situation has improved remarkably.</p>



<p>Paa Willie also expressed admiration for how the Mayor managed to get the market women to relocate from the street, calling him a strong and effective leader.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Centre for Democratic Development (CDD-Ghana) has raised concerns about persistent violence, institutional weaknesses and unresolved legal gaps in Ghana’s presidential transition process, in its one-year assessment of the Mahama administration.</p>



<p>In its review of developments, CDD-Ghana observed that transitions in the Ghana Fourth Republic—particularly between the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC)—have historically been marred by violence, political reprisals and governance disruptions.</p>



<p>According to the report, the 2025 transition was “not different from previous ones”. It cites contestation and violence surrounding parliamentary results in several constituencies, including the destruction of Electoral Commission result sheets, assaults on poll workers and what it described as an ineffective police containment strategy.</p>



<p>The period leading up to the inauguration of President John Dramani Mahama was characterised, CDD noted, by fear and uncertainty.</p>



<p>As has become typical during transitions, the think tank said marauding groups of party-affiliated vigilantes illegally entered public institutions in attempts to remove outgoing political appointees or secure employment allegedly promised by the incoming administration.</p>



<p>One of the most striking incidents cited was the storming of the offices of Ghana National Gas Company on December 10, 2024, by NDC supporters. The situation reportedly required a combined deployment of police and military personnel, who fired warning shots to disperse the group.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana further noted that such incidents continued even after President Mahama was sworn into office. </p>



<p>On January 15, 2025, the organisation issued a public statement urging the new government and the NDC to disband vigilante groups and allow the police to maintain law and order.</p>

<p>“Typical of the history of presidential transitions, almost no one has been held accountable for clearly criminal acts,” the report stated.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Legal and Constitutional Gaps</h3>



<p>Beyond the violence, CDD-Ghana highlighted long-standing constitutional and legal weaknesses that continue to undermine effective state transitions.</p>



<p>Although the Presidential (Transition) Act, 2012 (Act 845) was enacted to sanitise and formalise the handover process, CDD argues that it has only partially achieved its purpose. </p>



<p>While transitions at the apex of government have become more orderly—with structured transition teams and cordial engagements between outgoing and incoming administrations—the same cannot be said for the broader machinery of state.</p>



<p>A major recurring issue, the report notes, is the practice of last-minute appointments, contracts and financial commitments by outgoing governments. In the 2025 transition, disputes arose over payments and recruitment undertaken during the transition window.</p>



<p>The incoming administration subsequently revoked what it termed “last-minute appointments” made after January 7, 2025, a move that significantly affected many newly recruited public sector workers, particularly unemployed youth.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Governance Disruptions at Local and Corporate Levels</h3>



<p>CDD-Ghana also pointed to structural governance gaps created by mass dismissals and abrupt directives during transitions. Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) were instructed to hand over to District Coordinating Directors upon the assumption of office by the new President. Similar directives were issued to boards and chief executives of public corporations.</p>



<p>While these actions are common during political transitions, CDD argues that they create operational paralysis.</p>



<p>The removal of MMDCEs, for instance, disrupts the functioning of District Security Councils and other local governance mechanisms. Likewise, dissolving boards and removing chief executives of state-owned enterprises can halt even purely commercial operations, sometimes with contractual and financial consequences.</p>



<p>In some cases, replacing a board, appointing a chief executive or confirming a new MMDCE can take six months to a year, compounding governance uncertainty.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Council of State and Presidential Appointments</h3>



<p>Another area of concern is the sequencing challenge created under the Presidential Office Act, 1993 (Act 463), which requires presidential staff appointments to be made in consultation with the Council of State.</p>



<p>Incoming presidents typically prefer to constitute their own Council of State before making substantive appointments, meaning that key presidential staff often serve in an interim capacity for extended periods.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana believes these overlapping legal requirements contribute to avoidable governance delays at critical moments of state transition.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Proposed Reforms</h3>



<p>The organisation endorsed recommendations put forward by the Constitutional Review Committee (CRC), including proposals to amend Chapter Eight of the Constitution to restrict certain actions during the transition period—such as urgent appointments, contracts and financial commitments.</p>



<p>The CRC has also proposed fixed-term appointments for certain key officials that would not be coterminous with the President’s tenure, thereby reducing politicisation and disruption during transitions. </p>



<p>Additionally, the report recommends revising the Presidential (Transition) Act to extend its scope beyond the Presidency to encompass public and civil service and local government structures.</p>



<p>Further proposals include strengthening oversight of state enterprises through the State Interests and Governance Authority (SIGA), to ensure continuity and accountability.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A Call for Institutional Maturity</h3>



<p>CDD-Ghana warned that unless structural reforms are undertaken, Ghana’s democratic transitions will continue to be accompanied by instability, economic risk and erosion of public confidence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Centre for Democratic Development Ghana (CDD-Ghana) has raised fresh concerns about press freedom and the pace of anti-corruption reforms in its one-year assessment of the John Dramani Mahama administration.</p>



<p>In the report released on Thursday, February 19, the civil society group warned that the government has yet to fulfil key promises aimed at expanding civic space and strengthening the accountability framework.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana criticised what it described as the government’s failure to initiate the repeal of “all anti-press freedom laws” to reverse what it called a growing climate of fear and intimidation.</p>



<p>According to the organisation, there are worrying signs that the repealed criminal libel regime may be returning through the use of the publication of false news provision under the Criminal Offences Act.</p>



<p>The report noted that some cases that appear to be straightforward defamation disputes are being pursued as criminal matters by state security agencies.</p>



<p>“This is concerning because defamation matters must be tackled through civil action taken by respective aggrieved persons, whether they are public officials or not,” the assessment stated.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana cautioned that the involvement of security agencies in such cases is “undesirable because it often leads to the gagging of citizens and the shrinking of civic space.”</p>



<p>The think tank warned the trend could have a chilling effect on investigative journalism and whistleblowing activities if not urgently addressed.</p>



<p>On broader governance reforms, CDD-Ghana acknowledged the government&#8217;s decision to transition from the first National Anti-Corruption Action Plan (NACAP I) to the new framework, the National Ethics and Anti-Corruption Action Plan (NEACAP).</p>



<p>The group described the move — and the placement of the new framework under the Office of the President — as commendable and potentially capable of strengthening oversight.</p>



<p>However, it stressed that success would depend heavily on implementation.</p>



<p>“The proof will be in implementation,” the report emphasised, warning that the same challenges that weakened NACAP I — particularly underfunding and weak political commitment — must be “genuinely addressed, not just rhetorically.”</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana also pointed to delays in passing the long-promised Conduct of Public Officers Bill into law.</p>



<p>While acknowledging the launch of a Code of Conduct for Appointees, the organisation said the absence of a comprehensive legislative framework means a key manifesto pledge remains unfulfilled.</p>



<p>Analysts say the bill is widely viewed as central to tightening rules on conflicts of interest, asset declaration, and ethical standards in public office.</p>



<p>The latest assessment adds to ongoing debate about the government’s record on transparency, media freedom and institutional reform.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana is urging authorities to accelerate legislative action, safeguard press freedoms, and ensure the new anti-corruption framework is properly funded and backed by strong political will.</p>



<p>Observers say the coming months will be critical in determining whether the administration can convert policy commitments into measurable governance gains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A few days ago, Hon. Eric Edem Agbana, the Member of Parliament for Ketu North and a member of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Education, raised a red flag that every Ghanaian parent, teacher, and citizen should pay attention to. He called out the &#8220;dehumanising content&#8221; in one of our Social Studies textbooks for Junior High School students- specifically, a section that attempts to list the &#8220;benefits&#8221; Ghana derived fromcolonisationn.</p>



<p>For far too long, our educational system has allowed a dangerous narrative to fester: the idea that while colonisation was &#8220;tough,&#8221; it gave us roads, schools, and a legal system. This is a historical lie that we have swallowed for decades. It is a narrative that sanitises a crime against humanity. To suggest that colonisation had &#8220;well-intended benefits&#8221; is like thanking a thief for leaving a flashlight behind after emptying your house so he could see his way to the door. We must be clear: colonisation was an extractive, dehumanising business venture that was never meant to develop the African, but to deplete the African for the benefit of Europe. It is time we deconstruct this myth and take back the minds of our children.</p>



<p><strong>Economic Exploitation: The Infrastructure of Extraction</strong></p>



<p>The most common argument used to defend the colonial era is the infrastructure left behind. People point to the railways, the Takoradi ports, and the roads built by the British. But we must ask ourselves: why were they built?</p>



<p>If you look at the map of the colonial railway system, it doesn&#8217;t connect our people; it connects the resource-rich hinterlands to the coast. The railway was not built so that a trader in Kumasi could easily visit a relative in Accra. It was built to move gold, timber, and cocoa out of the country as fast as possible. The ports were not gateways for Ghanaian trade; they were exit points for our wealth.</p>



<p>This infrastructure was the machinery of a massive extraction project. To call these &#8220;benefits&#8221; is to ignore the motive. Like a farmer who fattens a chicken before the slaughter, the colonialists built only what was necessary to make the extraction of our riches more efficient. They didn&#8217;t prioritise local industries; in fact, they suppressed them to ensure we remained a market for their finished goods. This created a cycle of economic dependence that we are still struggling to break today. True development could have been achieved through equal cooperation and trade integration if the Europeans actually meant well, but their goal was expansion and domination, not partnership.</p>



<p><strong>Social Disruption: The Birth of the Identity Crisis</strong></p>



<p>Colonisation did not just take our gold; it tried to take our souls. It disrupted the very fabric of our social structures and governance. Before the &#8220;District Commissioner&#8221; arrived, we had sophisticated systems of accountability and communal living. The British replaced these with foreign laws and an &#8220;Indirect Rule&#8221; system that often turned our own leaders into puppet proxies for the Empire.</p>



<p>The most damaging part of this social disruption was the war on our identity. This is where the deep-seated inferiority complex in our society began. Our agents of socialisation- the schools, the churches, and the media-were used to tell us that everything African was &#8220;heathen,&#8221; &#8220;primitive,&#8221; or &#8220;backward.&#8221;</p>



<p>Think about the schools. Girls were forced to cut their hair to look &#8220;neat&#8221; according to Western standards, and our traditional clothing was demoted to &#8220;Friday wear&#8221; or something &#8220;informal.&#8221; We were taught to speak English with a certain accent to prove we were &#8220;civilised,&#8221; while our mother tongues were labelled as &#8220;vernacular&#8221;, and students were punished for speaking them. This was a deliberate foundation for neocolonialism. It taught the Ghanaian to hate his own reflection and exalt the white man&#8217;s lifestyle. We are now living in a society with a massive identity crisis, where we idolise the American lifestyle and Western capitalism without realising that these systems were often built on our backs.</p>



<p><strong>A suicidal Liberal Democracy, Political Oppression and the Illusion of &#8220;Development</strong></p>



<p>Ghana’s liberal democracy, codified in the 1992 Constitution, is a neocolonial-influenced document that forces the nation to adopt the political end-state of the West without its prerequisite economic foundation. Critically, no developed nation, from the United Kingdom and the United States to the &#8220;Asian Tigers&#8221; like South Korea and Singapore-achieved industrialization under a liberal democratic framework. Historically, these powers utilized centralized, one-party, or illiberal systems to enforce the structural discipline and long-term planning necessary for economic takeoff. They only adopted democratic pluralism after securing economic sovereignty.</p>



<p>In Ghana, however, this model was externally mandated through aid conditionalities, compelling the nation to &#8220;run&#8221; politically before it could &#8220;walk&#8221; economically. This has resulted in a &#8220;winner-takes-all&#8221; culture that fosters chronic &#8220;short-termism&#8221; and paralysing polarisation. While the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) is mandated by Act 479 to create long-term frameworks, these are routinely sacrificed for four-year electoral gains.</p>



<p>Successive administrations abandon vital national projects to satisfy partisan bases, ensuring that progress is perpetually reset with every change of government.</p>



<p>By clinging to this neocolonial relic, Ghana remains trapped in a cycle of dependency. The current democratic structure prioritises procedural &#8220;good governance&#8221; over the radical, disciplined mobilisation of resources required for true transformation. Until the nation reconciles its governance with the historical reality that development demands a period of concentrated, centralised focus, its full potential will remain suppressed by the very institutions designed to mirror Western ideals rather than Ghanaian realities.</p>



<p>Politically, Ghanaians were subjugated and denied basic rights in their own land. Any form of resistance was met with brutality. The &#8220;development&#8221; the colonial authorities spoke of was always biased. While they built schools like Achimota, the curriculum was designed to produce clerks, administrative assistants, and low-level officials-proxies who would help the British run the colony. They didn&#8217;t want to produce independent thinkers, engineers, or innovators who would challenge the system.</p>



<p>Even the infrastructure built in the hinterlands, which people often credit to the colonial government, was frequently the work of third-party altruistic groups like churches. And even then, much of it was tied to indoctrination- convincing the African that his salvation lay in a foreign culture.</p>



<p>The system was rigged from the start. Today, we hear people preaching about &#8220;willpower&#8221; and &#8220;hard work&#8221; as the only way to succeed. While hard work is good, we must realise that many of our systemic issues are not individual failures; they are systemic symptoms. People are struggling to make it in a system designed to hold them back. We have inherited a structure of &#8220;every man for himself&#8221; individualism that is the opposite of our communal roots.</p>



<p>This roadmap represents a radical departure from the neocolonial structures that have defined Ghana since the transition to the Fourth Republic. To reach our full potential, we must deconstruct the procedural &#8220;benefits&#8221; of a democracy that serves foreign interests and replace them with a decade of intentional mental liberation.</p>



<p><strong>THE ROADMAP: A PERIOD OF MENTAL LIBERATION</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Radical Curricular Deconstruction:</strong> We must purge the educational system of colonial-centric narratives that prioritise Western triumph. In alignment with the Education Act, 2008 (Act 778), we must shift from rote learning to critical consciousness. Students must study the Pan-Africanism of Kwame Nkrumah, the dependency theory of Walter Rodney, and the revolutionary humanism of Steve Biko and Patrice Lumumba to replace individualistic capitalism with communal self-worth.</li>



<li><strong>Reclaiming Socialisation Agents: </strong>Family, Religious and media institutions must be reoriented. Under Article 39(1) of the Constitution, the State is mandated to integrate customary values into national life. We must enforce proper family values, demand an end to the religious demonisation of indigenous spiritualities and utilise the media to flood the public sphere with communal values, ensuring that the &#8220;agents of socialisation&#8221; serve the national interest rather than foreign ideologies. This includes the strategic regulation of digital spaces, moving beyond the Electronic Communications Act, 2008 (Act 775, to actively filter content that contradicts the national agenda of mental liberation and cultural protection.</li>



<li><strong>Decolonising Teacher Pedagogy: </strong>Teacher training colleges must become laboratories for mental liberation. Teachers, as the primary architects of the national psyche, must be incentivised to deconstruct the &#8220;colonial mentality&#8221; that equates Westernisation with progress. They must be the frontline soldiers in dismantling the psychological chains of neocolonialism.</li>



<li><strong>Communalism over Individualistic Monopolies:</strong> We must dismantle the &#8220;big man&#8221; culture and the neoliberal monopolies that exploit the masses. Our goal is to produce practical humanists- politicians, leaders, engineers, doctors, and artists who view their competence and skills as tools for communal upliftment rather than personal accumulation at the expense of their neighbours.</li>



<li><strong>Constitutional Indigenisation: </strong>We must overhaul the 1992 Constitution to move beyond the &#8220;hybrid&#8221; Westminster-Washington model. This involves the formal integration of the Chieftaincy Act, 2008 (Act 759) into the legislative process, transforming the Council of State into a powerful chamber for traditional authorities to ensure that national laws reflect the indigenous &#8220;spirit&#8221; and ancestral wisdom rather than foreign legal transplants.</li>



<li><strong>Linguistic Sovereignty: </strong>Language is the carrier of culture. We must elevate Ghanaian languages from mere subjects to the primary media of instruction and official state business. By breaking the hegemony of English, we allow our people to think, innovate, and govern in the languages that carry our communal logic, thereby ending the alienation of the masses from the state.</li>



<li><strong>Economic Protectionism and Autarky: </strong>We must reject the neoliberal &#8220;open market&#8221; lies that keep us as raw material exporters. The state must aggressively protect local industries and prioritise intra-African trade, deconstructing the myth that &#8220;foreign direct investment&#8221; is the only path to prosperity. True potential lies in self-reliance and the strategic control of our own markets.</li>



<li><strong>The &#8220;enslaved psyche&#8221;</strong><br>This is a colonial byproduct where &#8220;evolutionary thrift&#8221; triggers a cognitive bias toward familiar stagnation. This psyche clings to the 1992 Constitution, fearing the risk of radical change. However, uprooting these structures without a &#8220;map&#8221; -a rigorous transitional governance framework-invites &#8220;Hobbesian strife,&#8221; where a power vacuum leads to state collapse. To avoid anarchy, we mustutilisee the Chapter 25 amendment architecture to transition from liberal democracy to indigenous communalism. This &#8220;map&#8221; ensures that dismantling neocolonial relics is a structured evolution toward our ancestral identity, preventing the chaos of a vacuum-led revolution.</li>
</ol>



<p>Conclusively, colonisation was a scourge, not a blessing. The &#8220;roads and railways&#8221; were just the chains used to haul our wealth away. We owe it to the next generation to ensure they do not grow up with the same inferiority complexes that have hindered our progress for so long.</p>



<p>We must be the ones to restamp our own identity. Our toils might not result in a perfect system within our lifetime, but we must do the work. The &#8220;house&#8221; (the global class system) is rigged, but our answer lies in unity and a conscious, deliberate effort to shape what our children believe about themselves. As the 1992 Constitution of Ghana suggests in Articles 25 and 38, the state has a duty to provide education that leads to the &#8220;full realisation&#8221; of rights and facilities. That realisation is impossible if the mind is still in colonial chains. It is time for a total mental overhaul. Let us start by recalling those books.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The former Chief Executive Officer of the defunct Menzgold Ghana Limited, Nana Appiah Mensah, also known as NAM 1, has told the High Court that the Bank of Ghana (BoG) advised his companies on their operational structure. </p>



<p>He is standing trial for allegedly using his companies to induce and defraud over 16,000 members of the public. </p>



<p>Appearing in the witness box to give his side of the story, NAM 1 was questioned by his lawyer, Paa Joy A. Boateng, during examination-in-chief about the incorporation status and licensing of Menzgold Ghana Limited.</p>



<p>The accused explained that Menzgold, originally incorporated as Menzbank Ghana Company Limited, intended to operate as the first “bullion” bank in West Africa, if not the entire continent.</p>



<p>In pursuit of this vision, NAM 1 told the court that the BoG had issued a publication listing Menzbank among unlicensed microfinance institutions.</p>



<p>“In response, Menzbank’s in-house counsel wrote to the BoG, citing the publication in the dailies and informing them that Menzbank was not a microfinance institution, requesting that our name be expunged from the list,” he said.</p>



<p>He added that the Central Bank responded by requesting supporting documents and invited him to a meeting.</p>



<p>“As a law-abiding entity, we submitted the Precious Minerals Marketing Company (PMMC) licence and all other documentation they requested, which they acknowledged. </p>



<p>&#8220;Menzgold was subsequently given an opportunity in the meeting, chaired by Mr Amoh Awuah and other officers of the Central Bank, to adequately address the issues, which we did to the best of our ability,” NAM 1 said, noting that the company was then known as Menzbank.</p>



<p>He further explained that the meeting resolved the mistaken listing of Menzbank as an unlicensed microfinance institution, attributing it to the name’s suggestion of a financial institution.</p>



<p>NAM 1 told the court that the Central Bank advised a slight adjustment to the company’s name.</p>



<p>“So more specifically, our team and that of the Central Bank collectively resolved that Menzbank with a ‘k’ would be changed to Menzbanc with a ‘c’ to ensure consistency, which is a cardinal element in business administration. So Menzbank was changed to Menzbanc on the advice of the BoG,” he said.</p>



<p>He further testified that BoG later convened a second meeting after several months to address public confusion over whether Menzbanc was a licensed financial institution.</p>



<p>“This was because the name ‘Menzbanc’ depicted a financial institution, and members of the public often called the Central Bank to enquire. Secondly, our gold jewellery products and tablets, which buyers could trade for extra value, gave the semblance of financial investment,” he explained.</p>



<p>After discussions, the Central Bank instructed that for the companies to operate without confusion, the sale of gold jewellery products should be separated from gold trading operations.</p>



<p>“In effect, it was the Bank of Ghana that advised the setting up of Brew Marketing Consult,” NAM 1 said.</p>



<p>The case has been adjourned to March 5, 2026, for further examination-in-chief.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>



<p>NAM 1 and two of his companies, Menzgold Ghana Limited (MGL) and Brew Marketing Consult Ghana Limited (BMCGL), face 39 charges, including selling gold without a licence, operating a deposit-taking business without a licence, inducement to invest, defrauding by false pretence, fraudulent breach of trust and money laundering.</p>



<p>The allegations relate to defrauding customers of various sums between 2016 and 2018, totalling GH¢340,835,650. NAM 1 has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is on bail of GH¢500 million with four sureties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A new one-year assessment of the Centre for Democratic Development Ghana (CDD-Ghana) has flagged what it describes as a major loophole in the government’s anti-corruption framework, warning that the GH₵20,000 gift threshold for ministers could weaken accountability safeguards.</p>



<p>In its evaluation of the John Dramani Mahama administration released on Thursday, February 19, the civil society organisation said the current limit set under the Code of Conduct for ministers is “alarmingly high” and risks opening the door to undue influence.</p>



<p>According to CDD-Ghana, allowing ministers to receive gifts valued up to GH₵20,000 without triggering serious scrutiny creates what it termed “significant loopholes for potential corruption&#8221;.</p>



<p>The think tank argued that international best practice typically favours much lower thresholds or outright bans on high-value gifts to public officials, especially those involved in procurement and policy decisions.</p>



<p>The organisation further expressed concern over what it described as the President’s inaction on mounting calls for a review of the threshold.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana noted that the continued silence on proposals to reduce the cap “partly undermines the credibility of the Code&#8221;, particularly at a time when public trust in anti-corruption efforts remains fragile.</p>



<p>Analysts say the issue has become a litmus test for the administration’s broader commitment to tightening ethical standards in public office.</p>



<p>Beyond the gift threshold debate, the report also pointed to delays in passing the long-anticipated Conduct of Public Officers Bill, describing the hold-up as a missed opportunity to strengthen Ghana’s accountability architecture.</p>



<p>The bill, if enacted, is expected to provide a more comprehensive legal framework governing conflicts of interest, asset declarations, and ethical conduct among public officials.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana warned that without the legislation, reforms risk remaining largely administrative rather than legally enforceable.</p>



<p>Anti-corruption advocates say the concerns raised could fuel renewed public debate about transparency standards within government, especially as Ghana continues to pursue fiscal consolidation and governance reforms.</p>



<p>The Mahama administration has repeatedly pledged to strengthen accountability systems, but civil society groups maintain that closing policy loopholes — including the gift threshold — will be critical to demonstrating tangible progress.</p>



<p>CDD-Ghana is urging the government to review the cap urgently and fast-track the Conduct of Public Officers Bill to reinforce public confidence in the country’s anti-corruption regime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), Dr. Jacob Paarechuga Anankware, surprised many people when he arrived at work riding a motorcycle.</p>



<p>Dressed in a formal suit and a certified helmet, Dr. Anankware carefully rode into the EPA premises. Staff and visitors quickly noticed his arrival, and conversations followed about leadership, simplicity, and safety on the roads.</p>



<p>Many described the moment as unusual for a senior public official, but also refreshing. Others praised him for wearing full protective gear and setting a good example for riders.</p>



<p>Speaking on the reason behind his motorcycle ride, Dr. Anankware explained that it was not a special or symbolic action.</p>



<p>“Periodically, I ride to work,” he said. “Riding makes me feel alert and improves my concentration. It also helps me appreciate other road users who are not in my position. Finally, it helps me get to work early, and I am able to move quietly without attention.”</p>



<p>He confirmed that the ride was not a one-time decision, adding that riding to work is part of his normal routine. “There was nothing special about today. It is one of my routines,” he said.</p>



<p>Although Dr. Anankware said he was not trying to promote a policy message, he noted that motorcycles generally use less fuel and can help reduce carbon emissions compared to bigger vehicles.</p>



<p>“Bikes use less fuel, and this has a catalytic effect on the carbon footprint left by big vehicles,” he explained, while stressing that he does not expect all government officials to ride motorcycles because of safety concerns and personal choice.</p>



<p>When asked if motorcycle use can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions in cities, his answer was, “definitely.”</p>



<p>He said the EPA is already leading efforts to promote green energy and cleaner alternatives. “We promote alternatives to fossil fuels because of their effects on the ozone layer, global warming, oceans, plants, animals, and even human survival on planet Earth,” he said.</p>



<p>Dr. Anankware explained that Ghana’s long-term plan is to achieve net-zero energy-related emissions by 2060, as outlined in the Ghana Energy and Investment Plan (2023–2060).</p>



<p>He added that in 2024, the government waived import duties on electric vehicles meant for commercial transport until 2032. According to him, John Dramani Mahama has also shown leadership by driving an electric car, a move he says has helped increase the number of electric vehicles in the country.</p>



<p>Dr. Anankware said road safety was one of the reasons he rode with a helmet. “Wearing a helmet is a basic requirement. It protects the rider from head injury in case of an accident,” he said.</p>



<p>He called for strict enforcement of helmet laws and sent a message to commercial motorbike riders, commonly known as Okada riders.</p>



<p>“My humble plea to all riders is to wear a helmet at all times, even for short distances. You never know when an accident will happen. The brain is the most important part of the body. Any injury to it can kill or permanently damage you.”</p>



<p>Dr. Anankware believes public officials should live in ways that match national goals. “Public officials should demonstrate simple and responsible living,” he said, praising President Mahama’s modest lifestyle and leadership style.</p>



<p>He also highlighted serious air pollution concerns, citing data from the World Health Organization (WHO), which shows that Accra is one of Africa’s fastest-growing cities, with road transport contributing a large share of fine air pollution.</p>



<p>“These statistics are worrying. It will take collective effort,” he said, calling on all Ghanaians to support efforts to protect the environment and reset the economy.</p>

<p>The National Service Authority (NSA), in partnership with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), has convened a high-level meeting to review and advance a new Work Readiness and Leadership Training Programme aimed at equipping Ghanaian graduates with the skills required for successful entry into the workforce.</p>



<p>According to a post shared on Facebook by the Authority, the initiative, designed to impact approximately 150,000 graduates each year, seeks to bridge the gap between academic training and the practical demands of Ghana’s evolving labour market. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Security expert Dr. Ishmael Norman has called on President John Dramani Mahama to appoint a woman as Ghana’s next Minister of Defence, highlighting the reputational and policy benefits such a move would bring.</p>



<p>Speaking in an interview on<strong> JoyNews’ The Pulse</strong>, Dr. Norman argued that it is time for Ghana to break the tradition of men occupying the Defence Ministry and for the President to select a capable female leader who understands policy, parliamentary procedures, and budgeting in the defence sector.</p>



<p>“It will be for reputational benefit, and this thing will be so high up before all women, all girls, that it will be amazing the benefits of that appointment. We are tired of men; appoint a woman, Mr. President. Please, please, appoint a woman,” he appealed.</p>



<p>On the specific female candidate he proposes, Dr. Norman named the Korle Klottey MP Dr. Zanetor Agyemang Rawlings. He highlighted her experience on the Defence and Interior subcommittee, the Intelligence subcommittee, and her participation in activities at the Ghana Armed Forces Staff College.</p>



<p>“She has quite a lot of qualifications,” he said. “She has proven her worth as a medical doctor, parliamentarian, and disciplined professional.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is not an iota of any bad thing said about her. She has been groomed for that role, and it is high time she is elevated to that position.”</p>



<p>Dr. Norman also referenced Ghana’s affirmative action law, noting that women should occupy at least 25% of top positions in every organization, a target that has not yet been met in the defence sector.</p>



<p>He urged patience, however, acknowledging that the final decision rests with President Mahama and the Council of State, and emphasised the importance of careful consultation before appointing the next Defence Minister.</p>



<p>When asked about Deputy Defence Minister Ernest Bronya Genfi, Dr. Norman described him as being careful and diplomatic in his role, particularly given the sensitive circumstances surrounding the ministry.</p>



<p>He praised him for his professionalism and commitment, noting that any future appointment would require the consultation of the President, the Council of State, and the military leadership.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A proposed Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill triggered heated exchanges in Parliament, as the government moves to restructure Ghana’s national security architecture and change the name of the National Investigations Bureau (NIB) back to Bureau of National Intelligence (BNI).</p>



<p>The bill, laid before Parliament by the Minister for the Interior, Muntaka Mohammed-Mubarak, on Thursday, February 19, seeks to address what the government describes as public confusion between the National Investigations Bureau (NIB) and the National Investment Bank, which share the same acronym.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ej4E6KqEbKg?si=O93bkzJ_FBZB_qtm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>Under the proposed law, the intelligence agency will revert to the name Bureau of National Intelligence (BNI), distinct from its former historical title, Bureau of National Investigation.</p>



<p>The bill also proposes a major restructuring of national security governance by scrapping the Ministry for National Security, with oversight functions to be exercised through the Presidency.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="956" height="625" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka.png" alt="Majority, Minority clash over bill to revert NIB name to BNI and overhaul national security structure" class="wp-image-10032982379" title="Majority, Minority clash over bill to revert NIB name to BNI and overhaul national security structure" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka.png 956w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-300x196.png 300w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-768x502.png 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-459x300.png 459w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-214x140.png 214w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-150x98.png 150w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-218x143.png 218w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-649x424.png 649w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-330x216.png 330w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-225x147.png 225w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-217x142.png 217w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-340x222.png 340w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-229x150.png 229w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Muntaka-55x36.png 55w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 956px) 100vw, 956px" /></figure>



<p>Presenting the bill, Mr. Mohammed-Mubarak argued that the reforms are necessary to streamline coordination and avoid institutional conflicts.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, we have a situation where you say NIB, people are wondering whether you are talking about the bank or the security agency. So one of the significant things we are trying to do is to reintroduce the name BNI… Bureau of National Intelligence,” he said.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ss_ZNTT1Hk?si=-12jpZMRYoBro-V8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>He added that the new structure is intended to prevent conflict between a Minister for National Security and the National Security Coordinator, stressing that coordination should be firmly anchored under the President with ministerial oversight rather than a standalone ministry.</p>



<p>However, the proposals immediately drew strong opposition from the Minority, who described the bill as flawed, overly centralising power, and lacking safeguards.</p>

<p>Former Defence Minister, Dominic Nitiwul, questioned the policy rationale behind the reforms, warning that the changes could create instability and weaken accountability.</p>



<p>“If in four years you are no more in power, are we expecting a new government to also bring a new Act to reflect their direction?” he asked.</p>



<p>“It will be dangerous for this nation to make that office and agency so powerful without proper accountability. It’s a misplaced priority, and if you do that, you’ll suffer.”</p>

<p>Minority Leader Alexander Afenyo-Markin also rejected the bill, arguing that it is politically motivated rather than driven by evidence-based governance.</p>



<p>“The memorandum before us does not provide any empirical evidence to suggest that Act 1030 has failed,” he said.</p>



<p>“So much power is being given to the coordinator, and it is not clear how his powers are going to be fettered. </p>

<p>&#8220;Without clear responsibility, accountability and oversight, this becomes problematic. When citizens’ rights are abused, it will be justified in the name of national security.”</p>



<p>He called for further consultations and amendments to incorporate concerns raised by the Minority.</p>

<p>Responding to the criticism, the Majority Leader, Mahama Ayariga, defended the bill, describing it as a correction of what he termed a “historical wrong” created by the previous administration.</p>



<p>“We decided to cut down the number of ministers, and among the ministries we guillotined was the Ministry for National Security,” he said.</p>



<p>“What you [NPP] did was to force the hand of a President to appoint a Minister for National Security. It was a wrong thing for us to have done as a Parliament, and this historical wrong has to be corrected.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Director-General of the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC), Dr Audrey Smock Amoah, has emphasised the need for strict compliance with planning guidelines and improved performance standards to ensure that development plans translate into tangible results.</p>



<p>Delivering a presentation on Plan Preparation, Annual Progress Reports (APRs), and the Regional Integrated Plan, on Thursday, 19th February 2026, Dr Amoah highlighted L.I. 2232, which governs the preparation of APRs. She commended the Eastern Region for its strong performance, noting that most APRs submitted last year were rated excellent, very good, or good.</p>



<p>However, she stressed that rankings alone are not enough.</p>



<p>“We want to get to a point where, apart from the rankings, when we step into the districts or the regions, we see actual development,” she stated, explaining that APRs must comprehensively capture annual activities, financial performance, implementation challenges, and recommendations for improvement.</p>



<p>Dr Amoah further announced that several districts had successfully secured certification of their development plans, while others were yet to address outstanding review comments.</p>



<p>“We are still waiting for you to address your comments so that you receive your certificates,” she urged, applauding compliant districts and noting that the Regional Coordinating Council had also attained certification.</p>



<p>On her part, the Eastern Regional Minister, Rita Akosua Adjei Awatey, underscored the importance of coherent and well-aligned development planning, cautioning against the persistent challenge of abandoned projects.</p>



<p>“Where there is one consolidated, comprehensive, and collectively owned development plan, the likelihood of project abandonment significantly reduces,” she said.</p>



<p>Earlier, the NDPC team paid a courtesy call on the President of the Eastern Regional House of Chiefs, who underscored the critical need for a long-term, sustainable approach to development. Reflecting on agricultural practices, he observed that while farmers may sell their produce to the highest bidder today, such short-term gains could prove costly in the future.</p>



<p>“In ten years, the farmers could be the poorest,” he cautioned, stressing that true growth must safeguard future livelihoods rather than focus solely on immediate profits.</p>



<p>He emphasised that sustainable development remains key to ensuring lasting economic progress for communities across the region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minister for Sports and Recreation, Kofi Adams, says legislation of Ghana&#8217;s sports fund is not enough to drive growth in the sector without real financial commitment.</p>



<p>Speaking in Parliament on Thursday, 19 February, Mr Adams said passing the Sports Fund Bill must be matched with practical investment if Ghana is to unlock the economic potential of sport.</p>



<p>He made the remarks as the country prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, where Ghana has been drawn in Group L alongside Panama, England, and Croatia. The tournament, which begins in June, will be the Black Stars’ fifth appearance on football’s biggest stage.</p>



<p>Mr Adams said funding would be central to Ghana’s participation.</p>



<p>“Ghana has qualified for the World Cup; funding will be a key component for our participation and it is in that spirit, Speaker, I make this statement,” he said.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zIxXTTSJsUY?si=Wa_TDixYmlSFrUPw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>He warned that law alone cannot transform the industry.</p>



<p>“Legislation alone does not finance sports, commitment does. Globally, the sports industry exceeds $500 billion in value yet on our continent, sports contribute less than 0.5% to GDP in most countries &#8211; not because we lack talent, not because we lack passion, but because we have not yet built a financing system that matches our ambition.”</p>



<p>According to the minister, the proposed Ghana Sports Fund would provide a transparent and accountable framework to support infrastructure development, school and grassroots sport, elite athlete preparation, welfare systems and recreation.</p>



<p>“The Ghana Sports Fund provides us that system. It creates a transparent and accountable framework to support infrastructural development, school and grassroots sports, elite athlete preparation, welfare systems, and recreation,” he added.</p>



<p>Mr Adams also commended the National Investment Bank for donating 100,000 Ghana cedis to the fund, describing the gesture as a demonstration of leadership from the financial sector.</p>



<p>He said meaningful reform in Ghana’s sports industry would depend not only on Parliament passing the bill, but on sustained financial backing from both government and private institutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Deputy National Communications Director of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Kamal-Deen Abdulai, has questioned the clarity and application of Article 146 of Ghana’s 1992 Constitution, describing it as potentially “the most confused position” in the supreme law at the moment.</p>



<p>Article 146 of the 1992 Constitution outlines the procedures and grounds for the removal of justices of the superior courts and other high-ranking officials on the basis of stated misbehaviour or incompetence.</p>



<p>Speaking on the Joy News AM Show on Thursday, 19th February, Mr Abdulai raised concerns about what he suggested could be a selective interpretation of the constitutional provision governing the removal of certain public officers, including the Chief Justice.</p>



<p>“Is there a case of cherry-picking or selective application of the law here when it comes to Article 146 of the Constitution? It’s a question somebody would ask,” he said.</p>



<p>“Lawyers have also exposed their positions on what we heard yesterday and read. That looks like the most confused position of the Constitution at the moment is Article 146.”</p>



<p>Mr Abdulai noted that many legal commentators had weighed in on the matter, offering differing interpretations of what amounts to “stated misbehaviour”.</p>



<p>“Many people have actually been there. And some of these, when they come out, the legal pundits or legal luminaries will come out with their various angles. What actually constitutes a misbehavior is what the CJ is saying,” he stated.</p>



<p>Referring to a recent communication emanating from the Jubilee House, Mr Abdulai cited portions of what has been described as the “Green Letter,&#8221; which addressed a petition seeking a prima facie determination.</p>



<p>“That look, from what we have received and read, it is evident on the face of it that some constitutional questions were raised, administrative questions were raised, but they don&#8217;t meet the threshold to determine a prima facie case,” he said.</p>



<p>He added that a full publication of the reasoning behind the decision would be instructive.</p>



<p>“It will be interesting to have a full report. Because I know that when justices of their caliber sit, they don&#8217;t just write English. They derive their positions from laws; they derive their positions from determined cases, which are precedents. And they derive their positions from textbooks and all that.”</p>



<p>Mr Abdulai stressed that transparency in such high-level constitutional matters was crucial, particularly after the President had been furnished with the report.</p>



<p>“It’s just unfortunate what the law says. Whether after furnishing the President with it, the President would make it available for all of us to read, to get to know the ratio or the reasons behind the decision of the Chief Justice,” he said.</p>



<p>Quoting directly from the letter issued from the Presidency, he read, &#8220;While the allegations raised serious constitutional and administrative questions, they do not, on their face, meet the threshold required for a prima facie determination of stated misbehavior or incompetence, warranting that a committee be set up to inquire into the petition.”</p>



<p>“The petition largely rests on conclusions of unlawfulness and bad faith without establishing a preliminary level, clear facts, demonstrating intentional wrongdoing, or a manifest inability to perform constitutional functions,” he continued.</p>



<p>“Even if the commission&#8217;s actions or inactions are assumed to be erroneous, controversial, or suboptimal, such shortcomings do not automatically translate into stated misbehavior.”</p>



<p>Mr Abdulai argued that these conclusions had triggered broader public debate about consistency in applying Article 146, particularly in light of previous determinations by the Council of State.</p>



<p>“Thus, I’m saying that some lawyers, after reading this, say, At what point can a stated misbehavior actually be impugned?” he said.</p>



<p>“Not only lawyers, but commonsensical people would also say this. Because yesterday, we were told that same Article 146, Council of State, was able to establish, if you like, a prima facie case against not just anybody, but a certain Chief Justice.”</p>



<p>He contrasted the current reasoning with earlier cases where alleged breaches of administrative procedures, including travel policies, were said to have met the threshold for a prima facie case.</p>



<p>“And when ratios were asked to be given, we’re told that she traveled, and the travel policy was infringed upon. We’re told that there was some administrative infringement, and then if this one talks about some administrative questions and infringements, and yesterday was actually meeting the threshold of a prima facie, why not today?” he queried.</p>



<p>Mr Abdulai stated that his concerns were not directed at any particular institution.</p>



<p>“I’m not actually against the OSP or the EC, but I’m trying to say that our law should actually be so clear to us that it will not leave us in a state of confusion, as it were,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Chairman of the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC), Dr Nii Moi Thompson, has reiterated the need for a consolidated long term national development plan to replace Ghana’s fragmented and largely unimplemented past frameworks.</p>



<p>During the ongoing regional consultative engagement with key stakeholders in the Eastern Region on Thursday, 19 February 2026, Dr Thompson delivered a presentation on the proposed long term national development plan, emphasising the importance of a clear national vision and noting that policy discontinuity has undermined national progress.</p>



<p>He referenced previous initiatives such as Ghana Beyond Aid and Vision 2057, stressing that long term planning is not about predicting the future, but about defining goals and working systematically to achieve them.</p>



<p>“We cannot proceed with an incrementalist approach to development,” he noted, warning that without deliberate and sustained planning, Ghana risks stagnation.</p>



<p>He identified informality as “the weakest link” in the country’s development, observing that while 92 per cent of businesses operate in the informal sector and employ nearly 90 per cent of the workforce, they contribute only about 20 per cent to GDP due to low value addition.</p>



<p>Dr Thompson therefore urged district assemblies to prioritise economic formalisation, business development, and models such as the Start and Improve Your Business initiative to enhance productivity and competitiveness.</p>



<p>Dr Thompson also called for greater adoption of technology, particularly Artificial Intelligence, to modernise planning processes and improve efficiency.</p>



<p>He disclosed that the Commission has already begun exploring AI tools following a recent introductory session.</p>



<p>“It will help to minimise the workload and expedite certain processes for us,” he noted, adding that he has personally used AI to summarise district development plans effectively.</p>



<p>He expressed optimism that once fully institutionalised at the Commission level, the innovation would be extended to the regions and district assemblies.</p>



<p>Turning to governance and maintenance culture, he emphasised that development is not only about constructing new infrastructure but also about preserving existing assets. Drawing on the broken window theory, he cautioned that neglecting minor defects inevitably leads to systemic deterioration.</p>



<p>“The second you see this, you are supposed to prevent it,” he remarked, citing road encroachment, school erosion, and the destruction of pavements as examples of avoidable decline that ultimately place additional burdens on government resources.</p>



<p>The Regional Minister described the Commission’s long term national development plan as timely and commendable, emphasising that its success will depend on effective implementation, inclusivity, and accountability.</p>



<p>“A better tomorrow is dependent on our collective decisions and actions today,” she concluded, urging stakeholders to ensure that development remains people centred, strategic, and sustainable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana’s Minister for Sports and Recreation, Kofi Adams, says he will donate two months of his salary to the Ghana Sports Fund.</p>



<p>He made the announcement while speaking in Parliament, where he stressed the need for the Sports Fund Bill to be passed into law. He said the fund could make a strong contribution to Ghana’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and help transform sports financing in the country.</p>



<p>The minister made the pledge after commending the National Investment Bank for donating GHC 100,000 to the fund.</p>



<p>“I will donate two months of my salary to the Ghana Sports Fund effective February 2026,” Mr Adams said.</p>



<p>“If we expect the private sector to invest, if we expect (Sports) Federations to reform, if we expect young athletes to commit, then leadership must also commit.”</p>



<p>He also called on fellow lawmakers and government officials to support the initiative.</p>



<p>“I respectfully call on members of this house, Ministers of State and the Executive to support this fund in tangible ways. Government has delivered the framework,” he added.</p>



<p>The Ghana Sports Fund is designed to mobilise resources to support sports development, infrastructure, and athlete welfare across the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Majority Chief Whip in Parliament, Rockson Dafeamekpor, has promised to donate three months of his salary to help the growth of the Ghana Sports Fund. </p>



<p>The Ghana Sports Fund, passed into existence earlier this year, serves as the dedicated source of funding for the development of sports in Ghana.</p>



<p>The multi-source Sports Development Fund is designed to support athlete welfare, infrastructure development, grassroots sport, and systematic talent identification.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the National Investment Bank (NIB) made its first donation to the fund, expressing its commitment to the development of sports in the country. </p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zIxXTTSJsUY?si=Wa_TDixYmlSFrUPw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>That action has been followed by Dafeamekpor, who has also decided to donate to the fund.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Chief Whip has asked me to announce that he is committing three months of his salary [to the Ghana Sports Fund,&#8221; Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga said in Parliament on Thursday. </p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">‘I will invite the Special Prosecutor to come and find out how he’s going to survive for the three months’ – Majority Leader Mahama Ayariga jokes after his Chief Whip donated three months’ salary to the Sports Fund<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JoySports?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#JoySports</a> <a href="https://t.co/EY2zqOjjg1">pic.twitter.com/EY2zqOjjg1</a></p>&mdash; #JoySports (@JoySportsGH) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoySportsGH/status/2024512389937344642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>The bill’s passage marks a significant policy move aimed at addressing longstanding funding challenges in the sector, with the government hopeful that the fund will provide a more structured and reliable source of support for Ghanaian sports.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If the moral arc of a nation is to bend toward justice, the instruments of its political parties must first be tempered in the fires of integrity.</p>



<p>The National Democratic Congress has signaled that its commitment to the &#8220;Reset Ghana&#8221; agenda is not merely a pulpit for public consumption, but a mandate for internal purification.</p>



<p>By moving with surgical speed following the submission of a preliminary investigative report to the Functional Executive Committee, the party has transformed a localized inquiry into a national crusade for democratic sanctity.</p>



<p>​The directive, issued by General Secretary Fifi Fiavi Kwetey, marks a pivotal transition from reactive discipline to proactive reformation. What began as a specific probe into allegations of financial inducement during the Ayawaso East Constituency internal elections has now blossomed into a comprehensive overhaul of the party’s electoral culture.</p>



<p>The &#8220;canker&#8221; of vote-buying, as the party candidly describes it, is no longer being treated as a peripheral nuisance but as a systemic threat that requires the most formidable intellectual and political shielding.</p>



<p>​To this end, the committee led by the venerable Hon. Kofi Totobi Quakyi has been significantly bolstered with a new guard of legal and political heavyweights.</p>



<p>The inclusion of Hon. Rockson-Nelson Dafeamekpor, Hon. Barbara Serwaa Asamoah, Mahdi Gibrill, and Courage Kwabena Barlon creates a formidable brain trust tasked with a singular, high-stakes mission: to research, consult, and legislate internal measures that ensure leadership is won through the strength of ideas rather than the weight of a purse.</p>



<p>​This expansion is a masterstroke of political symbolism that mirrors the government’s broader aspirations for the Republic. A party that seeks to reset a nation’s economy must first prove it can reset its own soul.</p>



<p>By empowering this committee to &#8220;consult widely&#8221; and deliver &#8220;sustainable measures,&#8221; the NDC is attempting to bridge the chasm between constitutional ideals and the gritty reality of political competition.</p>



<p>It is a recognition that the credibility of a government is inextricably linked to the purity of the process that birthed its leadership.</p>



<p>​Ultimately, the Functional Executive Committee’s decision rests on the conviction that a &#8220;Reset&#8221; is only as strong as the foundation upon which it is built.</p>



<p>As the party prepares for future electoral cycles, this reconstituted body serves as both a shield against corruption and a beacon of a new political era.</p>



<p>The message is clear: the NDC is no longer content to merely talk about change; it is doing the difficult, necessary work of building a house of integrity from the inside out, ensuring that the democratic culture of the party remains a standard-bearer for the nation at large.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The New Patriotic Party (NPP) Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, Vincent Ekow Assafuah, has alleged a conflict-of-interest situation at the crisis-hit Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) involving some top management members.</p>



<p>In an extensive post on his Facebook page on Thursday, the MP alleged that the Chief Executive Officer of COCOBOD, Dr Randy Abbey, and his Acting Deputy in charge of Finance and Administration, Ato Boateng, are linked to a company, Atlas Commodities Limited, which he claims is involved in the purchase of cocoa.</p>



<p>According to the MP, a search at the Registrar-General’s Department reveals that both the Chief Executive Officer and his acting deputy are associated with Atlas Commodities. </p>



<p>He further alleges that the company has been buying cocoa using funds meant for Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs), including Produce Buying Companies (PBCs).</p>



<p>The MP published what he described as evidence of a waybill issued in the name of Atlas Commodities Limited, indicating the movement of cocoa from Kedjebi within the 2025/2026 crop season.</p>



<p>The document shared by the MP allegedly references 800 bags of Grade One cocoa, and he raised “legitimate questions” about the operational role of the private company within the cocoa purchasing chain.</p>

<p>Below is the full article by the MP:</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p><strong>BIG SCANDAL LOOMING AT COCOBOD</strong></p>



<p>One of the reasons cocoa farmers continue to endure hardship under the current COCOBOD administration is what appears to be blatant insensitivity and possible abuse of office.</p>



<p>Serious concerns have emerged regarding the leadership of COCOBOD under Randy Abbey and his deputy, Mr Ato Boateng, Acting Deputy Chief Executive (Finance &amp; Administration), whose established professional association with Atlas Commodities Limited is confirmed by records at the Registrar-General’s Department and further corroborated by publicly available information, including a simple Google or AI search, which shows that he has been the company’s Chief Executive Officer since 2018.</p>



<p>Attached is a waybill issued in the name of Atlas Commodities Limited indicating the movement of cocoa from Kedjebi within the 2025/2026 crop season. The document references 800 bags of Grade One cocoa, raising legitimate questions about the operational role of this private company within the cocoa purchasing chain.</p>



<p>It is alleged that funds meant for Licensed Buying Companies, including PBCs, to purchase cocoa were instead redirected to this private entity, with cocoa allegedly hoarded in anticipation of future price increases.</p>



<p>These alleged activities are said to be taking place in parts of the Central and Eastern Regions, raising concerns about the scale of the operation.</p>



<p>COCOBOD is the regulator of all Licensed Buying Companies. Therefore, how can the regulator of the industry be seen to operate, directly or indirectly, as a buying company within the same system it supervises? If true, this would represent a serious conflict of interest and a breach of regulatory integrity.</p>



<p>Further claims suggest that Atlas Commodities Limited does not operate its own warehouses but may be relying on existing PBC warehouse facilities.</p>



<p>Most concerning is the allegation that Atlas Commodities may be operating within warehouses registered under PBC. COCOBOD regulations require that every warehouse be registered under a specific Licensed Buying Company. If a warehouse is registered under PBC, it should not be used for the storage, grading, sealing or processing of cocoa belonging to another company.</p>



<p>If proven, such an arrangement would constitute a serious regulatory breach and raise critical questions for the district Quality Control Officers responsible for oversight.</p>



<p>Additionally, it is being alleged that the Chief Executive has withheld a task force report related to these matters, preventing the public from knowing the full extent of its findings.</p>



<p>These are grave concerns that demand urgent and independent investigation. The matter has reportedly been brought to the attention of the Jasikan and Hohoe Police Stations.</p>



<p>Cocoa farmers deserve transparency, accountability and protection from any actions that undermine their livelihoods.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Residents of Atwima Behenease, a community in the Atwima Kwanwoma Municipality of Ashanti Region, are pleading with the government to intervene and rehabilitate the critically damaged &#8220;Abɔgyesɛ&#8221; River Bridge.</p>



<p>The bridge is on the edge of a disaster, coming under the strain of the recent heavy rains.</p>



<p>This has left residents worried and stranded, as transportation to access essential services has halted.</p>



<p>The bridge serves as a crucial link for surrounding communities, including Atwima Boko, Twedie, Trabuom, and Nkawie, facilitating the movement of people and goods.</p>



<p>A visit to the bridge revealed that it has been severely damaged by heavy rains, with both sides washed away, leaving only a narrow passage for vehicles and pedestrians.</p>



<p>Afia Akyaa, a resident, made an urgent plea to the government to intervene and repair the bridge, which is critical for Atwima Behenease and surrounding communities.</p>



<p>&#8220;The condition of the bridge is extremely hazardous, and we&#8217;re calling on the authorities to take immediate action, rather than waiting for disaster to strike,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Kwadwo Mensah, another resident, shed light on the appalling condition of the road, stating that it&#8217;s in a really bad shape.</p>



<p>&#8220;The entire road is in a terrible state, so if they can&#8217;t manage to fix it all, the least they could do is repair the bridge, which is a major concern for us&#8221;.</p>



<p>Kwaku Antwi, a former unit committee chairman for Akyeremade-Kwanwoma Electoral Area, stated that the bridge has been in a state of disrepair for 8 months now.</p>



<p>He said the community, led by the queen mother and elders, has reached out to the relevant authorities, including the DCE, MP, and Feeder Roads, but no action has been taken to fix the bridge.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just two weeks ago, two cars, one of which was carrying students, nearly crashed on the bridge. It was only God&#8217;s intervention that prevented the accident from happening, otherwise, we might have lost lives.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every time we approach the authorities, they assure us that plans are underway to fix the bridge, but it seems like they&#8217;re just paying lip service. It&#8217;s frustrating because it feels like they are waiting for a disaster to happen before taking real action, then they&#8217;ll probably show up with condolences and promises of help. Meanwhile, we&#8217;re the ones living with the risk every day,&#8221; he lamented.</p>

<p>Ghana’s Minister for Sports and Recreation, Kofi Adams, has pledged to donate two months of his salary to the newly established Sports Fund, following the passage of the Sports Fund Bill by the Parliament of Ghana.</p>



<p>Speaking on the floor of Parliament, Mr Adams described the fund as a critical step toward revitalising sports development in the country and ensuring sustainable financing for athletes and federations.</p>



<p>The Minister said his decision to commit two months of his salary was a personal demonstration of support for the initiative and a call to action for other stakeholders to contribute towards the growth of sports in Ghana.</p>
