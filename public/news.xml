<p>A gas explosion has torn through an apartment building in Pakistan’s largest port city of Karachi, killing at least 13 people, including women and children, and injuring several others after part of the structure collapsed, police and rescue officials said.</p>



<p>The explosion happened on Thursday in a residential area of Karachi, the capital of the southern Sindh province, according to local police chief Rizwan Patel.</p>



<p>Rescuers were still removing rubble to search for any survivors trapped under the debris, he said. The search-and-rescue operation was ongoing.</p>



<p>Most houses and apartment buildings in Karachi, like elsewhere in Pakistan, are supplied with natural gas for cooking. However, many households also rely on liquefied petroleum gas cylinders because of low natural gas pressure.</p>



<p>In July, a&nbsp;gas explosion following a wedding reception&nbsp;at a home in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, killed eight people, including the bride and groom. The blast occurred as guests had gathered to celebrate the couple, authorities said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has moved from warnings to enforcement, shutting down 16 food service establishments across the Greater Accra Region on Wednesday, February 18, for operating without valid Food Hygiene Permits.</p>



<p>The action comes exactly two weeks after the Authority issued a public notice stating that, effective February 1, all non-compliant facilities would face immediate closure.</p>



<p>In a statement posted on its official Facebook page, the FDA confirmed it had followed through on that directive.</p>



<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffdaghana%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0uWVpJn1ZqGtFSJSS8zeLcj4jCvQbYTjLqPFKZvfwpbsXeAKfPtJVcQPtqEG4GahWl&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=500" width="500" height="812" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>



<p>Among the 16 establishments closed during the exercise were several well-known spots, including: The Cheesecake House, Dolce Frizzante, Onda, Alora Beach Resort.</p>



<p>“Two weeks after our notice to the public… we have taken action,” the FDA stated. “Today, 16 non-compliant food service establishments in Greater Accra Region… were shut down for failing to meet regulatory requirements.”</p>

<p>The enforcement drive goes beyond upscale restaurants and lounges. The FDA’s directive applies to a wide range of food-related businesses, including: Hotels and event caterers, Traditional “chop bars” and snack bars, Food vans and bakeries, Online food vendors, Canteens in schools, hospitals, and offices.</p>



<p>The Authority said the closures are necessary to protect consumers and maintain standards across the food supply chain.</p>

<p>“We remain committed to protecting public health and ensuring that all food service providers operate in strict compliance with good hygiene practices,” the Authority reaffirmed.</p>



<p>The FDA has urged operators who have not yet regularized their documentation to do so immediately to avoid similar enforcement action.</p>



<p>The affected establishments are expected to remain closed until they meet all regulatory requirements and obtain valid Food Hygiene Permits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>URGENT NEED FOR THE AMENDMENT OF THE ARCHITECTS ACT, 1969 (NLCD 357)</p>



<p>Your Excellency,<br>Your recent visit to the Ministry of Works, Housing and Water Resources (MWHWR), where you<br>received a briefing on the Ministry’s mandate, progress, and challenges, is both timely and welcome.<br>The challenges facing the Ministry and the nation as a whole will benefit from continued engagement<br>and the steady implementation of solutions. At the heart of Ghana’s housing, infrastructure, and urban development challenges lies a deeper problem that is rarely confronted directly.</p>



<p>While most built-environment regulatory frameworks have been updated to reflect modern governance and constitutional standards, the Architects Act, 1969 (NLCD 357), remains frozen in time. Enacted 57 years ago, well before the coming into force of the 1992 Constitution, the law continues to regulate a critical segment of the construction industry despite being outdated and constitutionally vulnerable. It no longer aligns with Ghana’s democratic order, contemporary governance standards, or the realities of the modern professions in the construction sector.</p>



<p>The consequences are real and costly:</p>



<p>Constitutional tensions arising from provisions that compel membership in voluntary<br>associations as a condition for practising a profession, limiting freedom of association. </p>



<p>Weak and undemocratic governance structures that limit accountability and access to justice,</p>



<p>Regulatory blind spots that leave key actors, architectural technologists, draughtsmen, and interior<br>designers, and thousands of first-degree architecture graduates, largely unregulated. </p>



<p>Institutional overlaps that blur the line between regulation and associations undermine public trust.</p>



<p>Your Excellency, Ghana cannot meaningfully address its housing deficit, urban congestion, or infrastructure quality while operating under laws that no longer serve the public interest. The continued postponement of legislative reform in this area is no longer neutral; it is harmful.</p>



<p>We respectfully call for your visit to the Ministry to mark a decisive turning point, with the following steps urgently required: </p>



<p>A clear executive signal for the comprehensive review and reform of the Architects Act, 1969.</p>



<p>A transparent, inclusive stakeholder process led by the Ministry, in collaboration with the Attorney-General and Parliament. </p>



<p>A modern regulatory framework aligned with the 1992 Constitution, democratic governance, and international best practice.<br>This is a moment for leadership, not gradualism. The built environment shapes lives, safety, and economic growth. Ghana cannot afford further delay. </p>



<p>History will remember not the briefing received, but the action taken.</p>

<p>South Korea’s former President Yoon Suk-yeol has been found guilty of masterminding an insurrection and sentenced to life in prison over his imposition of short-lived martial law in 2024.</p>

<p>“The declaration of martial law resulted in enormous social costs, and it is difficult to find any indication that the defendant has expressed remorse for that,” Presiding Judge Ji Gwi-yeon told the court on Thursday.</p>



<p>“As to defendant Yoon Suk-yeol, the crime of insurrection leadership is established,” the judge said.</p>



<p>“We sentence Yoon to life imprisonment.”</p>



<p>The Seoul Central District Court ruled that Yoon was the leader of the December 3, 2024 insurrection in a case where prosecutors had sought the death penalty for the disgraced ex-president, who was impeached and removed from office over his declaration of martial law.</p>



<p>The court found that the core fact of Yoon’s martial law case was that he sent the military to the National Assembly in December 2024, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported.</p>

<p>The court also ruled that Yoon intended to prevent and paralyse the National Assembly from functioning properly for a significant period of time, but rejected the special prosecutor’s claim that Yoon planned to establish a long-term dictatorship, according to Yonhap.</p>



<p>Yoon, 65, had maintained his innocence throughout his court appearances, arguing that he had presidential authority to declare martial law and that his decision was aimed at preventing opposition political parties from obstructing the work of government.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Deputy Minister for Food and Agriculture, John Dumelo, has called on Ghanaian youth to take advantage of expanding opportunities within Ghana’s agricultural sector, stressing that farming remains one of the most viable and sustainable business ventures in the country.</p>



<p>Addressing a town hall meeting organised by The Ghanaian Farmer in partnership with the People Building Institute on Saturday, February 14, 2026, at the British Council in Accra, Mr Dumelo emphasised that agriculture must be viewed not merely as subsistence work but as a serious and profitable enterprise.</p>



<p>He noted that government initiatives are increasingly structured to make the sector more attractive to young people, offering access to land, training, improved seedlings, mechanisation services, and financial support schemes.</p>



<p>“The National Youth Authority, Ghana Enterprise Agency, Outgrower Value Chain Fund (OVCF) at the Ministry of Agriculture, have money from donor partners, given to banks to lend to farmers. When you approach them with good plans after starting your farm already, it’s easy to get the loans and grants.”</p>



<p>According to him, young people interested in agriculture can engage with district agricultural offices, register with relevant farmer groups and cooperatives, and participate in government-backed programmes designed to support start-ups and agribusiness expansion.</p>



<p>“The opportunities are there,” he said. “From crop production to livestock, poultry, aquaculture, agro-processing and agritech, there is room for innovation and growth.”</p>



<p>Mr Dumelo underscored the importance of repositioning agriculture as a modern business driven by technology, value addition and strong market linkages.</p>



<p>He encouraged the youth to explore dry season farming and areas such as greenhouse farming, irrigation, digital marketing of farm produce and food processing, which offer higher returns and year-round income potential.</p>



<p>“Dry season farming is the best. Sometimes when I go to the North, the market women prepay for produce before the farmer starts. Once you have your farm close to the water body, acquire a pump and you will make a lot of money,” John Dumelo advised.</p>



<p>He further highlighted that agriculture remains indispensable because of its central role in national food security and economic stability.</p>



<p>“People eat every day,” he stressed. “That alone should tell you that agriculture will always be relevant. It is not a seasonal business; it is a necessity.”</p>



<p>The Deputy Minister urged financial institutions and private sector actors to support young agripreneurs with affordable credit and mentorship, while also encouraging participants to adopt a long-term vision with workable plans when entering the sector.</p>



<p>The town hall meeting assembled farmers, investors and agritech companies along the agriculture value chain in Ghana.</p>



<p>They engaged the Deputy Minister on issues including access to capital, post-harvest losses, market access and climate change resilience.</p>



<p>He discussed available financial packages from state agencies specifically designed for the youth.</p>



<p>While addressing the disappearance of local seeds based on a question from a participant, he said climate change is a major factor.</p>



<p>“That’s why we brought improved seeds to withstand Ghana’s temperature and rainfall patterns. These seeds are not GMO. They’re locally produced for efficiency,” the Deputy Minister added.</p>



<p>Organisers of the program, The Ghanaian Farmer and People Building Institute said the forum formed part of efforts to bridge the gap between policymakers and young farmers, and to inspire more youth to see agriculture as a viable career path to create jobs and reduce unemployment.</p>



<p>They disclosed that the town hall meeting with policy makers will be replicated across the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canine (K9) Unit of the Narcotics Control Commission (NACOC), in collaboration with its Enforcement Unit stationed at Kotoka International Airport (KIA), has intensified behavioural detection operations at the airport.</p>



<p>The move is aimed at reinforcing Ghana’s commitment to combating narcotics trafficking through its primary international gateway, spearheaded by the Commission.</p>



<p>The operation focused on identifying inbound and outbound passengers who displayed behavioural indicators commonly associated with drug trafficking. Officers deployed trained sniffer dogs, advanced scanning equipment, and profiling techniques to support the exercise.</p>



<p>The operation enabled officers to closely monitor passenger movements while ensuring minimal disruption to airport activities.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="732" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1855-1024x732.png" alt="NACOC steps up K9 Operations at Kotoka International Airport to curb drug trafficking" class="wp-image-10032981803" title="NACOC steps up K9 Operations at Kotoka International Airport to curb drug trafficking" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1855-1024x732.png 1024w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1855-300x214.png 300w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1855-768x549.png 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1855-1536x1097.png 1536w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1855-420x300.png 420w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1855-196x140.png 196w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1855-150x107.png 150w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1855-210x150.png 210w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1855-594x424.png 594w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1855-330x236.png 330w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1855-340x243.png 340w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1855-55x39.png 55w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1855.png 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Although the exercise focused on selected airlines, individuals identified as persons of interest were subjected to further investigation regardless of the airline or flight. This, NACOC said, underscores its non-discriminatory, intelligence-driven approach.</p>



<p>The intelligence-led searches were conducted at strategic locations within the airport, including Aviance, a key ground-handling facility. These targeted checks formed part of a broader security strategy aimed at closing operational gaps often exploited by drug traffickers.</p>



<p>In addition to enforcement activities, officers used the opportunity to educate passengers and airport workers on substance abuse, the dangers of drug trafficking, and the legal consequences of narcotics-related offences. </p>

<p>The visibility of the K9 Unit was deliberately increased to deter potential traffickers and reinforce public confidence in NACOC’s operations.</p>



<p>Throughout the exercise, officers demonstrated professionalism, balancing firmness with respect for passenger rights and aviation security protocols. Searches were conducted using both canine (K9) detection and scanning systems to ensure thorough but efficient screening.</p>



<p>The operation led to the seizure of quantities of pethidine and morphine, both controlled substances under Ghana’s narcotics laws. The seizures highlight the effectiveness of intelligence-led enforcement and canine-assisted searches.</p>

<p>The exercise underscores NACOC’s resolve to strengthen surveillance at ports of entry and exit, disrupt transnational drug trafficking networks, and protect Ghana’s international image. Similar intelligence-driven operations will continue at airports, seaports, and land borders across the country.</p>



<p>NACOC has encouraged the public and industry stakeholders to cooperate with its officers as it intensifies efforts to prevent the use of Ghana’s transport hubs for illicit drug trafficking.</p>

<p>The bond hearing for former Finance Minister Ken Ofori‑Atta in the United States is set to take place today, February 19, 2026, as a federal judge tackles the question of whether Ghanaian authorities have filed proper proof of an extradition request.</p>



<p>Judge David A. Gardey told lawyers handling the former minister’s immigration case that the court “cannot act on assertions without proof”, demanding that documented evidence of an extradition request be submitted <em>by today</em> before he considers any decision on bond or release.</p>



<p>The hearing follows a closed-door court session on January 20, where the judge paused consideration of Ofori-Atta’s bail application after state attorneys opposed his release, citing the pending extradition effort by Ghana.</p>



<p>Mr Ofori-Atta, who served as Finance Minister in the previous New Patriotic Party (NPP) government, has been detained by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) since early January while his immigration status is reviewed. Prosecutors say his visitor visa was revoked, leaving him without a lawful basis to remain in the country.</p>



<p>His lawyers argued in the January hearing that he has cooperated with authorities and is pursuing legal avenues, including an adjustment of status petition that would allow him to remain in the US under current immigration law. </p>



<p>Ghanaian authorities have separately moved to secure his extradition to face those charges, a process that hinges on formal documentation now due before the judge’s ruling. </p>



<p>In a related development, INTERPOL recently removed a Red Notice against Ofori-Atta, a move his lawyers say was based on the notice’s “predominantly political” character.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The governing National Democratic Congress (NDC) has extended heartfelt greetings and best wishes to Muslims in Ghana and across the world as they commence the holy month of Ramadan.</p>



<p>In a statement dated February 19, the party congratulated the Muslim Ummah on the beginning of the sacred period of fasting, prayer and spiritual reflection.</p>



<p>Describing Ramadan as a time of “fasting, prayer, reflection, sacrifice and renewed devotion to Allah,” the NDC said the holy month embodies values that are critical to national development.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="741" height="1024" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8842-741x1024.jpeg" alt="NDC wishes Muslim community peaceful and blessed Ramadan" class="wp-image-10032981763" title="NDC wishes Muslim community peaceful and blessed Ramadan" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8842-741x1024.jpeg 741w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8842-217x300.jpeg 217w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8842-768x1061.jpeg 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8842-1112x1536.jpeg 1112w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8842-101x140.jpeg 101w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8842-90x125.jpeg 90w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8842-181x250.jpeg 181w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8842-109x150.jpeg 109w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8842-307x424.jpeg 307w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8842-36x50.jpeg 36w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_8842.jpeg 1179w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /></figure>



<p>“It is also a time that reminds us of the enduring values of compassion, humility, generosity, discipline, and peaceful coexistence — virtues that are essential to national unity and development,” the statement emphasised.</p>



<p>The party acknowledged what it described as the significant contributions of the Muslim community to Ghana’s democratic journey, social cohesion and economic growth.</p>



<p>“The NDC acknowledges and deeply appreciates the significant contributions of the Muslim community to Ghana’s democratic journey, social cohesion, and economic growth,” the statement said, adding that prayers for peace and stability remain invaluable to the nation’s progress.</p>



<p>Encouraging Muslims to remain steadfast throughout the fasting period, the NDC prayed for divine strength and blessings for the Ummah.</p>



<p>“As you embark on this spiritual journey, we pray that Allah grants you strength, good health, and abundant blessings. May this holy month renew our collective commitment to justice, inclusiveness, and the building of a more united and compassionate Ghana,” it noted.</p>



<p>Signed by the party’s General Secretary, Fifi Fiavi Kwetey, the statement reaffirmed the NDC’s commitment to promoting equality and opportunity for all citizens.</p>



<p>“The NDC remains steadfast in its commitment to championing policies and programmes that promote equality, opportunity, and improved livelihoods for all, regardless of religious or ethnic background,” it stated, wishing the entire Muslim Ummah a peaceful and rewarding Ramadan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Executive Director of the Ghana Real Estate Developers Association (GREDA), Samuel Amegayibor, has endorsed the proposal to cap rent advance payments at one year under the government’s new Rent Bill.</p>



<p>Speaking on the ongoing debate over rent reforms, he described the proposed one-year cap as fair, noting that while landlords often require two years’ advance notice and sometimes more, where possible, such requirements place enormous financial pressure on tenants.</p>



<p>“For me, I think the one-year rent advance is fair. Landlords normally take two years’ advance now and more if they have the opportunity. But they have to appreciate the fact that it doesn’t come easy for people to raise those huge funds just to settle rent,” he stated.</p>



<p>Mr Amegayibor stressed that raising large lump-sum payments to cover multiple years of rent is a significant challenge for many Ghanaians, particularly young people just beginning their careers.</p>



<p>“It’s a mutual consideration between parties. If they understand the need to limit or not demand too much at a time, I think it will go a long way to help, especially the young ones who have just started life,” he said.</p>



<p>He explained that when monthly rents running into several thousands of Ghana cedis are multiplied by 12 or even 24 months, the total figure becomes excessively high for most households.</p>



<p>“When you charge several thousand a month, multiplied by 12 and 24 and all that, I think it is a bit on the high side for people,” he added.</p>



<p>His comments come at a time when the government is pushing for reforms under a new Rent Bill to limit rent advances to a maximum of one year, introduce penalties for violations, and strengthen regulation in the rental housing sector.</p>



<p>The proposed reforms have sparked mixed reactions among stakeholders, but Mr Amegayibor’s endorsement signals growing support within the real estate development community for measures to ease tenants&#8217; financial burden while promoting fairness in the housing market.</p>

<p>While you might be familiar with localization and translations when it comes to expanding your small business, what a lot of people get wrong is the fact that it’s far more than just this. </p>



<p>Like, if you want to grow your business online, sure, that means you ship to more places, which makes sense. Plus, that means you market to more places too, but that, at the same time, is where more work happens. </p>



<p>Well, specifically, compliance. While you might be totally compliant selling in the area that you’re living, be it that country, state, region, etc. But that doesn’t inherently mean you’re good to go everywhere, because there’s actually a lot you need to consider before you expand to each new place you want to see. But what exactly?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understand what actually changes when you expand</h2>



<p>Selling into a new place isn’t just “more customers.” It can mean new tax rules, different consumer protection expectations, and sometimes totally different product requirements. </p>



<p>Even inside the US, states don’t play by one shared rulebook on sales tax, and once international orders get involved, VAT or GST and customs steps can show up too. It can be pretty overwhelming, like you’re opening the floodgates, sure, there’s no doubt about that. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tax rules just don’t care </h2>



<p>It&#8217;s super mean to say here, but it really doesn’t matter how small your business is, you’re getting taxed. So, the US will be used in this example because a lot of e-commerce from other countries like to try and eventually reach the US market (and other times Americans love buying from abroad too). </p>



<p>In the US, a big compliance trigger is economic nexus, which is basically when sales into a state cross a threshold that requires registration and collection, even without a physical presence. </p>



<p>And of course you need to also keep in mind that fifferent states have different thresholds, and they can change, so it’s not something to guess on either. That means that <a href="https://www.xero.com/us/guides/california-sales-tax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California sales tax</a> isn’t the same as the taxes in New York aren’t the same either. </p>



<p>When it comes to the EU, there’s taxes there as each country has its own taxing system as well. Sure, it&#8217;s all really overwhelming, and thankfully, thanks to AI and ecommerce software, these things are usually built in for business owners. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Shipping and returns need to match where customers live</h2>



<p>Yeah, this one isn’t all that fun either, but expansion also affects what’s promised at checkout. And of course, this all includes delivery timeframes, duties and import fees, return windows, and refund rules allof which matter more once the customer isn’t local. </p>



<p>If the store is shipping internationally, it helps to be clear about who pays duties and taxes, because customers hate surprise fees, and then support tickets start piling up. And of course, each country, logistic company, and<a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/shipping-carrier?term=&amp;adid=775809778528&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> carrier is going to vary </a>by price and rules, too.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Data privacy and email rules can shift </h2>



<p>Which is really scary, because at any time, all of this can change. Anyways, selling in new regions can also mean different expectations around privacy, cookies, and marketing. </p>



<p>Like email marketing is a good example. What’s normal in one place can require different consent language in another, especially once international customers are in the mix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minority Caucus has also criticised what it describes as inadequate human rights protections in the Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025, cautioning that vague language in the draft law could be used to suppress legitimate civic activity.</p>



<p>The Caucus pointed to provisions framed broadly around protecting against activities intended to undermine the constitutional order.</p>



<p>According to the Minority, without precise definitions, such wording could be interpreted expansively to target lawful opposition, protest or activism.</p>



<p>“Although political neutrality is mentioned, there are no enforcement mechanisms or clear sanctions for breaches,” it stated.</p>



<p>The Minority also warned about the structure of Regional and District Security Councils, which are chaired by Regional Ministers and Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives.</p>



<p>It argued that the absence of cross-party representation creates a risk of politicisation, particularly during election periods.</p>



<p>“During sensitive periods, especially elections, such structures can be misused to suppress lawful political activity,” the Caucus cautioned.</p>



<p>On financial accountability, the Minority maintained that Parliament’s approval of intelligence funding must be matched with structured reporting mechanisms.</p>



<p>It argued that while the Auditor-General audits agency accounts, the Bill does not require detailed budget breakdowns or the publication of non-sensitive audit findings to enable effective oversight.</p>



<p>“Ghana needs a security framework that is strong and professional, but also accountable and firmly anchored in the Constitution,” the Minority stressed, reiterating its position that the Bill must be amended to safeguard civil liberties while strengthening national security.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Two persons have been confirmed dead, while 14 others sustained injuries following a road accident on the Ho–Aflao Highway in the Volta Region.</p>



<p>The crash occurred when a Ford Transit vehicle with registration number VR-322-20 collided with a Honda Civic, registration number GN-1166-16.</p>



<p>Preliminary information indicates that the Ford Transit, which was transporting passengers, crashed into the saloon car while attempting to overtake another vehicle.</p>

<p>The Minority Caucus has described the surveillance and warrant provisions in the Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025, as “deeply troubling”, warning that they risk undermining privacy rights and civil liberties.</p>



<p>Addressing Parliament during debate on the Committee’s report, the Minority cautioned that applications to intercept communications under the Bill could be made not only to a Superior Court judge but also to a senior police officer.</p>



<p>“Administrative authorisation for such intrusive powers undermines the principle that only a court should approve invasions of privacy,” the Caucus stated.</p>

<p>The Minority further criticised the provision for broad warrants that may apply to a class of persons and last up to sixty days.</p>



<p>According to the Caucus, the Bill does not require authorities to notify affected persons after surveillance ends, nor does it mandate periodic review of the necessity of surveillance or the destruction of irrelevant data.</p>



<p>The Caucus also raised concerns about restrictions on parliamentary scrutiny, noting that security officers could refuse to produce documents before Parliament if the Speaker certifies disclosure as prejudicial to national security.</p>



<p>“There is no requirement to provide reasons or even redacted versions,” it pointed out, adding that the Bill imposes criminal sanctions of five to ten years for certain disclosures without explicitly protecting whistleblowers.</p>



<p>“National security and civil liberty are not opposing goals. We can protect our nation without eroding the freedoms of our people,” the Minority stressed, calling for judicial-only warrant authorisation and stronger whistleblower protections.,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minority Caucus has warned that the proposed Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025 could open the door to politicisation and weaken financial transparency within Ghana’s intelligence framework.</p>



<p>It argued that the structure of Regional and District Security Councils, chaired by Regional Ministers and Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs), creates risks during politically sensitive periods.</p>



<p>“During sensitive periods, especially elections, such structures can be misused to suppress lawful political activity,” the Caucus cautioned, noting the absence of cross-party representation requirements.</p>



<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dDWlwZ9M3qR4UMVPNZYM-mMEn3-k2udK/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>



<p>The Minority further criticised what it described as insufficient human rights safeguards in the Bill. It said broad phrases such as protecting against activities intended to undermine the constitutional order could be interpreted to target legitimate opposition, protest or civic activism.</p>



<p>“Although political neutrality is mentioned, there are no enforcement mechanisms or clear sanctions for breaches,” it observed.</p>



<p>On financial accountability, the Minority noted that while Parliament approves funding for intelligence agencies and the Auditor-General audits their accounts, the Bill does not require detailed budget breakdowns or structured reporting to enable effective scrutiny.</p>



<p>It also highlighted the absence of obligations to publish non-sensitive audit findings or provide structured briefings to relevant parliamentary committees.</p>



<p>“Ghana needs a security framework that is strong and professional, but also accountable and firmly anchored in the Constitution,” the Minority concluded. “Parliament must get this balance right.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ministry of Local Government, Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs has announced plans to develop a Digital Registry System to serve as a central platform for churches to update their operational status annually.</p>



<p>Ahmed Ibrahim, the sector Minister, disclosed this in Parliament on Wednesday in response to a question from Prof. Kingsley Nyarko, Member of Parliament for Kwadaso, regarding the status of registered churches in the country.</p>



<p>He explained that the Ministry would establish a data-sharing agreement with the Office of the Registrar of Companies (ORC) to access records of churches registered as companies limited by guarantee.</p>



<p>The initiative, he said, would be carried out in collaboration with the ORC and the Ministry of Justice.</p>



<p>Additionally, Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies (MMDAs) would maintain local registers of churches operating within their jurisdictions as part of the local governance structure.</p>



<p>These registers, Mr Ibrahim noted, would eventually be linked to the central digital system to ensure accurate and up-to-date information on churches nationwide.</p>



<p>Responding to questions on the number of churches in the country, Mr Ibrahim said that although the ORC did not publish a single national figure, regional data and surveys revealed thousands of churches across Ghana.</p>



<p>In the Greater Accra Region alone, more than 2,200 churches had been registered, with about 98 per cent owned by individuals.</p>



<p>He recalled that the Religious Bodies (Regulation) Law, 1989 (PNDC Law 221), was originally intended to regulate the establishment of churches and religious bodies but faced opposition from many groups who argued that it infringed on religious freedom and gave government excessive control over religious practice.</p>



<p>“Today, churches are registered as companies limited by guarantee with the Office of the Registrar of Companies. This gives them legal recognition, the ability to own property, and protection under Ghanaian law,” Mr Ibrahim said.</p>



<p>He added that the new digital registry would provide a reliable mechanism for tracking the operational status of churches, thereby enhancing transparency and governance in the religious sector.</p>

<p>The Minority in Parliament has criticised the proposed Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025, describing it as overly centralising power in the Presidency and lacking adequate safeguards.</p>



<p>In a press statement issued on Wednesday, February 18, the Minority Leader, Alexander Afenyo-Markin, said that although the Minority supports reforms to Ghana’s national security architecture, the current draft of the Bill is “deeply flawed”.</p>



<p>“Let me be clear. The Minority Caucus supports the need to reform Ghana’s national security architecture. Our country requires a modern, efficient and professional intelligence system that protects citizens and safeguards our constitutional order,” he stated.</p>



<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dDWlwZ9M3qR4UMVPNZYM-mMEn3-k2udK/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>



<p>However, he warned that the Bill concentrates excessive appointing authority in the hands of the President, including the power to appoint the National Security Coordinator and Directors-General of intelligence agencies without parliamentary vetting.</p>



<p>“These offices control agencies with coercive powers and access to sensitive national data. It is unacceptable that they operate without legislative scrutiny,” he argued.</p>



<p>Mr Afenyo-Markin further raised concerns about what he described as weak oversight mechanisms dominated by the Executive.</p>



<p>According to him, the National Security Council, chaired by the President, effectively becomes the governing body of the intelligence agencies, amounting to “self-oversight.”</p>



<p>He also criticised the absence of an independent inspector-style body with proactive investigative powers.</p>



<p>“For these reasons, we cannot support the Bill in its present form,” he declared, urging Parliament to insert independent oversight mechanisms to ensure that national security operations remain accountable and constitutionally grounded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University, Prof. William Kwasi Peprah, says the Bank of Ghana is set to exit financing for the gold trade, a development he believes will increase pressure on the operational and funding model of the proposed Gold Board.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, Prof Peprah described the Gold Board concept as “very good,” but cautioned that the financing structure must be tightened quickly to prevent the new arrangement from sliding into the kind of challenges currently associated with COCOBOD.</p>



<p>“The financing model for Gold Board also needs to be looked at a little bit,” he said, warning that the institution has already faced difficulties accessing promised government funding.</p>



<p>He noted that the Gold Board has relied on support from the Government of Ghana, but “the amount they promised were not fully released in 2025,” and with “Bank of Ghana… going to exit in financing gold trade,” the new structure will have to find alternative ways to stay afloat.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said the law establishing the Gold Board provides an option that should now be explored more seriously. “In the law, it allows them to take money in advance from whoever needs gold, and then be able to give them the gold,” he explained, adding that the model must be examined carefully to ensure sustainability.</p>



<p>He also advocated for Ghana to establish a gold stabilisation account, similar to those already in place for cocoa and petroleum. </p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSCZdNE0E_o?si=adO3gewCnJNKrb8T" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“If the Gold Board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold,” he stressed.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said Ghana must not treat the current rise in gold prices as permanent. </p>



<p>He explained that gold is largely driven by three factors: fear, inflation, and currency hedging. He pointed to growing global uncertainty as a major reason prices have surged.</p>



<p>“We currently have fear… so many things happening in the world, which makes investors uncertain. So that is why we are seeing the gold price really, really moving up,” he said.</p>



<p>He added that while inflation projections from the IMF and the World Bank are expected to moderate, the weakening of the US dollar has also prompted investors to turn to gold. “We’ve noticed that the US dollar is devaluing, and that’s why we see investors moving into gold,” he noted.</p>



<p>With Ghana benefiting from what he described as a “windfall,” Prof Peprah urged authorities to prepare for the possibility of falling prices.</p>



<p>“Now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold… to guard against initial [shocks] that will come in,” he said.</p>



<p>He warned that without a stabilisation buffer, Ghana could face serious trouble if gold prices decline. “If the price starts to drop, it’s not really going to affect the economy,” he said, explaining that the stabilisation fund would protect the industry and provide support when needed.</p>



<p>He also drew a clear distinction between a revolving fund and a stabilisation fund. “They have a revolving fund. Revolving fund account is not the same as stabilisation fund account,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah concluded that Ghana must build a long-term safety net around gold revenues, warning that if the country fails to plan properly, “our trade balance will move into a very struggling position.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ghana Accountability Forum (GAF) called for a forensic audit into the finances of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), as the nation’s cocoa sector undergoes structural reforms.</p>



<p>In that regard, the forum called on the government to set up an independent committee that would publish its findings to strengthen public sector transparency and accountability.</p>



<p>The GAF is a non-partisan platform that brings together civil society organizations (CSOs), anti-corruption advocates, media practitioners, youth activists, and concerned citizens to collectively demand accountability in public life.</p>



<p>It serves as a safe and credible space for dialogue, advocacy, research, and citizen engagement focusing on anti-corruption advocacy, public financial accountability, social accountability, access to information, media freedom, and whistleblower protection.</p>



<p>A statement issued and signed by Mr Raphael Godlove Ahenu, the Interim Chairman of the GAF said parliamentary oversight over the management of the COCOBOD ought to be strengthened too.</p>



<p>“In fact, accountability should not be politicized but rather seen as a national responsibility to safeguard Ghana’s most iconic agricultural sector,” a copy of the statement made available to the Ghana News Agency (GNA) stated.</p>



<p>It observed that a comprehensive investigation into the operations of the COCOBOD was required to hold authorities accountable, as the nation reformed her cocoa sector.</p>



<p>The statement indicated that: “The scale of financial strain, declining cocoa output, and growing concerns among farmers demand urgent scrutiny of management decisions, financial commitments, and governance practices within COCOBOD”.</p>



<p>It said “The current situation within the cocoa sector raises serious questions about oversight, accountability, and long-term sustainability.</p>



<p>A thorough investigation is necessary to establish the facts and protect the national interest”, saying that: “Reports suggest that the COCOBOD’s debt burden has increased significantly”.</p>



<p>It said the sharp decline in the nation’s annual cocoa production could have far-reaching consequences on rural livelihoods and the broader economy, citing factors like illegal mining, ageing cocoa farms, plant diseases, and inadequate support systems for farmers as major contributors.</p>



<p>The statement added that: “Cocoa is central to Ghana’s economy and identity and that calls for courage, transparency, and reforms, placing accountability at the heart of the sector governance structure.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Africa’s Global Bank, United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc, has unveiled a diaspora banking and investment platform designed to serve Africans living and working across the world and within the continent.</p>



<p>The platform, launched in collaboration with leading ecosystem partners including United Capital, Africa Prudential, UBA Pensions, Afriland Properties, Heirs Insurance Group, and Avon Healthcare Limited, represents a major step in redefining diaspora banking beyond remittances toward structured wealth creation and long-term investment.</p>



<p>At the unveiling, which took place at UBA’s global headquarters in Lagos under the theme: “Beyond Banking: Powering the Global African Lifestyle, all the company representatives were on hand to showcase a seamless platform that goes beyond remittances, wealth creation, protection, and long-term prosperity.</p>



<p>Speaking at the event, UBA’s Head of Diaspora Banking, Anant Rao, described the initiative as a strategic shift in how Africa engages its global citizens.</p>



<p>“For decades, Africa’s engagement with its diaspora has focused largely on remittances. Today, we are moving beyond that. This platform represents a transition from simple money transfers to a financial ecosystem where Africans globally can bank, make payments, invest, protect their families, and build long-term wealth seamlessly,” he said.</p>

<p>Rao noted that African diaspora remittance flows exceed $100 billion annually, making them one of the most resilient and consistent sources of capital into the continent.</p>



<p>“Diaspora capital is not just a flow of funds — it is a strategic growth partner for Africa.<br>Our role is to provide a trusted platform that converts capital into structured investment and shared prosperity across the continent.”</p>



<p>The objective is to provide a platform that brings together offerings to address the diverse needs of the Global African, including Banking and payments, Investments, securities services, asset management, Insurance, Pensions, and real estate.</p>



<p>Through this coordinated ecosystem, diaspora customers can access financial solutions across multiple sectors through a single trusted platform, enabling them to manage their financial lives and family commitments across borders with ease and transparency.</p>



<p>UBA’s Group Head, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Alero Ladipo, emphasised the importance of collaboration in delivering a seamless diaspora experience.</p>



<p>“The modern African is a global citizen — mobile, ambitious, and deeply connected to home. Whether living in Africa, Europe, the Americas, or the Middle East, there must be a structured and secure financial connection to your home country. </p>



<p>&#8220;This platform ensures that Africans everywhere can remain economically connected to the continent with confidence and transparency.”</p>



<p>Partners within the ecosystem highlighted growing demand among diaspora Africans for structured investment opportunities, secure property ownership, insurance protection, and long-term financial planning.</p>



<p>United Capital showcased globally accessible investment products designed to deliver professionally managed, transparent wealth-creation opportunities.</p>



<p>Afriland Properties emphasised structured and well-governed real estate investment pathways for diaspora clients.</p>



<p>Heirs Insurance highlighted protection solutions for life and assets, while Avon Healthcare Limited demonstrated healthcare access and cross-border insurance solutions for families.</p>

<p>Rao also reiterated the guiding philosophy of Africapitalism, championed by UBA’s Founder and Chairman, Tony O. Elumelu, CFR.</p>



<p>He explained that Africapitalism is the belief that Africa’s private sector must play a leading role in the continent’s development by making long-term investments that generate both economic returns and social impact.</p>



<p>As Africa continues to position itself as one of the world’s most dynamic growth frontiers, UBA believes mobilising diaspora capital through trusted financial institutions will be central to shaping the continent’s next phase of development.</p>



<p>“Africa will increasingly be financed by Africans themselves, including Africans abroad,” Rao added.<br>“Our responsibility is to build the trusted financial infrastructure that makes this possible.”</p>



<p>“When Africa’s global citizens invest back into Africa, growth becomes inevitable,” he concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last week, eight Ghanaian traders were gruesomely killed and several others wounded when insurgents ambushed a community in Burkina Faso where they had travelled to buy tomatoes and other foodstuffs.</p>



<p>Ghana and Burkina Faso share a border and those of us from the Upper East know how closely knitted the border communities are. Citizens of both countries cross over on a daily basis for both business and family issues.</p>



<p>The traders’ trip there last week was, therefore, one of a routine governed by the decades-old trade relations between two African neighbours. In this case, it was simply to cross the border, access produce that Ghana does not currently have and return to sustain their livelihoods and feed the market back home.</p>



<p>But as fate would have it, that journey ended in blood, depriving families of loved ones and breadwinners. Indeed, similar journeys have resulted in deaths, but mostly from road crashes.</p>



<p>Rather than limit it to the typical Sahelian insurgency that it has always been, we must see this incident as a mirror held up to us, Ghanaians. When properly examined, the incident reveals the deeper consequences of our failure to deliver on the very policies that were supposed to make such journeys unnecessary.</p>



<p>While we do not know the details, the media reports from government officials showed that our compatriots, the food traders, risked their lives in conflict zones to cart foodstuffs, including tomatoes, which the nation lacks now.</p>



<p>This begs the question: what has become of the myriads of agricultural promises and investments that were announced and implemented in recent years?</p>



<p><strong>Human cost of failed agric policies</strong></p>



<p>Every November, Ghana’s dry season arrives with its annual certainty, starting with extreme cold and dryness before graduating to unbearable heat and dust. But unlike other countries that plan for such predictable cycles, we enter this period with agricultural scarcity that forces traders to look beyond our borders. It has been so since I was a child, growing up in the dusty footpaths of Bongo in the Upper East Region.</p>



<p>And while that happened, Ghana implemented a series of agricultural policies, which we proudly announced, funded, launched with fanfare but later abandoned.</p>



<p>Now, as we mourn our mothers, sisters and loved ones, it refreshes the painful question: What became of the many laudable initiatives designed to guarantee food security, especially in the dry season?</p>



<p>This brings back memories of the famous One Village, One Dam and the Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) policies and the nearly $1 billion Pwalugu Multipurpose Dam project that were once touted as game changers only to fizzle out, leaving behind scars of debts for the country.</p>



<p>In the case of the One Village, One Dam, it was touted as the solution to northern Ghana’s water and irrigation challenges. For those aware of the agricultural potential of the north, this sounded like the final solution but as is now common knowledge, the policy produced many dams that turned out to be dugouts, incapable of supporting even backyard farming during the harsh perennial harmattan.</p>



<p>Multiple media reports showed that in many communities, the dams dried up before the dry season even peaked.</p>



<p>Billions of cedis were also pumped into PFJ across the two phases, yet the structure of the programme, which was heavy on subsidies but weak on irrigation, mechanisation and market linkages, meant that the country remains vulnerable to seasonal shortages. Reported bumper harvests in plantain and other produce were not sustained, pushing us back on the cycle of scarcity.</p>



<p>Today, despite PFJ’s massive expenditure, Ghana cannot produce tomatoes consistently year-round, resulting in our traders continuing the perilous journey to Burkina Faso, leading to the deadly ambush.</p>



<p>Then comes the Pwalugu Dam. It was branded as the “game changer” and envisioned to provide irrigation for thousands of hectares, stabilise northern sector’s power supply, and unlock agro-industrial potential.</p>



<p>Years later, the site remains untouched by meaningful progress. There is no reservoir, no turbines, no irrigation canals and so no impact yet a huge debt has been incurred and borne by Mother Ghana.</p>



<p>Beyond these, numerous pilot projects, demonstration farms, mechanisation centres and irrigation schemes consumed resources and headlines but delivered little in sustained agricultural transformation, confirming our challenges with execution.</p>



<p>The painful truth</p>



<p>Analysing these lead to one painful conclusion – if these policies were properly executed to success, these perilous journeys would have been needless and our mothers might have just been saved.</p>



<p>If One Village, One Dam had delivered functional irrigation, farmers in Northern Ghana could be producing tomatoes now. If PFJ had strengthened irrigation and agro-processing value chains instead of focusing narrowly on input distribution, we could have a stable year-round supply. If the Pwalugu Dam existed today, Ghana would be exporting vegetables, not importing from conflict zones.</p>



<p>Indeed, our traders were in Burkina Faso because domestic systems failed their customers and they had to go through conflict zones in search of foodstuffs.</p>



<p>This is why we must now embrace this painful moment as a rallying point to not repeat our mistakes. Ghana doesn’t need dugouts nor rhetoric.</p>



<p>The country’s farmers need professionally engineered, climate resilient irrigation systems capable of supporting commercial agriculture.</p>



<p>The Pwalugu Dam cannot be left as a phantom project. Every abandoned or underperforming agricultural initiative must be audited, explained, and either revived or reprogrammed.</p>



<p>Food security is a national priority. When people must travel to conflict zones for tomatoes, it raises genuine questions about the state of the country’s food supply, and national security must be involved.</p>



<p>I am particularly happy that the matter has gotten the attention of President John Mahama and I am hopeful that he will ride on it to execute impactful policies.</p>



<p>There is no belabouring the point that the future lies in empowering commercial farmers, of which the president is one. Agri-processors, and investors need support, not solely from government-run programmes but also the private-sector and development institutions, including the World Bank and the African Development Bank.</p>



<p>We must create the environment for sustainable private-sector driven irrigation, mechanisation, and value chain growth.</p>



<p>Thus, while we mourn the deceased, I am hopeful that we will honour them by refusing to repeat the cycle of policies without implementation, by demanding seriousness in agricultural planning, by insisting that food security is a national non-negotiable.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Ghana has the capacity, the land, the people, and the ideas. And we have a President who has shown that he can mobilise the country’s resources to achieve the best for its today and tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Johnson Asiedu Nketia, the National Chairman of the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) has reiterated calls on supporters of the party to unite and embrace peace to help retain the party in government.</p>



<p>The National Chairman said unity was a process that required collective efforts to consolidate the grassroots and pave the way for continued good governance, enabling Ghanaians to enjoy better lives.</p>



<p>Mr Asiedu Nketia made the call when he addressed supporters of the party in Agona West and East as part of his ‘thank you’ tour at Agona Swedru.</p>



<p>The National Chairman was accompanied by Ekow Okyere Panyin Aduamoah, the Central Regional Minister; Richard Asiedu, the Central Regional Chairman of the party; MMDCEs; and other top officials of the NDC.</p>



<p>He said the tour of the Central region was a campaign promise given to the chiefs, the clergy, opinion leaders, floating voters and many others during the 2024 Presidential and Parliamentary elections.</p>



<p>Mr Asiedu Nketia further admonished the party&#8217;s supporters not to take the electoral victory lightly, particularly in Agona West, where for many years the NDC had not won such a massive vote, adding that the opponent was also seriously adopting strategies to reorganise itself to come out strongly in 2028.</p>



<p>He said Ghanaians were witnessing good governance under President Mahama, and that his promise to appoint only 60 Ministers if he won the elections had been fulfilled to avoid draining the economy, unlike the New Patriotic Party, which appointed 125 ministers.</p>



<p>Mr Asiedu Nketia urged party members seeking jobs to exercise restraint, noting that not all four million NDC members could be appointed as Ministers.</p>



<p>He expressed gratitude to the chiefs, the Queen mothers, and all for their support and prayers, which helped the NDC win the elections, and pledged to reconstruct roads in the Agona Swedru enclave to facilitate the free movement of goods and services.</p>



<p>Mr Eric Gyamfi Odoom, the Agona West Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), said President Mahama’s reset agenda had reflected in the lives of the people in the Municipality in the areas of education, health, potable water, job creation and reshaping of feeder roads to improve the quality of life of the people.</p>



<p>He said it was unprecedented that 10 million Ghana cedis was received from the government under the District Assembly Common Fund as part of President Mahama’s reset agenda.</p>



<p>He said the substantial amount released by the Common Fund administrator had enabled the Assembly to undertake many development projects, including school blocks, health facilities, and potable water.</p>



<p>Nana Kweku Esieni V, the Regent of Agona Swedru, appealed to the National Chairman to use his good offices to help with the construction of the Swedru/Winneba-Junction Road, the Swedru /Akim Oda Road, and the Swedru/Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam District Road to improve the transportation of goods and services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Government’s skills development and training programme is to create sustainable employment opportunities and improve the incomes of young people, especially women and vulnerable groups.</p>



<p>Alhaji Mohammed Muntaka Mubarak, Minister for the Interior, who said this, explained that equipping young people with the requisite employability skills and mindset was the surest way to reduce the country’s unemployment.</p>



<p>Alhaji Muntaka Mubarak, who is also the Member of Parliament (MP) for Asawase, was speaking at the graduation ceremony and the distribution of startup kits to 242 young people trained under the National Apprenticeship Programme in Asawase, Asokore-Mampong Municipality.</p>



<p>The training programme is a collaboration between the Ghana Enterprises Agency and the Mastercard Foundation.</p>



<p>They were trained in fruit juice processing, catfish aquaculture, and livestock production. ‎</p>



<p>Muntaka Mubarak noted that the initiative, rooted in the NDC&#8217;s 2024 manifesto, aimed to combat youth unemployment by promoting vocational skills.‎</p>



<p>It also strives to ensure that young men and women, including individuals with disabilities, receive certification, startup support, and pathways to self-employment.‎</p>



<p>According to the MP, the overarching goal was to provide employment and income opportunities for 250,000 youth aged 15-35 nationwide, with 70% women and 10% persons with disabilities.‎</p>



<p>He underscored that, the government was committed to creating diverse opportunities that alleviated poverty, enhance food security, and stimulate local industries.‎</p>



<p>Alhaji Muntaka noted that the government was prepared to monitor progress, tackle challenges, and amplify successes to ensure that every corner of Ghana, including the Asawase constituency, benefited from these initiatives.‎</p>



<p>He explained that the programme was revolutionary in its inclusivity and practicality, partnering with master craftsmen to facilitate training in authentic workshops and on genuine projects.</p>



<p>Apprentices, he said, not only acquired technical skills but also participated in entrepreneurship modules and business management training, and received certification recognised by national authorities.</p>



<p>He noted that quotas had been established to ensure meaningful participation by women, who often face additional barriers, and that provisions had been made to support them.‎</p>



<p>The NDC government was also exploring synergies with other programs, such as Adwumawura and skills partnerships with institutions like the Ghana National Fire Service, to expand opportunities, he stated.‎</p>



<p>Muntaka Mubarak appealed to traditional leaders, the Council of Ulamas, the Christian Council, and the Sarkin Zongo to continue providing guidance and moral support to young entrepreneurs.</p>



<p>“Let this ceremony inspire us all to strive harder, support one another, and construct the prosperous Ghana we all deserve, one skilled youth, one thriving business, one empowered community at a time,” he stated.‎</p>



<p>He also urged the youth not to let doubt or adversity deter them, asserting that with determination, government support, and the blessings of Almighty Allah, they would undoubtedly succeed.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Plan International Ghana has urged journalists to move beyond sensational headlines and political propaganda and embrace responsible, rights-based reporting on children, girls and vulnerable communities.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Plan International Ghana has urged journalists to move beyond sensational headlines and political propaganda and embrace responsible, rights-based reporting on children, girls and vulnerable communities.</p>



<p>At the opening of a three-day media training on gender and children in Koforidua on Monday, Mr Eric Ayaba, the Head of Programmes and Influencing at Plan International Ghana, said although there were countless untold stories about children and girls across the country, many media practitioners often prioritised political and sensational narratives over development and rights issues.</p>



<p>It was on the theme: “Journalism with Purpose: Reporting Responsibly on Children, Gender, Equity and Vulnerable Communities,” held at the Eastern Premier Hotel in Koforidua.</p>



<p>“Telling the story of children and girls is in itself a development issue. It is also an issue of rights for people to know,” he said.</p>



<p>He expressed concern over reportage that perpetuated stereotyping and victim-blaming, particularly in cases of sexual and gender-based violence.</p>



<p>“The moment you begin to blame the victim, you are almost cutting off the most important information needed to tell the truth about the story,” Mr Ayaba stated.</p>



<p>He urged journalists to uphold the “do no harm” principle, stressing that reportage must not endanger or retraumatise children and vulnerable persons.</p>



<p>Mr Ayaba underscored the importance of informed and ongoing consent, noting that consent could be withdrawn at any time. He emphasised safeguarding anonymity to protect sources from further harm.</p>



<p>“As journalists, you are the bridge between reality and public perception. The goal is not just to be better reporters, but responsible reporters,” he said, adding that professional competence must go hand in hand with ethical responsibility.</p>



<p>He noted that Plan International Ghana had, over the past three years, consistently engaged the media to build capacity in gender-transformative reporting and would continue to invest in the partnership if it yielded measurable outcomes.</p>



<p>Plan International, founded in 1937, is a global humanitarian and development organisation working to advance children’s rights and equality for girls.</p>



<p>In Ghana, the organisation implements programmes focused on education, child protection, youth empowerment, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and gender equality.</p>



<p>Its collaboration with the media forms part of a broader influencing strategy to shape public discourse and policies affecting children and marginalised groups.</p>



<p>Ms Theodora Asare, Project Manager of the Renewed Women’s Voice and Leadership (RWVL) Ghana Project, highlighted structural inequalities and limited access to resources as persistent barriers to gender equality.</p>



<p>She said the project, funded by Global Affairs Canada with support from Plan International Canada, aimed to strengthen the capacity of 120 local, regional and national women’s rights organisations, youth-led groups and human rights defenders between March 2025 and December 2031.</p>



<p>With an allocation of about 1.9 million dollars, more than half of which would go directly to grantees, the project would provide flexible funding, advocacy support and research-based interventions to drive legal and social change.</p>



<p>“We want to enhance organisational sustainability. If your organisation is not properly structured, you cannot mobilise resources to serve women and girls,” Ms Asare said.</p>



<p>The project is being implemented in partnership with the Network for Human Rights in Ghana and AfriYan Ghana to support both established and emerging organisations, particularly those representing structurally excluded groups.</p>



<p>Ms Asare noted that strengthening feminist and intersectional approaches, promoting transparency and accountability, and investing in collective care and well-being were central to the initiative.</p>



<p>She emphasised the media’s role in amplifying research findings and policy advocacy efforts, stating that evidence-based reporting was critical to advancing gender equality and influencing reforms.</p>



<p>Ms Regina Asamoah, an award-winning journalist and communications specialist, highlighted practical safeguarding measures, including disabling geolocation features on mobile devices when covering sensitive stories in communities.</p>



<p>She advised journalists to obtain consent before taking photographs or videos and to use inclusive language, replacing terms such as “beneficiaries” with “participants” to avoid reinforcing top-down narratives.</p>



<p>Ms Asamoah also outlined several ongoing initiatives under Plan International Ghana, including education, digital skills, youth empowerment and humanitarian interventions, urging journalists to explore development-focused angles in their coverage.</p>



<p>The training forms part of Plan International Ghana’s broader commitment to promoting ethical journalism that prioritising dignity over headlines, safety over hate and development over propaganda.</p>



<p>Participants are expected to leave the workshop with strengthened skills in gender-transformative reporting, safeguarding and rights-based storytelling to ensure media coverage contributed positively to national development and the protection of children and vulnerable populations.</p>

<p>The Minister of Roads and Highways, Governs Kwame Agbodza, has attributed the current financial challenges facing the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) to the awarding of cocoa road contracts valued at GH¢23 billion during the 2023/2024 fiscal year.</p>



<p>He explained that the sheer magnitude of the contracts compelled COCOBOD to channel significant funds into procuring construction materials, which adversely affected the institution’s financial standing.</p>



<p>Mr. Agbodza made the remarks in Parliament on Wednesday while responding to questions on the government’s value-for-money analysis and the status of the cocoa roads programme.</p>



<p>The Minister noted that the suspension of cocoa road projects in 2017 had adversely affected cocoa-growing communities, resulting in deteriorating road networks, halted contracts, disruptions to the cocoa value chain, and hardships for farmers.</p>



<p>“In view of these challenges, the government has ceded all cocoa road projects to the Ministry of Roads and Highways, particularly the Urban and Feeder Roads Departments,” he stated.</p>



<p>There were 266 cocoa road contracts awarded, stressing the need for a comprehensive review of the programme to ensure efficiency and sustainability, Mr Agbodza stated.</p>

<p>Johnson Asiedu Nketia, Chairman of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), has urged cocoa farmers in Ghana to hold the previous government accountable for the ongoing cocoa crisis, which has led to falling cocoa prices.</p>



<p>President John Mahama, he noted, had established a committee to investigate issues in the cocoa sector, promising that Ghanaians would soon see the consequences of the previous administration’s decisions.</p>



<p>Mr Asiedu Nketia made the call during a thank-you tour in the Twifo Atti-Morkwa of the Central Region.</p>



<p>He urged farmers to remain patient, noting that the current NDC government has prudent policies for them.</p>



<p>Central Regional NDC Chairman, Mr Richard Kofi Asiedu, encouraged the people to continue supporting the NDC in the next election.</p>



<p>The two visited various constituencies in the region to express gratitude for their strong voter turnout in the 2024 general elections.</p>



<p>The District Chief Executive for Twifo-Atti-Mokwa, Isaac Yawson, said the government would not overlook development in the Central Region, noting the imminent completion of two legacy projects, including a school building and market stores initiated by the previous administration in the area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Work on the expansion and rehabilitation of the runway at the Kotoka International Airport (KIA) is progressing steadily, with authorities confident the project will significantly enhance Ghana’s aviation capacity, safety standards and long-term competitiveness.</p>



<p>The ongoing works, which include widening the runway from 60 metres to 75 metres, resurfacing its entire length, and upgrading critical lighting systems, are designed to accommodate larger aircraft, increase passenger throughput, and meet growing domestic and international aviation demand.</p>



<p>Yvonne Nana Afriyie Opare, Managing Director of the Ghana Airports Company Limited (GACL), says the project is forward-looking and essential to ensuring that Ghana’s main international gateway remains fit for purpose over the next decade and beyond.</p>



<p>“We have a growing population and more aircraft and passengers arriving daily. Projects like this must be future-oriented, ensuring the runway remains fit for purpose 10 years from now,” she said.</p>



<p>Mrs Opare was speaking during a working visit by the GACL Board to inspect the runway expansion and other infrastructure projects, including the new head office complex, currently under construction.</p>



<p>She explained that the runway was last repaired about 30 years ago, far exceeding the standard lifespan of such works.</p>



<p>“Normally, the lifespan of every runway repair is about 15 years based on ICAO standards. Now, after 30 years, it is time for an overlay and expansion,” she explained.</p>



<p>The project includes resurfacing the entire runway, extending the shoulders by 7.5 metres on each side, and upgrading the Airfield Ground Lighting (AGL) system to enhance night-time operations and overall safety.</p>



<p>A 100-metre trial section of the runway has already been completed, with night works ongoing to minimise disruptions to flight schedules.</p>



<p>When completed, the upgraded runway will meet Category 4F standards, enabling KIA to handle large aircraft such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 787, and substantially boost the airport’s operational efficiency. The project is scheduled for completion by July 2027.</p>



<p>Mr James Agalga, Board Chairman of GACL, commended the project team for the pace and professionalism demonstrated so far, describing the progress as impressive.</p>



<p>“The works are on schedule. The speed and professionalism are commendable. From the runway to the head office building, the progress is impressive, and we look forward to the timely delivery of all commitments,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Ehud Deri, Director in charge of the project being executed by the contractor, Amandi, said about 150 workers were currently on site, supported by the consultant, Devotec.</p>



<p>He said careful coordination of manpower, procurement processes and equipment delivery was critical to meeting the project timelines.</p>



<p>“Every night’s work is carefully planned, with each task measured to ensure no mistakes. This project requires precision and rapid deployment,” Mr Deri said.</p>



<p>Alongside the runway works, construction of GACL’s new head office complex is also progressing steadily.</p>



<p>The project comprises two underground basements with 160 parking spaces and a 10-storey building above ground, designed to enhance operational efficiency and staff capacity.</p>



<p>The combined projects are expected to significantly strengthen Ghana’s aviation infrastructure, enhance the passenger experience, and position KIA as a more competitive hub for air travel in the West African subregion.</p>



<p>Other members of the Board are Attah Issah – MP for Sagnarigu Constituency, William Ntebe Ayo – MP for Tatale-Sanguli Constituency, Mark William Attipoe, Ministry of Transport, Kwabena Amponsah Dapaah – Fellow, Ghana Institution of Surveyors, Diana Amakie Ashong – Business Executive, Yvonne Nana Afriyie Opare – Managing Director, GACL, Air Commodore Elvis King Arneson Representative, Ghana Air Force andMr Joseph Enimil-Armah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Parliament is set to consider a constitutional amendment that could allow dual citizens to occupy key public offices in Ghana.</p>



<p>The Constitution of Ghana (Amendment) Bill, 2025, seeks to remove existing restrictions that bar persons with dual citizenship or allegiance to another country from holding positions such as Ambassador or High Commissioner, Secretary to the Cabinet, Chief of Defence Staff, and Inspector-General of Police.</p>



<p>The Bill, which has undergone its First Reading, was on Tuesday referred to the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee of Parliament for detailed consideration by Bernard Ahiafor, the First Deputy Speaker of Parliament.</p>



<p>Proponents argue that the amendment would enable Ghana to harness the skills and expertise of its diaspora community, thereby promoting inclusive governance and national development.</p>



<p>“This is not about questioning anyone’s loyalty. It’s about recognising the realities of the world we live in today and allowing capable Ghanaians to take up leadership roles,” Davis Ansah Opoku, New Patriotic Party Member of Parliament for Mpraeso and co-sponsor of the Bill, stated.</p>



<p>The proposed amendment has attracted support from various quarters, with advocates saying it could strengthen Ghana’s democracy and enhance representation.</p>



<p>However, some critics have raised concerns about national security and the risk of divided loyalties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nana Oye Bampoe-Addo, Deputy Chief of Staff, has described the ‘reset agenda’ as more than a political slogan, but a deliberate call to rebuild trust in governance, reform institutions, and reset the place of women in Leadership.</p>



<p>She emphasised that the reset agenda was inherently a ‘gender agenda’ and reflected President John Dramani Mahama’s firm confidence in women&#8217;s capacity to lead.</p>



<p>“The reset agenda is a gender agenda, and President Mahama has clearly demonstrated utmost confidence in the women’s leadership agenda.”</p>



<p>Nana Oye Bampoe-Addo made the remarks at the 2nd Annual Conference for Women in Leadership in the Public Sector under the auspices of the Public Services Commission on the theme: “Breaking Barriers, Building Impact: Advancing Women’s Leadership in the Resetting Ghana Agenda”.</p>



<p>She called for critical reflection on progress in breaking barriers and building impact for women, particularly within the public sector, which was the centre of governance.</p>



<p>Data from the Public Services Commission show that women currently occupy 26 per cent of managerial positions in the public sector.</p>



<p>Although the judiciary has had three consecutive female Chief Justices, there are currently four women among 19 Justices at the Supreme Court, representing approximately 21 per cent.</p>



<p>She indicated that women accounted for 23.21 per cent of political appointments, and that government was working towards meeting the statutory thresholds under the Affirmative Action Gender Equity Act, which stipulate 30 per cent female representation by 2026, 35 per cent by 2028, and 50 per cent by 2030.</p>



<p>“These targets are not merely symbolic; they are a national obligation,” she emphasised.</p>



<p>She mentioned the appointments of Madam Daniella Mawusi Ntow Sarpong as the first female Chief Fire Officer, Madam Patience Baffoe-Bonnie as head of the Ghana Prisons Service, Professor Naana Jane Opoku-Agyeman’s nomination as the first female Vice President and others as clear evidence that the Reset Agenda was producing measurable change rather than symbolic commitments.</p>



<p>The Deputy Chief of Staff and a human rights lawyer urged women to embrace personal leadership, stressing that leadership was defined not by title but by impact and service.</p>



<p>She also encouraged transformational leadership, calling on women to inspire institutions and build legacies that would outlive their tenure.</p>



<p>The Women in Leadership Conference is part of the PSC&#8217;s commitment to promoting excellence in governance and advancing gender mainstreaming in the public sector.</p>



<p>Participants were drawn from women in positions such as Chief Directors, Chief Executive Officers, directors, managers, and analogous grades in the public sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Vice President Professor Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, on Wednesday, urged public service agencies to ensure that recruitment, promotions, and appointments to positions are gender-responsive, transparent, and merit-based.</p>



<p>This may be accomplished by cultivating organisational cultures that prioritise merits, fairness, and inclusivity over tokenism and flexible working arrangements.</p>



<p>The Vice President, speaking at the opening of the second annual conference for Women in Leadership in the public sector in Accra, noted that the government was committed to implementing the Affirmative Action and Gender Equity law.</p>



<p>In line with that, the government has expanded the National Archives Insurance School to be more inclusive and financially sustainable, and has launched other economic empowerment initiatives, such as the Women’s Economic Resilience Initiative.</p>



<p>We have also launched other initiatives to broaden women’s access to capital, digital finance tools, and markets, while increasing women’s inclusion in strategic sectors and value chains.</p>



<p>According to the Vice President, these were deliberate policy measures and concrete steps toward a Ghana where women had fairer access to opportunities and could overcome barriers to their advancement and growth.</p>



<p>Prof. Opoku-Agyemang challenged female public service officers not to yield to biases and stereotypes, adding, “act with boldness, act with clarity, act with purpose.”</p>



<p>“To my fellow females, as I said, don’t be intimidated, it is not about making yourself in other people’s image. It is not about your hairline. It is not about your eyebrow It is not about the hair you do not like. It is about impact; it is about staying true to the values.”</p>



<p>The day’s conference is themed “Breaking Barriers, Building Impact: Advancing Women’s Leadership in the Resetting Ghana Agenda.”</p>



<p>As part of its commitment to promoting excellence in governance and advancing Gender mainstreaming in the Public Sector, the Public Services Commission is organising the Women in Leadership conference.</p>



<p>The Conference is designed to empower women holding Leadership positions, such as Chief Directors, Chief Executive Officers, Directors, managers, and analogous grades, in the public sector.</p>



<p>The Conference, among other things, sought to further enhance women leaders&#8217; capabilities and position the sector to lead in implementing the Affirmative Action and Gender Equity law.</p>



<p>Madam Lydia Lamisi Akanvariba, Minister of State in charge of Public Sector reforms, said comprehensive reforms to achieve Gender balance in staffing and leadership in the Public sector were ready to be rolled out.</p>



<p>She said the designation of Gender Desk Officers across all government institutions, agencies, and departments was a deliberate step to lead gender mainstreaming initiatives.</p>



<p>Earlier, Ms Nana Oye Bampoe-Addo, Deputy Chief of Staff, said the government was steadily moving towards achieving the targets of the Affirmative Action and Gender Equity law, and President Mahama had clearly demonstrated utmost confidence towards women’s leadership.</p>



<p>She urged women not to let stereotypes and discrimination silence them in their pursuit of leadership roles, noting that the law protects them.</p>



<p>“The law protects you to lead, stand firmly on it and work diligently”, she emphasised.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s foreign minister has said his government has stopped a study funded by the Trump administration aiming to evaluate side effects of the life-saving hepatitis B vaccine, including any links to autism.</p>



<p>The West African country, one of the region&#8217;s poorest, has high rates of hepatitis B, and the prospective study had drawn an outcry from scientists and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-funded-guinea-bissau-vaccine-study-undergo-ethical-review-africa-cdc-official-2026-01-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international health bodies</a> because only half the newborns in the trial would get the vaccine at birth. World Health Organisation Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said it was not ethical.</p>



<p>Guinea-Bissau suspended the trial last month pending an ethical review. Critics had said it was being used to test theories linking vaccines to autism, long promoted by the U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. contradicts this, yet the scientific evidence supports it.</p>



<p>Foreign Minister Joao Bernardo Vieira said in an interview on Tuesday that the study had been closed, citing concerns raised by the scientific community and U.S. senators.</p>



<p>“It’s not going to happen, period,” he said.</p>



<p>The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention had approved a $1.6 million grant to fund the study after Kennedy scrapped the agency&#8217;s recommendation to give the vaccine to all infants at birth in the U.S.</p>



<p>The American Johns Hopkins University says that about 90% of babies exposed to hepatitis B at birth or in their first year of life develop a chronic infection, and 15% to 25% of these die early of related liver failure or cancer as a result.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">DANISH RESEARCHERS DEFEND U.S.-FUNDED HEPATITIS B TRIAL</h2>



<p>The study by researchers at the Guinea-Bissau-based Bandim Health Project, run by the University of Southern Denmark, aimed to enrol 14,000 newborns, specifically to investigate potential &#8220;non-specific effects&#8221; including skin and neuro-developmental disorders, including autism.</p>



<p>They note that Guinea-Bissau currently offers the vaccine only at six weeks of age, by which time many infants whose mothers have hepatitis B are already infected. It plans to introduce the dose at birth only in 2028.</p>



<p>Under the trial, half the infants would receive it at birth, the remainder at six weeks, as now.</p>



<p>Frederik Schaltz-Buchholzer, the lead investigator, said the discussion had shifted from healthy scientific debate to politics.</p>



<p>“Everyone will lose if this trial is halted, but especially confidence in vaccines and health research will suffer greatly,” he said.</p>



<p>He said the group still hoped that a new trial proposal might be accepted in future.</p>



<p>The Bandim project has operated in Guinea-Bissau for decades, and the researchers say their work aims to better understand the full impact of vaccines, both positive and negative.</p>



<p>Kennedy cited Bandim&#8217;s research to justify cutting U.S. funding to Gavi, a group that helps buy vaccines for the world&#8217;s poorest countries.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the U.S. CDC did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has signed an order directing that all oil and gas revenues owed to the government be paid directly into the federation account, as part of sweeping reforms aimed at boosting public finances, the presidency said on Wednesday.</p>



<p>Under the law, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation keeps 30% of oil and gas profits for frontier exploration in inland basins. </p>



<p>The presidency said those funds will now be paid into the federation account and appropriated by the government.</p>



<p>NNPC also retains 30% of oil and gas sales as operational costs and receives 30% of proceeds from Production Sharing Contracts. </p>



<p>Under the new directive, all revenues from these arrangements will flow directly into the federation account, while the company will instead receive the appropriated management fees.</p>



<p>Royalty payments, petroleum profit taxes and other statutory revenues previously collected and retained by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) will also be paid directly into the Federation Account. </p>



<p>The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) will also remit its revenues in full, with the cost of collection funded through appropriation.</p>



<p>Tinubu’s office said deductions permitted by law had sharply reduced net oil inflows and contributed to fiscal strain across federal, state, and local governments. The president also ordered a review of the law and established an implementation committee to enforce the changes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Residents of Sumbrungu in the Bolgatanga Municipality have protested on the Bolgatanga–Navrongo Highway, demanding the immediate construction of speed ramps to control the speed of vehicles plying the road.</p>



<p>The residents, comprising mostly youth, created barricades to prevent vehicles from passing, to press home their demands after several appeals to the authorities over the years fell on deaf ears.</p>



<p>According to the residents, many people have lost their lives through road crashes and pedestrians knocked down by over-speeding vehicles.</p>



<p>In 2026 alone, four accidents have been recorded on the stretch, with the latest tragic incident occurring on February 15, 2026, when a staff member of Bolgatanga Technical University, his visibly pregnant wife, and their daughter were killed by an over-speeding vehicle.</p>



<p>The Sumbrungu community lies along the main Bolgatanga–Navrongo highway but does not have a single speed ramp, creating an avenue for vehicles to overspeed and cause accidents.</p>



<p>Apart from having one of the largest markets in the Bolgatanga Municipality, which attracts traders from within the municipality and neighbouring districts, the university is also located in the community, making the area consistently busy.</p>



<p>Mr Albert Adongo, President of the Sumbrungu Youth and Development Association, lamented the longstanding neglect of their appeals for road safety interventions, including the construction of speed ramps, and said the protest would continue until their demands were met.</p>



<p>He revealed that over the years, past Assembly Members had written several letters to the Ministry of Roads and Highways and other relevant authorities requesting the construction of speed ramps on the stretch, but all efforts had proved futile.</p>



<p>He accused successive governments of neglect, stressing that the Sumbrungu stretch was the only section of the entire Bolgatanga–Navrongo highway without a single speed ramp, while other towns along the road had them.</p>



<p>He emphasised that the community had suffered enough fatalities and injuries from repeated accidents and could no longer remain silent.</p>



<p>He warned that if authorities failed to act urgently, residents would continue their protests and might be compelled to construct their own speed ramps to protect lives.</p>



<p>Mr Donatus Atanga Akamugri, the Upper East Regional Minister, upon hearing of the protest, visited the community and empathised with the residents.</p>



<p>He acknowledged that their concerns had previously been brought to his office.</p>



<p>Mr Akamugri added that was engaging the Ministry of Roads and Highways to address the situation.</p>



<p>Mr Emmanuel Antwi, the Upper East Regional Director of Roads and Highways, who accompanied the Regional Minister, assured residents that concrete steps were being taken to resolve the issue.</p>



<p>He announced that by Friday, the Safety Zonal Officer would visit the area to assess and zone the road for the construction of speed ramps, after which the necessary road safety structures would be installed in due course.</p>



<p>Following the assurances, the aggrieved demonstrators expressed mixed feelings but agreed to reopen the blocked road.</p>



<p>Traffic flow, which had been heavily affected for hours, gradually returned to normal as vehicles began to move smoothly once again.</p>



<p>Residents, however, maintained that they would closely monitor the situation and expect authorities to fulfil their promises to prevent future tragedies in the area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Prof. Willian Kwasi Peprah, Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University in the US, says Ghana’s Gold Board is a good policy idea, but its biggest risk is not gold supply or prices — it is how the scheme will be financed.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, he said the Gold Board law appears solid, but the real test will be in how it is operationalised and funded.</p>



<p>“So the gold board idea is very good,” he said. “The law is good; the operationalisation is where we must watch it carefully.”</p>



<p>He warned that, without a robust financing structure, the Gold Board could become a future burden, similar to other commodity institutions.</p>



<p>“The financing model for the gold board also needs to be looked at a little bit,” he said. “So that gold board does not tend to the next Coco board, as we are discussing.”</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah explained that gold trading is driven by global forces and that Ghana must prepare for price swings, even if prices are currently rising.</p>



<p>“To understand gold trading, gold is treated on three main angles. One, when there is fear inflation, and then a currency hedge,” he said.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSCZdNE0E_o?si=adO3gewCnJNKrb8T" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>He noted that global uncertainty is driving investors toward gold, thereby contributing to the current price strength.</p>



<p>“We currently have fear so many things happening in the world, which makes investors uncertain. So that is why we are seeing the gold price really, really moving up,” he said.</p>



<p>He also pointed to currency trends, arguing that investors are shifting into gold as the US dollar weakens.</p>



<p>“We’ve noticed that the US dollar is devaluing, and that’s why we see investors moving into gold,” he said.</p>



<p>However, Prof. Peprah cautioned that Ghana must not treat the current high prices as permanent.</p>



<p>“If the price we all know it will still start to come down,” he said.</p>



<p>He proposed that Ghana establish a gold commodity stabilisation account, similar to those already in place for cocoa and petroleum.</p>



<p>“If the gold board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>He said Ghana should take advantage of current high prices to build buffers that can protect the economy when prices fall.</p>



<p>“So now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold, to put those monies into guard against,” he explained.</p>



<p>He advised the Gold Board, the Bank of Ghana, and the government to set aside the proceeds from gold sales into a dedicated fund.</p>



<p>“My advice to the probably good ball central bank and government is that whatever amount of gold sales that is coming that we are putting in our balance of payment account, and we create that fund just for gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah stressed that the stabilisation fund is distinct from the Gold Board’s revolving fund and must not be confused with it.</p>



<p>“Gold board, they have a revolving fund. &#8221; A revolving fund account is not the same as a stabilisation fund account,” he said.</p>



<p>He added that while Ghana’s refinery plans are important for value addition, the stabilisation fund remains critical.</p>



<p>“It’s good. We are doing a refinery to add value, but that commodity fund for gold is needed,” he said.</p>



<p>Regarding financing, he noted that the Gold Board is expected to rely partly on government support, even though previous commitments were not fully honoured.</p>



<p>“It has raised, getting money from the government of Ghana, which we know the amount they promised was not fully released in 2025,” he said.</p>



<p>He also noted that the Bank of Ghana is exiting direct financing of the gold trade, thereby increasing pressure on the Gold Board to identify viable alternatives.</p>



<p>“Bank of Ghana is going to exit from financing trade,” he said.</p>



<p>He cited a provision in the law that permits advance payments by gold buyers.</p>



<p>“I think, in the law, it allows them to take money in advance from whoever needs gold, and then be able to give them the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah warned that if Ghana becomes overly dependent on gold without safeguards, the trade balance could come under strain.</p>



<p>“If we feel on gold… our trade balance will move into a very struggling position,” he cautioned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A U.S. civil rights agency has sued a bottler and distributor of Coca-Cola products, accusing it of sex discrimination over an employee networking event that excluded men, its first lawsuit over workplace diversity programs since President Donald Trump took office.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://tmsnrt.rs/4azRiSl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawsuit,</a> filed Tuesday by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleges that Coca-Cola Beverages Northeast violated federal law by hosting an event for about 250 female employees at a Connecticut casino in September 2024.</p>



<p>The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It is owned by Kirin Holdings a Japanese company. Coca-Cola is not a defendant in the case.</p>



<p>The case in New Hampshire federal court is an early test of claims by Trump administration officials, including EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, that many common workplace diversity, equity and inclusion programs amount to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trumps-anti-corporate-dei-campaign-faces-high-legal-hurdles-2025-12-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlawful reverse discrimination</a>.</p>



<p>Trump, a Republican, has moved aggressively to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-appeals-court-rejects-challenge-trumps-efforts-ban-dei-2026-02-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eradicate DEI</a>&nbsp;from the federal government, the private sector and higher education, saying it is discriminatory and erodes merit-based decision-making.</p>



<p>DEI encompasses a broad range of programs and policies that supporters say promote fair treatment and full participation for groups that have historically been underrepresented or have faced discrimination.</p>



<p>The commission is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/nike-facing-us-probe-over-alleged-discrimination-against-white-workers-2026-02-04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigating Nike</a> and Northwestern Mutual Insurance for allegedly discriminating against white workers<span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"> and, last year, demanded that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-civil-rights-agency-warns-law-firms-over-workplace-dei-policies-2025-03-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 major law firms</a> turn over information about</span> their DEI policies.</p>



<p>But the lawsuit against the Coca-Cola bottler is the EEOC&#8217;s first to allege that a diversity-focused workplace program is unlawful.</p>



<p>The EEOC&#8217;s acting general counsel, Catherine Eschbach, said that excluding a protected class of workers, such as men, from any employer-sponsored event is illegal.</p>



<p>&#8220;The EEOC remains committed to ensuring that all employees – men and women alike – enjoy equal access to all aspects of their employment,&#8221; Eschbach said in a statement.</p>



<p>The commission said in the lawsuit that the two-day networking event featured a social reception, team-building exercises, recreational activities and speakers, including a top executive at Coca-Cola.</p>



<p>Coca-Cola Beverages Northeast excused female employees who attended the event from their normal work duties without requiring them to use paid time off, and covered all of their hotel room charges, according to the lawsuit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A German appeals court has ordered the social media platform X to provide vetted researchers with access to publicly available data linked to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarian-president-sets-april-12-date-parliamentary-election-2026-01-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hungary&#8217;s April 12 election</a>, setting a precedent for enforcing EU digital transparency rules ahead of a contentious vote.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are open-sourcing our algorithm. Not sure what more they want,&#8221; Elon Musk wrote in reaction on X. Musk&#8217;s startup xAI owns X.</p>



<p>The Berlin Court of Appeal&#8217;s ruling is not related to the type of algorithm used, but it orders X to share information, including the reach and engagement of posts related to Hungary&#8217;s parliamentary election, Democracy Reporting International, one of the two plaintiffs, said late on Tuesday.</p>



<p>A court spokesperson said on Wednesday that the ruling takes immediate effect.</p>



<p>The decision is seen as a milestone in implementing the EU&#8217;s Digital Services Act, a regulation that requires major online platforms to provide researchers with access to data to monitor risks, including disinformation, hate speech, and election manipulation.</p>



<p>X did not respond to Reuters&#8217; requests for comment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">PRECEDENT FOR RESEARCHER ACCESS ESTABLISHED</h2>



<p>The plaintiffs &#8211; DRI and the Society for Civil Rights (GFF) &#8211; previously failed to obtain similar data from X for Germany&#8217;s 2025 federal election.</p>



<p>In the current case, a lower court ruled that jurisdiction lay in Ireland, where X has its EU headquarters.</p>



<p>However, the Berlin appeals court revisited the issue, determining that German courts could act when there was a local problem, such as when German-based researchers were denied crucial data for public-interest work.</p>



<p>Ruling in favour of the two NGOs, the court said X&#8217;s noncompliance affected their ability to conduct research in Germany.</p>



<p>&#8220;No appeal can be lodged against the decision,&#8221; said Joschka Selinger, a lawyer for GFF, adding that it could be enforced through penalty payments if X fails to comply.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HUNGARY ELECTION PUSHES TRANSPARENCY DEBATE</h2>



<p>Hungary&#8217;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban is facing the biggest challenge to his rule since his Fidesz party took power in 2010 as the centre-right opposition&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarys-tisza-party-leads-pre-election-poll-far-right-party-course-parliament-2026-02-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tisza party leads</a>&nbsp;in most opinion polls. Pro-government pollsters, however, put Fidesz in the lead, while many voters remain undecided.</p>



<p>Previous elections in Hungary have been overshadowed by reports of media bias and disinformation.</p>



<p>The Hungarian government did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Wednesday.</p>



<p>DRI contended that the court order would lower barriers for civil society groups across Europe seeking to enforce digital rights through national courts.</p>



<p>Observers view the decision as a signal to major platforms operating under the DSA that failure to facilitate researcher access could lead to legal consequences in EU member states.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University in the United States, Prof William Kwasi Peprah, has urged Ghana to use the current surge in gold prices to protect the economy against future shocks.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, Prof Peprah said Ghana must take advantage of what he described as a windfall and set up a dedicated gold stabilisation fund to cushion the country when prices fall.</p>



<p>“So now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold, to put in that money to guard against… that will come in,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah described the Gold Board concept as a good idea but warned that, for it to work effectively, it must be backed by a clear stabilisation account, similar to those already in place for cocoa and petroleum.</p>



<p>“So the gold board idea is very good. However… the one that exists is a cocoa one, and we also have one for petroleum. If the gold board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold,” he stressed.</p>



<p>He explained that gold prices are rising due to global uncertainty and investor behaviour. He said gold is traded based on three main angles: fear, inflation, and currency hedging.</p>



<p>“One, when there is fear… and then a currency hedge… we currently have fear, so many things happening in the world, which makes investors uncertain. So that is why we are seeing the gold price really, really moving up,” he said.</p>



<p>He also pointed to currency pressures as another driver of the current rally.</p>



<p>“We’ve noticed that the US dollar is devaluing, and that’s why we see investors moving into gold,” he added.</p>



<p>While he acknowledged that gold has historically risen over time, he cautioned that prices can still fall and Ghana must prepare for that possibility.</p>



<p>“The law is good, the operationalisation is where we must watch it carefully and make sure that… the price… will still start to come down,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said the stabilisation fund should be designed to support the gold industry and the broader economy when gold prices eventually decline.</p>



<p>“My advice… is that whatever amount of gold sales that is coming that we are putting in our balance of payment account, and we create that fund just for gold, and then to make sure that when the price starts to drop, we’ll be able to use it support the gold industry in Ghana,” he said.</p>



<p>He also raised concerns about how the Gold Board will be financed, warning that weak financing could create future challenges.</p>



<p>“The financing model for the gold board also needs to be looked at a little bit,” he said.</p>



<p>He noted that the Gold Board has relied on government funding, but those releases have been inconsistent.</p>



<p>“It has raised, getting money from the government of Ghana, which we know the amount they promised was not fully released in 2025,” he said.</p>



<p>He added that with the Bank of Ghana set to exit financing the gold trade, the Gold Board must carefully review the alternative model provided in the law.</p>



<p>“In the law, it allows them to take money in advance from whoever needs gold, and then be able to give them the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah warned that without the right structure, the Gold Board could risk becoming another troubled commodity institution.</p>



<p>“So that gold board does not tend to the next Coco board,” he cautioned.</p>



<p>He concluded that Ghana must avoid overdependence on gold in the absence of a robust buffer, particularly given the volatility of other commodities.</p>



<p>“If we feel on gold… our trade balance will move into a very struggling position,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University in the US has urged Ghana to urgently establish a Gold Stabilisation Fund to protect the economy against future shocks from falling gold prices.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, Prof. William Kwasi Peprah said Ghana’s new Gold Board framework is a good idea but warned that, without a dedicated stabilisation account, the country could face serious difficulties when the current price boom cools.</p>



<p>“The gold board idea is very good,” he said, adding that if the structure is to succeed, Ghana must take lessons from existing commodity stabilisation models. </p>



<p>“As I talked about the commodity stabilisation account… the one that exists is a cocoa one, and we also have one for petroleum. Exactly. If the gold board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold.”</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah explained that gold prices are being driven up by global uncertainty and investor behaviour, and that Ghana should not assume that high prices will persist. </p>



<p>He noted that gold is traded globally from three key perspectives: fear, inflation, and currency hedging.</p>



<p>“We currently have fear… so many things happening in the world which makes investors uncertain,” he said, arguing that this uncertainty is driving gold prices sharply upward. </p>



<p>He also linked the trend to inflation expectations and currency movements. “We’ve noticed that the US dollar is devaluing, and that’s why we see investors moving into gold.”</p>



<p>While he described Ghana’s law on the Gold Board as sound, he cautioned that the real test lies in implementation. </p>

<p>“To me, the law is good; the operationalisation is where we must watch it carefully,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah said the current period should be treated as a rare opportunity to save and prepare. </p>



<p>“So now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold, to put in that money to guard against… that will come in.”</p>



<p>He advised that proceeds from gold sales should be used not only for immediate balance-of-payments support but also for future stability. </p>



<p>“Whatever amount of gold sales that is coming that we are putting in our balance of payment account, and we create that fund just for gold,” he said, explaining that the fund would help Ghana support the industry and the economy when prices fall.</p>



<p>He also welcomed efforts to add value locally. “It’s good. We are doing a refinery to add on value,” he said, but insisted that a stabilisation fund remains essential.</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah further raised concerns about the Gold Boardis financing, warning that it must not become another struggling commodity institution. “The financing model for the gold board also needs to be looked at a little bit,” he said.</p>



<p>He noted that the Gold Board has relied on government support, but that the promised funds have not been fully disbursed. </p>



<p>“It has raised, getting money from the government of Ghana, which we know the amount they promised were not fully released in 2025,” he said.</p>



<p>He also noted that the Bank of Ghana is expected to exit financing for the gold trade, making it urgent for the Gold Board to adopt sustainable funding options. </p>



<p>“Bank of Ghana is going to exit from financing the gold trade,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah suggested that the law already provides an alternative approach. “It allows them to take money in advance from whoever needs gold, and then be able to give them the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>He stressed that Ghana must not confuse a revolving fund with a stabilisation fund. </p>



<p>“Gold board, they have a revolving fund. Revolving fund account is not the same as stabilisation fund account,” he said.</p>



<p>He warned that if Ghana fails to plan now, the country could be exposed when prices eventually decline. “If we fail on gold… our trade balance will move into a very struggling position,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An associate professor of Finance at Andrews University in the U.S. has endorsed the Gold Board initiative but warned that the country must prepare for a possible downturn in global gold prices.</p>



<p>Prof Willian Kwasi Peprah, speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, said, “So the gold board idea is very good.” </p>



<p>However, he stressed that the policy&#8217;s success will depend on how it is operationalised and on whether Ghana builds buffers to manage future shocks.</p>



<p>He pointed to the country’s existing commodity stabilisation accounts for cocoa and petroleum and argued that gold must not be left out.</p>



<p>“If the gold board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah explained that while gold prices have been rising, history shows that such price movements are not permanent, and Ghana must plan for a decline.</p>



<p>“We know from history, gold price… has always been going up… [but] we must watch it carefully and make sure that… the price… will still start to come down,” he said.</p>



<p>He said that gold trading is driven primarily by three factors: fear, inflation, and currency hedging.</p>



<p>“We currently have fear… so many things happening in the world, which makes investors uncertain. So that is why we are seeing the gold price really, really moving up,” he said.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSCZdNE0E_o?si=adO3gewCnJNKrb8T" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>On inflation, he noted that “The IMF and World Bank projects are being a little bit moderate.” He added that currency movements are also prompting investors to allocate to gold.</p>



<p>“We’ve noticed that the US dollar is devaluing, and that’s why we see investors moving into gold,” he explained.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said Ghana must treat the current high prices as a windfall and save part of the proceeds.</p>



<p>“So now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold, to put in that money to guard against… that will come in,” he said.</p>



<p>He advised the Gold Board, the Bank of Ghana and government to create a dedicated fund from gold sales.</p>



<p>“My advice to probably the gold board, the central bank and the government is that whatever amount of gold sales that is coming… we create that fund just for gold,” he said.</p>



<p>He stated that the purpose is to ensure that Ghana can support the gold industry when prices fall.</p>



<p>“When the price starts to drop, we’ll be able to use it support the gold industry in Ghana,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah welcomed efforts to refine gold locally to add value, but insisted a stabilisation fund remains necessary.</p>



<p>“It’s good. We are doing a refinery to add value, but that commodity fund for gold is needed,” he said.</p>



<p>He also raised concerns about the Gold Board&#8217;s financing structure, noting that it must be carefully examined to avoid future problems.</p>



<p>“The financing model for the gold board also needs to be looked at a little bit,” he said.</p>



<p>He noted that the Gold Board has relied on government funding, but “the amount they promised was not fully released in 2025.” </p>



<p>Prof Peprah also stated that the Bank of Ghana is expected to exit financing for the gold trade.</p>



<p>He cited a legal precedent that permits the Gold Board to accept payments in advance from buyers.</p>



<p>“It allows them to take money in advance from whoever needs gold, and then be able to give them the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof. Peprah warned that the financing model must be properly structured so that the Gold Board does not become “the next Coco board.”</p>



<p>He added that Ghana’s trade position could weaken if the country becomes too dependent on gold without a buffer.</p>



<p>“If we fail on gold… our trade balance will move into a very struggling position,” he cautioned.</p>

<p>An Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University in the U.S. has endorsed Ghana’s Gold Board concept but warned that poor implementation and weak financing could turn it into “the next COCOBOD.”</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, Prof. Willian Kwasi Peprah said the idea behind the Gold Board is “very good,” but stressed that the real risk lies in its operationalisation.</p>



<p>“To me, the law is good. The operationalisation is where we must watch it carefully,” he said, arguing that Ghana must not repeat past institutional mistakes.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said a key gap in the Gold Board framework is the absence of a dedicated commodity stabilisation account for gold. </p>



<p>He noted that Ghana already has stabilisation accounts for cocoa and petroleum, and gold must not be treated differently, especially given how global prices can swing.</p>



<p>“If the Gold Board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold,” he said.</p>



<p>He explained that gold prices are currently enjoying a windfall, driven by global uncertainty, inflation fears and currency hedging. According to him, gold trading is shaped by three main factors: fear, inflation, and currency.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSCZdNE0E_o?si=adO3gewCnJNKrb8T" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“We currently have fear… so many things happening in the world, which makes investors uncertain. So that is why we are seeing the gold price really, really moving up,” he said.</p>



<p>He also pointed to currency movements as a major driver. “We’ve noticed that the US dollar is devaluing, and that’s why we see investors moving into gold,” he added.</p>



<p>However, he warned that Ghana must not assume prices will remain high indefinitely. He said the country must use the current gains to prepare for the inevitable downturn.</p>



<p>“Now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said the proposed fund should be built from gold sales and used to protect the industry and the economy when prices begin to fall.</p>



<p>“My advice… is that whatever amount of gold sales that is coming… we create that fund just for gold,” he said. “When the price starts to drop, we’ll be able to use it [to] support the gold industry in Ghana.”</p>



<p>He welcomed Ghana’s plans for a refinery to add value, but insisted that a stabilisation fund is still necessary to shield the economy from price shocks.</p>



<p>He also raised concerns about the Gold Board’s financing model, noting that the institution has depended on government support but that promised funds were not fully released in 2025, while the Bank of Ghana is expected to exit financing of the gold trade.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah cited a provision of the law that permits the Gold Board to accept advance payments from buyers and supply them with gold, noting that the model must be examined carefully.</p>



<p>“That model must be really looked at… so that Gold Board does not tend to the next COCOBOD,” he warned.</p>



<p>He stressed that a revolving fund is not the same as a stabilisation fund and stated that Ghana must clearly distinguish between the two structures.</p>



<p>“Revolving fund account is not the same as stabilisation fund account,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah cautioned that, without adequate buffers, Ghana’s trade position could suffer significantly if gold prices decline.</p>



<p>“If we fail on gold… our trade balance will move into a very struggling position,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> Ivory Coast is considering cutting the price it pays farmers for cocoa beans to align with <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ghana-cuts-farmgate-cocoa-price-introduces-new-financing-model-2026-02-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghana&#8217;s</a>, two government sources told Reuters, as the world&#8217;s two largest</span> producers of the chocolate ingredient face a major <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/cocoa-stocks-main-harvest-pile-up-ivory-coast-warehouses-2026-02-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crisis</a>.</p>



<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Senior Ivory Coast officials said all options were on the table as the government debates whether to follow Ghana, which has already cut its farmgate price by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ghana-cuts-farmgate-cocoa-price-introduces-new-financing-model-2026-02-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28.6% for the rest</a> of the 2025/2026 season&#8217;s</span> main crop, in coordination with Abidjan, as it adjusts to plunging prices.</p>



<p>The farmgate price, set at the start of the harvest season, is the amount of money farmers receive for their product after harvest and before any intermediaries, exporters, processors, traders, or cooperatives add value.</p>



<p>The discussions with Ghana and within the Ivorian government on cutting the price to align with Ghana have not previously been reported.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Ivory Coast–Ghana Cocoa Initiative (ICCIG) said the two African countries, which together account for about 60% of global output, had been coordinating closely since the onset of the sector crisis.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have put all options on the table, and discussions are progressing well. Courageous and realistic decisions will be taken soon,&#8221; the first Ivory Coast official said, requesting anonymity because they are not authorised to speak on the issue.</p>



<p>The second official said the continued price fall, which has seen cocoa drop by nearly 50% in recent months, left the government with little room to manoeuvre.</p>



<p>Cocoa futures on the ICE exchange fell to their lowest level in 2-1/2 years on Tuesday, as concerns about unsold cocoa stocks in the Ivory Coast and Ghana continued to weigh on prices.</p>



<p>&#8220;We must think about the survival of the cocoa sector in the Ivory Coast. We need to act; changes are underway,&#8221; the source said, declining to disclose further details.</p>



<p>An inter-ministerial committee has met over the issue, and a decision could come soon, the two sources said.</p>



<p>A spokesperson for the Ivory Coast government did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">MEASURES TO PREVENT STRUCTURAL DAMAGE</h2>



<p>Alex Assanvo, ICCIG&#8217;s executive secretary, said the two countries were adapting to the sudden market reversal and had taken measures to prevent structural damage.</p>



<p>He said the trading rooms of the Ivory Coast&#8217;s Coffee and Cocoa Council and Ghana&#8217;s COCOBOD remained in regular contact.</p>



<p>Assanvo also defended the Living Income Differential, introduced in 2019 to boost farmers&#8217; earnings, noting that recent market volatility underscores its relevance.</p>



<p>ICCIG is preparing a meeting between the two countries to strengthen coordination amid financial pressures on farmers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The organisation remains mobilised to coordinate policies in both countries,&#8221; Assanvo said, adding that all players in the sector would be convened to review market developments and propose improvements to price-stabilisation mechanisms.</p>



<p>Exporters and buyers expect the Ivory Coast to announce a cut soon, saying the question is no longer if but when.</p>



<p>&#8220;The country is resisting, but for how long? I don&#8217;t see Ivory Coast doing something different from Ghana,&#8221; said the head of an Abidjan-based export company.</p>

<p>Microsoft said on Wednesday it did not think the U.S. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cambodian-national-dies-ice-custody-indiana-2026-02-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency</a> was using its technology for mass surveillance of civilians, but added that it provided cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools to ICE.</p>



<p>The statement from the technology company came in response to a report by The Guardian that said ICE deepened its reliance on Microsoft&#8217;s cloud technology last year as the agency ramped up arrest and deportation operations. The newspaper cited leaked documents.</p>



<p>ICE more than tripled the amount of data it stored in Microsoft&#8217;s Azure cloud platform in the six months leading up to January 2026, a period in which the agency&#8217;s budget swelled and its workforce rapidly expanded, The Guardian reported, adding ICE appeared to be using a range of Microsoft&#8217;s productivity tools, as well as AI-driven products, to search and analyze the data it holds in Azure.</p>



<p>&#8220;As we&#8217;ve previously said, Microsoft provides cloud-based productivity and collaboration tools to DHS (Department of Homeland Security, of which ICE is a part) and ICE, delivered through our key partners,&#8221; a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement.</p>



<p>&#8220;Microsoft policies and terms of service do not allow our technology to be used for the mass surveillance of civilians, and we do not believe ICE is engaged in such activity.&#8221;</p>



<p>The company said the U.S. Congress, the executive branch and the courts should draw &#8220;clear legal lines&#8221; regarding the permissible use of emerging technologies by law enforcement.</p>



<p>ICE said it will not comment on specifics involving investigative techniques, tools and technologies used in ongoing criminal probes but said it uses various forms of technology to aid arrests of criminals.</p>



<p>U.S. President&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump&#8217;s</a>&nbsp;immigration crackdown has faced criticism from human rights advocates who say it creates an unsafe environment and lacks due process. ICE has become the symbol of Trump&#8217;s crackdown, especially after the fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens last month.</p>



<p>Trump has said his actions aim to improve domestic security and curb illegal immigration.</p>



<p>Tech companies have attempted to warm their ties with Trump during his second term in office.</p>



<p>Microsoft has also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/microsoft-disables-services-israel-defense-unit-after-review-2025-09-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously faced scrutiny</a> over the use of its technology by governments. Last September, the company said it had disabled some services used by an Israeli military unit after preliminary evidence supported a media investigation that reported mass surveillance of Palestinian phone calls. </p>



<p>The ties to Israel&#8217;s military had led to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/microsoft-fires-four-workers-on-site-protests-over-companys-ties-israel-2025-08-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protests within the company</a> and some protesters were fired.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A 71-year-old ballroom dancer said she had no idea she had been cast in a Taylor Swift music video until ten minutes before filming.</p>



<p>Denise Sides, from Wrexham, was selected by the global megastar to appear in Opalite &#8211; a 90s-inspired rom-com that brought together the cast of an episode of the Graham Norton show.</p>



<p>The dance teacher said she auditioned for an &#8220;unknown artist&#8221; and once cast, the top-secret job involved being sent to the filming location in discreet transport.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then this young girl walks in, all dressed up, and she comes over and says, &#8216;Hi, I&#8217;m Taylor,&#8221; said Sides. &#8220;I was like, no way. Oh my God.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sides, who has been dancing for 60 years and teaches ballroom classes, said she had signed up for TV extra work through an agency and responded to a call-out for senior dancers on behalf of an &#8220;unknown artist&#8221;.</p>



<p>After being shortlisted, Sides received a call confirming she had been specifically chosen by the artist out of hundreds of applications.</p>



<p>But she had no idea record-breaking Swift was behind the request.</p>



<p>Sides said the whole experience was &#8220;hush-hush&#8221; and all she had been told was that the job involved recreating a dance competition.</p>



<p>It was only ten minutes before filming began that she found out the video was for a track from Swift&#8217;s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl.</p>



<p>Sides, a Swiftie herself, said she was in shock when the singer walked in.</p>



<p>&#8220;I still feel excited now [remembering it],&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Sides said Swift, who sang in and directed the video, put everyone at ease during filming and thanked dancers for their time.</p>



<p>&#8220;She knew exactly what she wanted. She&#8217;d say, &#8216;try this, try that,&#8217; and she was really nice about it,&#8221; said the dance teacher.</p>



<p>&#8220;Some can be a bit abrupt, but she wasn&#8217;t. She was lovely and so talented.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the video, Sides is seen wearing a royal-blue ballroom-dancing outfit she has owned since becoming a professional dancer in 1988.</p>



<p>She said Swift complimented her outfit and said, &#8220;I love your dress. It really fits the set.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e9c6/live/edd590e0-0366-11f1-bab5-81d0d0b0abce.jpg.webp" alt="TAS Rights Management Graham Norton, Taylor Swift and Domhnall Gleeson in the video for Taylor Swift&#039;s Opalite" style="width:840px;height:auto" title="You&#039;re never too old, says dancer, 71, cast in Taylor Swift video"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Graham Norton&#8217;s chat show played a role in the video&#8217;s casting</figcaption></figure>



<p>When Sides saw the video, which was filmed in November but released earlier this month, she said she was gobsmacked.</p>



<p>&#8220;You just can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s you,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>It was difficult to keep the experience a secret too, she added: &#8220;It was hard, I only told a few people in my dance class and my family.&#8221;</p>



<p>Opalite features Domhnall Gleeson, Lewis Capaldi, Greta Lee, and a cameo voiceover from Cillian Murphy, all of whom appeared on the Graham Norton show with Swift in October.</p>



<p>It tells the story of a lonely woman who uses a magical spray to improve her life and finds romance with a fellow loner.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2fff/live/b0ae7700-0365-11f1-b5e2-dd58fc65f0f6.jpg.webp" alt="Matt Crossick / PA Media The cast of Taylor Swift&#039;s Opalite video on Graham Norton&#039;s sofa" style="width:840px;height:auto" title="You&#039;re never too old, says dancer, 71, cast in Taylor Swift video"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The video&#8217;s cast all featured on Graham Norton&#8217;s chat show last October</figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite dancing her whole life and with decades of acting experience, Sides said the shoot with Swift was the most important of her career.</p>



<p>She said she hoped her experience would inspire others to try dancing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe people will think, &#8216;Well, if Taylor chose her, why don&#8217;t we?&#8217;,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re never too old. It was an experience I will never, ever forget.&#8221;</p>



<p>In addition to running Dens Dance Studio since the 1990s, Sides also hosts inclusive workshops for those with disabilities.</p>



<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m not teaching, I&#8217;m dancing myself,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s my happy place, my passion.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Africa&#8217;s largest economies, Nigeria and South Africa, are driving the strongest growth in demand for stablecoins and are the most optimistic about their potential, according to a survey, with many users also wanting them to become more widely accepted.</p>



<p>Stablecoins are promising faster and cheaper ways to move money in poorer countries, but as 99% of them, including the dominant Tether and USDC, are pegged to the dollar, they also raise&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/central-bank-body-bis-delivers-stark-stablecoin-warning-2025-06-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worries</a>&nbsp;about economic dollarisation and capital flight.</p>



<p>The survey, titled the Stablecoin Utility Report and conducted by YouGov with crypto firms BVNK, Coinbase, and Artemis, collected responses from more than 4,650 individuals in 15 countries who either hold or plan to hold stablecoins or cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The use of the coins today is largely for moving money between cryptocurrency markets. Nearly nine-tenths of stablecoin transactions relate to crypto trading, while just 6% are for payment of goods or services, BCG estimated in a report last year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">PREFERENCE FOR STABLECOIN PAYMENTS</h2>



<p>The report, which also found growing demand for stablecoins in other emerging countries such as India, showed over half of those surveyed had increased stablecoin holdings in the last year, with developing economies seeing the strongest trends.</p>



<p>Almost 80% of Nigerian and South African respondents already held stablecoins, the figures showed, with over 75% of those also intending to increase their holdings further in the coming year.</p>



<p>Among non-owners, the intent to start holding stablecoins was roughly twice as high in low and middle-income economies than in high-income ones, with 95% of Nigerian respondents saying they would prefer to receive payments in stablecoins than in the Naira.</p>



<p>&#8220;People are already getting paid and spending stablecoins, especially where traditional payments are slow, expensive, or unreliable,&#8221; said Chris Harmse, co-founder of BVNK.</p>



<p>But they are also &#8220;asking for greater integration into their existing financial tools,&#8221; he added.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zgvoyqerxvd/Pasted%20image%201771339585825.png" alt="Stablecoin spending and desired spending" title="Biggest African economies lead stablecoin demand growth, study shows"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Stablecoin spending and desired spending</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">THREAT TO MONETARY POLICY</h2>



<p>Globally, the stablecoin market is valued at more than $310 billion, dominated by U.S.-pegged tokens such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/tether-ceo-aims-allocate-up-15-its-portfolio-gold-2026-01-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tether</a>&nbsp;($185 billion) and USDC ($75 billion). The market is expected to expand further following U.S. regulatory moves, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/companies-plan-stablecoins-under-new-law-experts-say-hurdles-remain-2025-08-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the GENIUS Act.</a></p>



<p>However, central bankers in emerging economies remain cautious. They fear <span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">that stablecoins <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/stablecoins-could-suck-1-trillion-em-banks-next-three-years-standard-chartered-2025-10-07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could drain</a> domestic bank deposits, undermine monetary policy, and facilitate</span> capital flight.</p>



<p>South African Reserve Bank Governor Lesetja Kganyago pointed out a potential benefit, noting remittance fees as high as $30 to send $100 to neighbouring Mozambique, a gap stablecoins could help address.</p>



<p>The survey also highlighted limited acceptance of stablecoins in retail settings and online as a barrier to broader adoption for everyday purchases and subscriptions.</p>

<p>The International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday it has approved about $91 million in funding for Niger after completing reviews of programs under its Extended Credit Facility and Resilience and Sustainability Facility.</p>



<p>The IMF said completion of the reviews would unlock about $61 million under the ECF-supported program and about $30 million under the RSF program, adding that Niger&#8217;s economic growth is expected to remain strong at 6.7% in 2026.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Pilgrims Affairs Office of Ghana (PAOG) has officially suspended all activities related to the 2026 Hajj arrangements, effective immediately, citing “immeasurable pressure” on administrators.</p>



<p>In a statement signed by the Director of Communications, Mohammed Amin Lamptey Hussein, said all operational processes leading to this year’s Hajj — including payments, documentation and submission of required materials — have been duly concluded, barring any unforeseeable circumstances.</p>



<p>The Office stressed that only prospective pilgrims who submitted their passports and all required documents within the stipulated timeframe were considered for visa processing.</p>



<p>“Visa processing could not commence without full compliance with the documentation requirements,” the statement noted.</p>



<p>PAOG also urged prospective pilgrims to take key administrative steps seriously, noting that early payment, effective medical screening, and timely passport submission are measures that would significantly contribute to a smoother, more efficient Hajj process.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="722" height="1024" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1832-722x1024.png" alt="2026 Hajj: Pilgrims Affairs Office closes arrangements, ends payments and documentation" class="wp-image-10032981724" title="2026 Hajj: Pilgrims Affairs Office closes arrangements, ends payments and documentation" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1832-722x1024.png 722w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1832-212x300.png 212w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1832-768x1089.png 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1832-1083x1536.png 1083w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1832-99x140.png 99w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1832-88x125.png 88w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1832-176x250.png 176w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1832-106x150.png 106w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1832-299x424.png 299w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1832-35x50.png 35w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1832.png 1128w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" /></figure>



<p>The statement said medical screening has been successfully completed in selected regions and centres, with the remaining screenings for the Ashanti and Greater Accra Regions scheduled for February 22 and February 28, respectively.</p>



<p>PAOG further indicated that lessons from this year’s operations will be used to strengthen future Hajj arrangements, ensuring greater efficiency, transparency, and improved service delivery.</p>



<p>The Office also issued a reminder to prospective pilgrims under special arrangements (Protocol) to submit their passports as soon as possible to complete the process.</p>



<p>They were also directed to participate in the medical screening either in Kumasi or at the Hajj Village in Accra.</p>



<p>PAOG advised all prospective pilgrims and stakeholders to await further official communication on the subsequent phases of the pilgrimage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The upcoming presidential election of the Ghana Chess Association has taken a new turn following the submission of two separate formal petitions challenging Christiana Ashley&#8217;s candidacy.</p>



<p>The contest, now widely seen as a straight race between Ashley and David Achempong, has shifted beyond routine electoral competition into a broader debate about governance standards, institutional independence and reputational risk.</p>



<p>Within the official objection window, Association members submitted two documented protests to the Electoral Committee, challenging Ms Ashley’s eligibility.</p>



<p>Both petitions cite adverse findings contained in the report of the Justice Amadu Tanko Committee, which was established after the 2018 Commonwealth Games visa controversy.</p>



<p>The Committee’s report, which remains part of the public record, stated that Ms Ashley’s continued role in sports administration at any level was “no longer tenable.”</p>



<p>Petitioners argue that such a finding cannot be ignored when assessing the suitability of a candidate for the highest office of a national sports federation. They also warn that allowing the candidacy under these circumstances could expose the Association to reputational damage and weaken stakeholder confidence.</p>



<p>Beyond the past findings, concerns have also been raised about Ms Ashley’s employment status.</p>



<p>Stakeholders note that she is a staff member of the National Sports Authority, administratively assigned to the Ghana Chess Association.</p>



<p>Some members have questioned whether it is consistent with good governance for a state-assigned administrative officer within the Association to simultaneously contest for the highest elected leadership position in the same body.</p>



<p>The concerns being raised are largely structural and governance-based. They include whether the arrangement creates a perceived conflict of roles, blurs the distinction between administrative appointment and electoral mandate, and could affect the Association&#8217;s independence.</p>



<p>Observers note that in modern sports governance, perception alone can influence credibility.</p>



<p>Opposing candidate David Achempong is being promoted by supporters as a continuity and reform figure within Ghana Chess.</p>



<p>His backers argue that under his leadership, the Association&#8217;s involvement in the chess ecosystem has grown, with more tournaments and regional activity, increased youth and school participation, stronger visibility, and improved stakeholder engagement.</p>



<p>Supporters insist that the current momentum should not be interrupted by controversy.</p>



<p>Some stakeholders are framing the election as more than a contest between two individuals. Instead, it is being described as a referendum on governance culture within Ghana Chess.</p>



<p>With two formal protests already on record and governance questions now in public view, attention has turned to the Electoral Committee’s decision on eligibility and how delegates weigh ambition against institutional credibility.</p>



<p>As many in the chess community note, every move has consequences — and the decision made in this election could shape Ghana Chess&#8217;s reputation for years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A Cape Coast Circuit Court has remanded into Police custody Patrick Nii Torto, a man accused of using the Office of the Vice President to swindle people with the ploy of securing them Canadian visas and work permits.</p>



<p>Torto allegedly scammed his victims out of GH¢5,325 and GH¢8,200, posing as a Vice Presidential staffer and captain in the Ghana Armed Forces.</p>



<p>Operating under the name Dr Patrick Nelson Ayittey, Torto also made his victims believe that he had affiliations with the Canadian Embassy in Ghana, the police told the court on Tuesday.</p>



<p>He pleaded not guilty to the charge of defrauding by false pretences, but the court, presided over by Madam Nana Aba Quiaba Nunoo, remanded him into police custody to assist in further investigations.</p>



<p>Torto was arrested from his hideout at Abura by the police in Cape Coast following a complaint filed against him at the Abura police Station on Monday, February 16.</p>



<p>According to the Police, the accused person scammed his victims between December 2025 and January 2026 and failed to refund their monies despite repeated demands.</p>



<p>The Police conducted a search at his residence and found about 10 Ghanaian passports and other documents, including school certificates, birth certificates, and Ghana Cards.</p>



<p>Further enquiries also revealed that the suspect was neither an officer of the Ghana Armed Forces or a worker at the Vice President’s Office and had no affiliations with the Canadian Embassy.</p>



<p>The Police also gathered that Torto was not a medical doctor or doctorate degree holder.</p>



<p>He is expected to reappear before the court on Tuesday, March 03, 2026.</p>
