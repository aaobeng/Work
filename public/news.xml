										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Executive Director of the Media Foundation for West Africa (MFWA), Sulemana Braimah, says he is pleased with the dismissal of removal petitions against the Special Prosecutor and officials of the Electoral Commission (EC), describing the outcome as a positive sign for Ghana’s democracy.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy FM’s Super Morning Show, Mr Braimah said the decision demonstrates the strength and independence of Ghana’s institutions.</p>



<p>“I think in a democracy, when you find that institutions are independent and strong, I think that is really helpful,” he said.</p>



<p>His comments follow the Chief Justice&#8217;s decision to dismiss petitions seeking the removal of the Special Prosecutor and EC officials, allowing them to remain in office.</p>



<p>Mr Braimah reflected on the political tensions that have surrounded the Electoral Commission in recent years. He noted that during the period when the National Democratic Congress (NDC) was in opposition, the Commission faced heavy criticism.</p>



<p>“We’ve come from a period when, right in the days of the NDC in opposition, the commentary and so on and so forth was absolutely not too good for the Electoral Commission,” he said.</p>



<p>He added that at one point, many EC decisions appeared to align with the position of the then-governing New Patriotic Party (NPP).</p>



<p>“We got to a point where almost every decision of the EC was sort of always in line with what the NPP says their position is,” he stated.</p>



<p>“It got to a point where it was almost like, okay, the EC says this, the NPP says we agree. The NPP says this, and it appears to be the same position as the EC.”</p>

<p>According to him, this generated strong concerns from the NDC, although he acknowledged that such reactions are common in partisan politics.</p>



<p>“At all times, the opposition would always be against the EC or speak against the EC’s decision, and we are beginning to see that now,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Braimah argued that the real test of institutional independence comes when due process does not favour the party in power.</p>



<p>“If we’ve gone through all this, and then the party comes to power, and the leadership of the party says these people must go, and then a process is rolled out, in the end, the Chief Justice says, well, nothing has been established, and the people stay in power,” he explained.</p>



<p>He pointed out that the Chief Justice was appointed under the same government, making the ruling even more significant in his view.</p>



<p>“We’re also talking about a Chief Justice who was recently appointed under the same government. For me, it is fulfilling that we have institutions that appear to be independent, strong.”</p>



<p>He also cited a recent Supreme Court ruling on the Kpandai High Court decision as another example of institutions working in accordance with the law rather than political pressure.</p>



<p>“It is not about the wishes of the government in power. It is about what the law says. And it’s about the interpretation of the adjudicating bodies,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Braimah maintained that such developments strengthen Ghana’s democratic system.</p>



<p>“That, for me, is what would make our democracy strong and resilient. And that’s why I’m happy about this decision.”</p>

<p>The Director General of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), COP Lydia Yaako Donkor, has engaged executives of the Nigeria Transport Association in Ghana to bolster collaboration in the fight against human trafficking.</p>



<p>The meeting is part of ongoing efforts by the Ghana Police Service to enhance stakeholder partnerships and preventive measures against crime.</p>



<p>COP Donkor highlighted the crucial role transport operators play in detecting and reporting suspicious activities, noting that traffickers often exploit transport networks to move victims across borders and within the sub-region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The National Anti-Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS) has stopped a bribery attempt by three suspected galamsey operators following the seizure of illegal mining equipment in Bekwai Municipality, Ashanti Region.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, February 18, the task force resumed its anti-galamsey operations, returning to Edwinase and Kokotro, where earlier raids had forced illegal miners to flee.</p>



<p>At Kokotro, the team uncovered a galamsey site dangerously situated within the town, posing risks to lives, property, and the environment.</p>



<p>During the operation, NAIMOS dismantled makeshift structures, destroyed industrial pumping machines, and removed other illegal mining equipment, while seizing a Liugong excavator, two Liugong monitors, and an unregistered motorcycle.</p>



<p>While heading back to their base, the task force was approached by three men, Emmanuel Koblah, Samuel Addai, and Kofi Frimpong, in a black Tundra F150 (registration GR 4743–16), who claimed ownership of the Kokotro site and tried to bribe them with GHC 119,825 to recover the confiscated items.</p>



<p>The trio was promptly arrested after the task force rejected the bribe and handed them over to the Bekwai Police Station for investigation and prosecution. The seized bribe, excavator, monitors, and vehicle are now held at NAIMOS headquarters.</p>



<p>NAIMOS has cautioned illegal miners and their collaborators that bribing officers will lead to swift arrest and prosecution.</p>



<p>The Secretariat also called on local authorities and security agencies to step up monitoring of previously raided sites to prevent the resumption of illegal mining activities.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

<p>The Governor of the Bank of Ghana (BoG) Dr Johnson Asiama has cautioned commercial banks against excessive reliance on net interest income, warning that a changing interest rate environment could test the resilience of earnings across the industry.</p>



<p>Addressing heads of banks in Accra on February 18, 2026, the governor noted that while interest income remains a core component of banking operations, overdependence on it poses risks.</p>



<p>“There is nothing inherently problematic about net interest income. However, a high dependence on it increases sensitivity to interest rate cycles and sovereign exposure dynamics.”</p>



<p>His comments come at a time when Ghana’s monetary conditions are gradually normalising, leading to tighter spreads and declining yields on government securities, traditionally a significant source of bank profitability.</p>



<p>Dr Asiama stressed that as the rate environment stabilises, margins are likely to compress, making it imperative for banks to rethink their revenue strategies.</p>



<p>“As margins compress in a normalizing rate environment, earnings resilience will increasingly depend on diversification, particularly through transactional banking, trade services, payments, treasury activities, and other fee-based income streams that are less balance-sheet intensive.”</p>



<p>The remarks signal a strategic shift in regulatory expectations, with the central bank encouraging institutions to strengthen non-interest income streams and reduce concentration risks tied to sovereign instruments.</p>



<p>The engagement forms part of the central bank’s ongoing supervisory dialogue aimed at strengthening financial stability and ensuring Ghana’s banking sector remains resilient amid evolving macroeconomic conditions.</p>

<p>A 20-year-old seamstress apprentice, Gifty Aba Otuba, died on the spot after she was knocked down by a motorcycle at Gomoa Biakoye on the Kasoa–Winneba Highway.</p>



<p>The accident occurred at Gomoa Biakoye in the Gomoa East District of the Central Region. The deceased was reportedly crossing the highway to deliver smoked fish to chop bar operators before returning to work.</p>



<p>Speaking to Adom News, the deceased’s parents, who are fishmongers, said they had sent their daughter to deliver the smoked fish to customers on the opposite side of the road.</p>



<p>According to them, while she was crossing the busy highway, a motorcyclist travelling from Fetteh Kakraba towards Kasoa knocked her down, and she died instantly.</p>



<p>The rider, who sustained serious injuries, was rushed to St Gregory Hospital, where he is in a coma and receiving treatment.</p>



<p>The body of the deceased has been deposited at the St Gregory Hospital’s morgue by officers from the Awutu Bereku Police Command.</p>



<p>Police are yet to comment officially on the incident.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong><em>A Tribute by the Department of Communication Studies, University of Ghana</em></strong><strong></strong></p>



<p>For the Department of Communication Studies at the University of Ghana, Dr. Abubakari Sidick Ahmed’s passing is more than the loss of a national media icon. Known as Alhaji, he was a son of the department and a colleague in training.</p>



<p>From the earliest days of Radio Univers, our department played a key role. We provided space, intellectual support, and foundational infrastructure for its launch. What began as a bold academic-media experiment became a key broadcasting training ground in West Africa. Alhaji stood at the heart of that transformation.</p>



<p>His journey from student volunteer reporter to Station Manager mirrors the very philosophy we uphold. Theory must meet practice, and scholarship must serve society. As a proud alumnus of the Department, Alhaji embodied this philosophy with rare conviction. He did not merely manage a station; he extended the classroom.</p>



<p>For decades, Radio Univers became our laboratory, and Alhaji its chief instructor in practice. He opened the airwaves to our students and gave them invaluable real-time experience in journalism and broadcasting. He worked with them patiently. In those moments, he was not just a station manager; he was faculty in action.</p>



<p>As the only professionally trained broadcaster and media scholar at the station for many years, he ensured that our pedagogical objectives were not compromised. He developed and enforced a Code of Conduct that elevated professionalism in reporting, production, and presentation. He demanded discipline not for its own sake, but because he understood that credibility is the currency of journalism.</p>



<p>Under his leadership, the station flourished.</p>



<p>He built people, not just a station.</p>



<p>Today, his protégés fill the newsrooms of TV3, Joy FM, and Citi FM, as well as international platforms such as the BBC, Voice of America, and Deutsche Welle. Distinguished alumni, including Bernard Avle, Bola Ray, Kafui Dey, and Paa Kwesi Asare, have testified to his mentorship and belief in their potential. </p>



<p>Their tributes echo what we, as a department, have always known: Alhaji believed in people and invested in their growth.</p>



<p>But his impact did not end in the newsroom. Through his close collaboration with our department, Alhaji also helped nurture a generation of media and communication academics. Among those who passed through his hands are Dr. Theodora Dame Adjin-Tettey, now a Senior Lecturer of Journalism, Media and Communication Studies at Durban University of Technology in South Africa;&nbsp; and Dr. Kwaku Botwe, a faculty member in our department who now serves as General Manager of Radio Univers, assuming leadership after Alhaji’s retirement. In this, we see a profound truth: great leaders do not merely build institutions; they create reliable succession plans. Alhaji did both.</p>



<p>His introduction of programmes such as <em>Behind the Headlines </em>and <em>Research &amp; Innovation Agenda </em>further demonstrated his commitment to bridging academia and society. He made Univers not just a broadcasting station, but a platform for intellectual engagement and policy dialogue.</p>



<p>He championed Ghanaian music and languages at a time when Western content dominated the airwaves. And his pioneering newspaper review programme earned national recognition, a format that would later define morning broadcasting nationwide.</p>



<p>His service was recognized with the Vice-Chancellor’s Distinguished Service Award and the National Award of the Order of the Volta. Yet, for us, his greatest honour was the integrity with which he represented the department and the university in the public sphere.</p>



<p>Today, as we mourn, we also give thanks. Radio Univers stands stronger because he guarded its vision. Our graduates stand taller because he strengthened their confidence. Our department’s mission of training ethical, skilled communicators found in him a faithful partner.</p>



<p>Alhaji has signed off from this earthly frequency, but his signal remains strong in every newsroom, every studio, and every classroom shaped by his influence.</p>



<p>There will never be another Alhaji.</p>



<p>And as his department, we are proud to have called him our own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Deputy National Communications Director of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Kamal-Deen Abdulai, has called for a psychological evaluation of the suspect accused of stealing a child, stressing that such assessments should be part of the ongoing investigations.</p>



<p>His remarks come after a recent incident at Mamprobi Hospital, where a woman, allegedly disguised as a nurse, reportedly took a newborn from the postnatal ward, sparking widespread public concern.</p>



<p>Speaking on the <em>Joy News AM Show</em> on Thursday, February 19, Mr Abdulai said that while the law clearly punishes child stealing, authorities must also consider the mental and emotional state of the accused.</p>



<p>“Our laws frown on it. Section 93 of the Criminal Offences Act is clear on child stealing. Of course, even this kind of offence can be tried under abduction and kidnapping as well,” he said, emphasising the seriousness of the crime.</p>



<p>However, Mr Abdulai argued that beyond legal provisions, investigators should examine the suspect’s psychological background, especially in cases involving women who may be struggling with infertility.</p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_0hbg2o2mc?si=wxsqMqYNlouCx1lK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“But that said, in our social settings, women who find it very difficult to conceive go through a lot. That is why they also need to conduct some psychological, if you like, research on the person who is purported to have, who is alleged to have, stolen the child. What is she going through? What actually triggered it? All these things ought to be looked at,” he said.</p>



<p>Drawing comparisons with practices in more developed jurisdictions, he added, &#8220;Advanced countries, they would not just, you know, go straight to punishing, even though the act is there. They would investigate to know her status, what warranted this, and what the actual intent was. All this will be established before maybe the final docket is presented for an offence to be charged.”</p>



<p>Mr Abdulai acknowledged the intense societal pressure some women face when they are unable to conceive. “I say this because most women go through some of these problems. I am married, I don&#8217;t have a child, and the entire family is on you, off the map.”</p>



<p>Nonetheless, he was firm that such pressures cannot justify criminal conduct. “Do you have to steal a baby? No, you don&#8217;t have to at all. It&#8217;s not. That&#8217;s why I say the laws harm women adequately. It&#8217;s wrong. It&#8217;s not a proper act. It&#8217;s an immoral act.</p>



<p>“But you see, people go through a lot as well. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying. That said, it doesn&#8217;t justify what has happened,” he concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A 16-year-old girl, identified as Deborah Dede Ama, who went missing on Valentine’s Day, has been found dead in a stream at Tinkong in the Eastern Region.</p>



<p>Deborah reportedly left home on the evening of February 14 to attend a Valentine’s Day party in the Tinkong township while her mother was away.</p>



<p>However, she never returned home, raising concerns among family members.</p>



<p>The lifeless body of Deborah Ama Dede was discovered on Tuesday in a stream near their house.</p>



<p>According to a family member, Kofi Sammy, the body was found naked and already decomposing, with visible marks suggesting possible foul play.</p>



<p>Residents suspect the teenager may have been sexually assaulted before being killed by unknown assailants.</p>



<p>Police from Adawso retrieved the body from the scene and conveyed it to the mortuary for preservation and autopsy as investigations commence.</p>



<p>The mother of the deceased was inconsolable upon receiving the heartbreaking news.</p>



<p>Family members and sympathizers who gathered at the residence on Wednesday expressed shock and grief over the gruesome killing.</p>



<p>Assembly Member for Tinkong, Samuel Abochie, described the incident as devastating and called on the police to conduct a thorough investigation to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ghana Football Association President, Kurt Okraku, is optimistic the Black Starlets will excel at the upcoming U17 Africa Cup of Nations following their return to the stage. </p>



<p>The Black Starlets will be returning to the continental stage for the first time in eight years after booking a place through the WAFU B tournament played last year. </p>



<p>While there is brewing confidence among Ghanaians following the team&#8217;s qualification, Okraku is looking at first making it to the World Cup. </p>



<p>&#8220;I believe they will go to the AFCON and will make us proud,&#8221; he said in an interview with the GFA Media team.</p>



<p>&#8220;That will be a joyous moment for us again. I think that we belong to the elite group on the African continent.</p>



<p>&#8220;First [target] is to qualify to the World Cup because that is the ultimate platform.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Black Starlets&#8217; last World Cup appearance was in 2017, hosted in India, where the team went all the way to the quarterfinal stage. </p>



<p>The current setup is under the tutelage of Prosper Narteh Ogum and have been in camp since the start of the year as they wrap up preparations. </p>



<p>The U17 AFCON is scheduled to be played in Morocco in April.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minister for Local Government, Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, Ahmed Ibrahim, has revealed that more than 2,000 churches in the Greater Accra Region are operating without formal registration, raising concerns about regulatory oversight in the country’s rapidly expanding religious sector.</p>



<p>Speaking in Parliament on Wednesday, February 18, 2026, Mr Ibrahim said that although over 2,200 churches were registered in Greater Accra as of 2025, thousands more across the country continue to operate outside official records. </p>



<p>He, however,  announced plans to introduce a digital registry system to streamline church registration and provide accurate national data.</p>



<p>He explained that the initiative would involve collaboration between key state institutions to verify and track churches operating in the country.</p>



<p>“We will establish a formal collaboration with the Registrar General’s Department, the Office of the Attorney General, and the Ministry of Justice to assess records of churches registered as companies limited by guarantee,” Mr Ibrahim told Parliament.</p>



<p>The Minister said metropolitan, municipal, and district assemblies would maintain local registers of churches within their jurisdictions, while the proposed digital platform would allow religious bodies to update their operational status in real time.</p>



<p>According to available regional survey data, about 98.1% of churches in Greater Accra operate as single-owner entities, with only a small proportion affiliated with larger church organisations. Although the Registrar General’s Department does not publish a consolidated national figure, projections suggest the number of churches nationwide runs into several thousands.</p>



<p>Mr Ibrahim said the proposed system would strengthen governance and improve transparency in the religious sector.</p>



<p>“This initiative aims to ensure accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date data on churches, which will be critical for governance, planning, and regulatory oversight,” he said.</p>



<p>The move comes amid the continued growth of Christianity in Ghana. Data from the Ghana Statistical Service shows that 71.2% of Ghanaians identified as Christians in the 2021 Population and Housing Census, including 31.6% Pentecostal or Charismatic, 18.4% Protestant, 10% Catholic, and 11.2% belonging to other Christian denominations.</p>



<p>The proposed digital registry will be linked to the Registrar General’s database to enable verification of operational churches and enhance accountability within the sector.</p>



<p>Mr Ibrahim described the initiative as a necessary step toward modernising administrative systems and strengthening regulation in a sector that has witnessed rapid expansion in recent decades.</p>



<p>“This is a timely step toward modernising our administrative systems and strengthening accountability in the religious sector,” he concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, has called for the emergence of a credible third political force in Ghana, arguing that broader political competition would enhance democratic governance and national cohesion.</p>



<p>Speaking at a Political Inclusion and Consensus Building Forum organised by the African Centre for Parliamentary Affairs (ACEPA) on 18 February 2026, Mr Bagbin reflected on Ghana’s political evolution since the advent of the Fourth Republic in 1992.</p>



<p>He acknowledged that Ghana’s democratic journey has recorded significant milestones but cautioned against the over-concentration of political power.</p>



<p>The Speaker recalled his participation in the maiden congress of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) in Cape Coast, describing the event as one that embodied national diversity and unity.</p>



<p>According to him, the broad representation from across the country fostered a deep sense of belonging and collective purpose.</p>



<p>He added that he had also attended congresses of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) at the invitation of the party, where he observed similar levels of engagement and inclusiveness.</p>



<p>Such experiences, he noted, demonstrate that Ghana’s democratic culture has benefited from competitive yet participatory politics.</p>



<p>Despite these strengths, Mr Bagbin expressed concern that the political landscape has effectively narrowed to two dominant parties.</p>



<p>“Now, we seem to have only two strong, vibrant, surviving parties,” he stated. “For me, I think we need a third force,” he added, emphasising that expanded political choice could invigorate policy debate and strengthen accountability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ministry of Trade, Agribusiness and Industry has condemned what it described as a terrorist attack that killed eight Ghanaian tomato traders in northern Burkina Faso.</p>



<p>In a press release issued on February 18, the Ministry said it had received “with deep sorrow the tragic news of the killing of Ghanaian tomato traders in a terrorist attack at Titao in Northern Burkina Faso.”</p>



<p>According to the statement, eight Ghanaian nationals were confirmed dead, while others sustained injuries in the attack, which took place in what the Ministry called “a volatile security zone affected by extremist activity.”</p>



<p>The Ministry strongly denounced the incident, describing it as “an act of violence against innocent traders engaged in legitimate commercial activities.”</p>



<p>It said the Government, acting through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration, the Ministry of the Interior and Ghana’s diplomatic mission, is working closely with authorities in Burkina Faso to support those affected.</p>



<p>“Government… is working closely with the authorities in Burkina Faso to ensure that all survivors who have since been evacuated, receive necessary medical care and support,” the statement said.</p>

<p>The Ministry also expressed sympathy to the families of the victims and the wider trading community.</p>



<p>“The Ministry extends its deepest condolences to the bereaved families and the entire trading community,” it stated. “Government stands in solidarity with the victims and bereaved families in these difficult time and remains committed to providing the appropriate assistance.”</p>



<p>The statement added that, in collaboration with national security agencies and regional partners, Government will continue efforts to strengthen cross-border security cooperation and protect Ghanaian traders operating within the sub-region.</p>



<p>It further reassured the public of “Government’s unwavering commitment to protecting Ghanaian businesses and citizens home and abroad.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chief Revenue Officer at the Domestic Tax Revenue Division Free Zones Unit of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), Dominic Adamnor Nartey, says Ghana’s new standard VAT system allows businesses to deduct input taxes and should not automatically lead to higher prices for consumers.</p>



<p>He explained that under the revised VAT Act 2025 (Act 1151), businesses can recover taxes paid on purchases before selling their goods, a change he says corrects misconceptions that the shift to a 20% VAT rate will increase the cost of goods and services.</p>



<p>Speaking on JoyFM’s Super Morning Show on Thursday, February 19, Mr Nartey broke down how the pricing structure works under the new tax regime, contrasting it with the previous 4% flat rate system.</p>



<p>According to him, under the former flat rate scheme, traders were not allowed to deduct input tax from the VAT paid when purchasing goods, forcing them to treat the tax as part of their production cost.</p>



<p>“If you were a flat rate trader before this amendment, you were not entitled to deduct input taxes,” he said. “When you buy from others, you pay VAT, and that VAT becomes part of your cost before you add your margin and charge the 4%.”</p>



<p>He illustrated the process using a hypothetical example, explaining that a trader who buys an item for GH¢100 and pays GH¢15 VAT would add the GH¢15 to the cost before calculating profit and applying the flat rate tax.</p>



<p>However, he said the new standard VAT system changes this approach by allowing businesses to deduct the input tax, preventing it from increasing the final cost of goods.</p>



<p>“Now that you are a standard rate taxpayer, the law allows you to deduct all inputs that you incur in the form of VAT,” he explained. “You don’t add the input tax to your cost. You add your margin to the original cost and then charge the 20%.”</p>



<p>Mr Nartey further clarified that even after charging the 20% VAT, businesses do not pay the full amount to the tax authority but rather remit the net value after deducting the input tax already paid.</p>



<p>“You are not going to pay the entire 20% to GRA. You deduct the input tax you paid and pay the difference,” he stated.</p>



<p>The explanation comes amid public debate following the passage of the VAT Act 2025, which replaced the 4% flat rate with a 20% standard VAT system. The reform has generated concerns among traders and consumers who fear the new rate could increase prices and affect business operations.</p>



<p>But Mr Nartey maintained that when properly applied, the new system removes tax distortions and improves efficiency in Ghana’s tax framework without necessarily raising prices.</p>

<p>The final funeral rites of the late Paramount Chief of the Ziavi Traditional Area, Togbega Kwaku Ayim IV, are gathering momentum as they have entered the second week. </p>



<p>The customary rites, as scheduled to commence on 9th February, 2026, and end on the 1st of March, 2026, continue unabated as women groups under the lead of Queen Mothers took their turn to perform some rites over the last two weeks. These are known as Avihadzidzi and Togbega Didi. </p>



<p><strong>Royal return of Togbega Kwaku Ayim </strong></p>



<p>The actual funeral rites would begin on Friday, 20th February, 2026 when the mortal remains of Togbega will be accompanied to Ziavi-Dzogbe, precisely the Akpevi Clan.</p>



<p>This would include a procession of warriors, Queen, women’s groups, and citizens of Ziavi, sympathizers, and well-wishers, exhibiting the rich Ewe customs and traditions. </p>

<p>The mortal remains of Togbega Kwaku Ayim would be laid in state between Saturday 21st February, 2026 and Saturday 28th February, 2026.</p>



<p>This would enable well-wishers, sympathizers, and others to pay their last respect to the distinguished chief who had contributed to the development of the chieftaincy institution and lasting in some traditional areas in the Volta Region.</p>



<p><strong>Asafo performances </strong></p>



<p>On Saturday, Asogli-Ho warriors would take their turn to perform their Afanyanya rites and pay homage to Togbega Kwaku Ayim IV. About 500 warriors are expected to undertake this very important activity.</p>



<p>Warriors from the Klefe Traditional Area would take their turn on Monday morning for their Asado performance, while Alavanyo Wudidi will perform in the afternoon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The people of Gbi-Peki, would storm the streets of Ziavi in the warregalia to mourn with the chiefs and people of Ziavi on Tuesday. They bring forth the best war fares coupled with the drumming of sacred war drums and their accompanying dances.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Akpinis from Kpando, under the lead of Akpinifiaga, Okpekpewuokpe Dagadu XI, would demonstrate their love to the people of Ziavi as they mourn the demise of Togbega Kwaku Ayim IV.  The late traditional ruler led a committee that brought sanctity to the chiefdom, by adjudicating a tussle of the legitimate successor to the Akpini throne.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The White House has warned Iran would be &#8220;very wise&#8221; to make a deal with the US, amid reports that President Donald Trump is weighing fresh military action against the Islamic Republic.</p>



<p>Press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a news briefing that Trump was still hoping for a diplomatic resolution over Tehran&#8217;s nuclear programme.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1853.png" alt="White House says Iran would be &#039;wise&#039; to make deal, as US ramps up military presence" class="wp-image-10032981800" title="White House says Iran would be &#039;wise&#039; to make deal, as US ramps up military presence" srcset="https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1853.png 1024w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1853-300x169.png 300w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1853-768x432.png 768w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1853-533x300.png 533w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1853-233x131.png 233w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1853-150x84.png 150w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1853-218x123.png 218w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1853-754x424.png 754w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1853-330x186.png 330w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1853-225x127.png 225w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1853-217x122.png 217w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1853-340x191.png 340w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1853-267x150.png 267w, https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-1853-55x31.png 55w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Her comments come as the US moves a second battleship into the region, and a day after progress was reported at US-Iran talks in Switzerland.</p>



<p>US media reported on Wednesday that Trump had discussed attack options with advisers, and that a US strike could take place as early as Saturday. Last summer the US military launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>



<p>Trump had not yet made a final decision about whether to attack and ongoing conversations were described as fluid, sources have told to the BBC&#8217;s US partner CBS News.</p>



<p>Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday there were &#8220;many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran&#8221;.</p>



<p>She referred to US strikes in June, adding: &#8220;Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and with his administration.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although no breakthrough seemed to have emerged from Tuesday&#8217;s indirect talks in Geneva, both sides indicated that there had been steps in the right direction.</p>



<p>Iran said an understanding had been reached with the US on the main &#8220;guiding principles&#8221; that will frame efforts to resolve the dispute around Tehran&#8217;s nuclear programme. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi added that work still needed to be done.</p>



<p>The US said &#8220;progress was made&#8221; and Badr Albusaidi, the foreign minister of Oman, which is mediating the talks, said the negotiations &#8220;concluded with good progress&#8221; on common aims and technical issues.</p>



<p>Asked about the Geneva negotiations, the White House press secretary said that Washington and Tehran were still &#8220;far apart&#8221; on some key issues.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think you heard from the administration and the state department yesterday that there was a little bit of progress made, but we&#8217;re still very far apart on some issues,&#8221; Leavitt said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I believe the Iranians are expected to come back to us with some more detail in the next couple of weeks, and so the president will continue to watch how this plays out.&#8221;</p>



<p>Leavitt declined to say whether Israel would be involved in the US decision.</p>



<p>Earlier in the week, Iran said it had reached an understanding with the US on the main &#8220;guiding principles&#8221; to resolve their dispute over Tehran&#8217;s nuclear programme.</p>



<p>Iran has said it wants to focus discussions on its nuclear programme and the potential lifting of economic sanctions, while Washington indicated previously it wanted Iran&#8217;s missile development to be part of any talks.</p>



<p>The US and its European allies suspect that Iran is moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon, something that Tehran has always denied.</p>



<p>The US has been ramping up its military presence in the waters near Iran, and as satellite images show the Islamic Republic fortifying sensitive military sites.</p>



<p>BBC Verify has confirmed the location of the US aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln &#8211; equipped with guided missile destroyers and dozens of fighter jets &#8211; near Iran.</p>



<p>The US has also reportedly sent the USS Gerald R Ford, the world&#8217;s largest warship, to the Middle East. It is expected to arrive in the region within the next three weeks.</p>



<p>All US military forces deployed to the region were expected to be in place by mid-March, a US official and a senior military official told CBS.</p>



<p>Iran&#8217;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei posted on X on Tuesday an AI-generated image of the Ford at the bottom of the ocean.</p>



<p>&#8220;The US President constantly says that the US has sent a warship toward Iran. Of course, a warship is a dangerous piece of military hardware,&#8221; Khamenei&#8217;s post said.</p>



<p>&#8220;However, more dangerous than that warship is the weapon that can send that warship to the bottom of the sea.&#8221;</p>



<p>Khamenei also accused the US of attempting to predetermine the outcome of negotiations and said that would be a &#8220;wrong and foolish thing to do&#8221;.</p>



<p>Iran&#8217;s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has responded to the US build up by launching a maritime drill in the Strait of Hormuz, located in the Gulf between Oman and Iran, on Monday.</p>



<p>The Strait is considered a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chief Revenue Officer at the Domestic Tax Revenue Division Free Zones Unit of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), Dominic Adamnor Nartey, says the newly passed VAT Act 2025 (Act 1151) will not automatically lead to higher prices of goods and services, despite concerns over the shift from a 4% flat rate to a 20% standard Value Added Tax.</p>



<p>He explained that the new law was introduced to simplify Ghana’s tax system and address long-standing distortions, stressing that price increases attributed to the policy are largely due to business pricing decisions rather than the tax itself.</p>



<p>Speaking on JoyFM’s Super Morning Show on Thursday, February 19, Mr Nartey said the VAT Act 2025 was necessary because Ghana’s VAT framework had become fragmented after years of multiple amendments.</p>



<p>“The Act was brought into existence because the last time we had a comprehensive review of VAT was 2013,” he said. “After that, it suffered a lot of amendments, making the Act fragmented. Act 1151 has come to consolidate all the scattered amendments and simplify the system.”</p>



<p>The new legislation has generated widespread public debate, particularly among traders who argue that the move to a higher standard VAT rate could increase the cost of goods and affect business competitiveness. Some business groups have expressed concern that companies not registered for VAT often charge lower prices, placing VAT-registered traders at a disadvantage.</p>



<p>However, Mr Nartey dismissed claims that the revised tax structure inevitably results in higher prices, insisting that proper pricing methods would prevent such outcomes.</p>



<p>“That is not exactly correct,” he said. “If you build your price according to what the GRA expects you to do, there is no difference.”</p>



<p>He further noted that the Act also seeks to correct tax distortions, including the cascading effect of taxes where multiple layers of taxation raise the final cost of goods. According to him, streamlining the VAT system will improve tax administration, enhance compliance, and make domestic revenue mobilisation more efficient.</p>



<p>The VAT reform forms part of broader government efforts to strengthen Ghana’s revenue base and improve fiscal management, although public discussion continues over its potential impact on businesses and consumers.</p>

<p>A gas explosion has torn through an apartment building in Pakistan’s largest port city of Karachi, killing at least 13 people, including women and children, and injuring several others after part of the structure collapsed, police and rescue officials said.</p>



<p>The explosion happened on Thursday in a residential area of Karachi, the capital of the southern Sindh province, according to local police chief Rizwan Patel.</p>



<p>Rescuers were still removing rubble to search for any survivors trapped under the debris, he said. The search-and-rescue operation was ongoing.</p>



<p>Most houses and apartment buildings in Karachi, like elsewhere in Pakistan, are supplied with natural gas for cooking. However, many households also rely on liquefied petroleum gas cylinders because of low natural gas pressure.</p>



<p>In July, a&nbsp;gas explosion following a wedding reception&nbsp;at a home in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, killed eight people, including the bride and groom. The blast occurred as guests had gathered to celebrate the couple, authorities said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has moved from warnings to enforcement, shutting down 16 food service establishments across the Greater Accra Region on Wednesday, February 18, for operating without valid Food Hygiene Permits.</p>



<p>The action comes exactly two weeks after the Authority issued a public notice stating that, effective February 1, all non-compliant facilities would face immediate closure.</p>



<p>In a statement posted on its official Facebook page, the FDA confirmed it had followed through on that directive.</p>



<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffdaghana%2Fposts%2Fpfbid0uWVpJn1ZqGtFSJSS8zeLcj4jCvQbYTjLqPFKZvfwpbsXeAKfPtJVcQPtqEG4GahWl&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=500" width="500" height="812" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>



<p>Among the 16 establishments closed during the exercise were several well-known spots, including: The Cheesecake House, Dolce Frizzante, Onda, Alora Beach Resort.</p>



<p>“Two weeks after our notice to the public… we have taken action,” the FDA stated. “Today, 16 non-compliant food service establishments in Greater Accra Region… were shut down for failing to meet regulatory requirements.”</p>

<p>The enforcement drive goes beyond upscale restaurants and lounges. The FDA’s directive applies to a wide range of food-related businesses, including: Hotels and event caterers, Traditional “chop bars” and snack bars, Food vans and bakeries, Online food vendors, Canteens in schools, hospitals, and offices.</p>



<p>The Authority said the closures are necessary to protect consumers and maintain standards across the food supply chain.</p>

<p>“We remain committed to protecting public health and ensuring that all food service providers operate in strict compliance with good hygiene practices,” the Authority reaffirmed.</p>



<p>The FDA has urged operators who have not yet regularized their documentation to do so immediately to avoid similar enforcement action.</p>



<p>The affected establishments are expected to remain closed until they meet all regulatory requirements and obtain valid Food Hygiene Permits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>URGENT NEED FOR THE AMENDMENT OF THE ARCHITECTS ACT, 1969 (NLCD 357)</p>



<p>Your Excellency,<br>Your recent visit to the Ministry of Works, Housing and Water Resources (MWHWR), where you<br>received a briefing on the Ministry’s mandate, progress, and challenges, is both timely and welcome.<br>The challenges facing the Ministry and the nation as a whole will benefit from continued engagement<br>and the steady implementation of solutions. At the heart of Ghana’s housing, infrastructure, and urban development challenges lies a deeper problem that is rarely confronted directly.</p>



<p>While most built-environment regulatory frameworks have been updated to reflect modern governance and constitutional standards, the Architects Act, 1969 (NLCD 357), remains frozen in time. Enacted 57 years ago, well before the coming into force of the 1992 Constitution, the law continues to regulate a critical segment of the construction industry despite being outdated and constitutionally vulnerable. It no longer aligns with Ghana’s democratic order, contemporary governance standards, or the realities of the modern professions in the construction sector.</p>



<p>The consequences are real and costly:</p>



<p>Constitutional tensions arising from provisions that compel membership in voluntary<br>associations as a condition for practising a profession, limiting freedom of association. </p>



<p>Weak and undemocratic governance structures that limit accountability and access to justice,</p>



<p>Regulatory blind spots that leave key actors, architectural technologists, draughtsmen, and interior<br>designers, and thousands of first-degree architecture graduates, largely unregulated. </p>



<p>Institutional overlaps that blur the line between regulation and associations undermine public trust.</p>



<p>Your Excellency, Ghana cannot meaningfully address its housing deficit, urban congestion, or infrastructure quality while operating under laws that no longer serve the public interest. The continued postponement of legislative reform in this area is no longer neutral; it is harmful.</p>



<p>We respectfully call for your visit to the Ministry to mark a decisive turning point, with the following steps urgently required: </p>



<p>A clear executive signal for the comprehensive review and reform of the Architects Act, 1969.</p>



<p>A transparent, inclusive stakeholder process led by the Ministry, in collaboration with the Attorney-General and Parliament. </p>



<p>A modern regulatory framework aligned with the 1992 Constitution, democratic governance, and international best practice.<br>This is a moment for leadership, not gradualism. The built environment shapes lives, safety, and economic growth. Ghana cannot afford further delay. </p>



<p>History will remember not the briefing received, but the action taken.</p>

<p>“The declaration of martial law resulted in enormous social costs, and it is difficult to find any indication that the defendant has expressed remorse for that,” Presiding Judge Ji Gwi-yeon told the court on Thursday.</p>



<p>“As to defendant Yoon Suk-yeol, the crime of insurrection leadership is established,” the judge said.</p>



<p>“We sentence Yoon to life imprisonment.”</p>



<p>The Seoul Central District Court ruled that Yoon was the leader of the December 3, 2024 insurrection in a case where prosecutors had sought the death penalty for the disgraced ex-president, who was impeached and removed from office over his declaration of martial law.</p>



<p>The court found that the core fact of Yoon’s martial law case was that he sent the military to the National Assembly in December 2024, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported.</p>

<p>The court also ruled that Yoon intended to prevent and paralyse the National Assembly from functioning properly for a significant period of time, but rejected the special prosecutor’s claim that Yoon planned to establish a long-term dictatorship, according to Yonhap.</p>



<p>Yoon, 65, had maintained his innocence throughout his court appearances, arguing that he had presidential authority to declare martial law and that his decision was aimed at preventing opposition political parties from obstructing the work of government.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Deputy Minister for Food and Agriculture, John Dumelo, has called on Ghanaian youth to take advantage of expanding opportunities within Ghana’s agricultural sector, stressing that farming remains one of the most viable and sustainable business ventures in the country.</p>



<p>Addressing a town hall meeting organised by The Ghanaian Farmer in partnership with the People Building Institute on Saturday, February 14, 2026, at the British Council in Accra, Mr Dumelo emphasised that agriculture must be viewed not merely as subsistence work but as a serious and profitable enterprise.</p>



<p>He noted that government initiatives are increasingly structured to make the sector more attractive to young people, offering access to land, training, improved seedlings, mechanisation services, and financial support schemes.</p>



<p>“The National Youth Authority, Ghana Enterprise Agency, Outgrower Value Chain Fund (OVCF) at the Ministry of Agriculture, have money from donor partners, given to banks to lend to farmers. When you approach them with good plans after starting your farm already, it’s easy to get the loans and grants.”</p>



<p>According to him, young people interested in agriculture can engage with district agricultural offices, register with relevant farmer groups and cooperatives, and participate in government-backed programmes designed to support start-ups and agribusiness expansion.</p>



<p>“The opportunities are there,” he said. “From crop production to livestock, poultry, aquaculture, agro-processing and agritech, there is room for innovation and growth.”</p>



<p>Mr Dumelo underscored the importance of repositioning agriculture as a modern business driven by technology, value addition and strong market linkages.</p>



<p>He encouraged the youth to explore dry season farming and areas such as greenhouse farming, irrigation, digital marketing of farm produce and food processing, which offer higher returns and year-round income potential.</p>



<p>“Dry season farming is the best. Sometimes when I go to the North, the market women prepay for produce before the farmer starts. Once you have your farm close to the water body, acquire a pump and you will make a lot of money,” John Dumelo advised.</p>



<p>He further highlighted that agriculture remains indispensable because of its central role in national food security and economic stability.</p>



<p>“People eat every day,” he stressed. “That alone should tell you that agriculture will always be relevant. It is not a seasonal business; it is a necessity.”</p>



<p>The Deputy Minister urged financial institutions and private sector actors to support young agripreneurs with affordable credit and mentorship, while also encouraging participants to adopt a long-term vision with workable plans when entering the sector.</p>



<p>The town hall meeting assembled farmers, investors and agritech companies along the agriculture value chain in Ghana.</p>



<p>They engaged the Deputy Minister on issues including access to capital, post-harvest losses, market access and climate change resilience.</p>



<p>He discussed available financial packages from state agencies specifically designed for the youth.</p>



<p>While addressing the disappearance of local seeds based on a question from a participant, he said climate change is a major factor.</p>



<p>“That’s why we brought improved seeds to withstand Ghana’s temperature and rainfall patterns. These seeds are not GMO. They’re locally produced for efficiency,” the Deputy Minister added.</p>



<p>Organisers of the program, The Ghanaian Farmer and People Building Institute said the forum formed part of efforts to bridge the gap between policymakers and young farmers, and to inspire more youth to see agriculture as a viable career path to create jobs and reduce unemployment.</p>



<p>They disclosed that the town hall meeting with policy makers will be replicated across the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canine (K9) Unit of the Narcotics Control Commission (NACOC), in collaboration with its Enforcement Unit stationed at Kotoka International Airport (KIA), has intensified behavioural detection operations at the airport.</p>



<p>The move is aimed at reinforcing Ghana’s commitment to combating narcotics trafficking through its primary international gateway, spearheaded by the Commission.</p>



<p>The operation focused on identifying inbound and outbound passengers who displayed behavioural indicators commonly associated with drug trafficking. Officers deployed trained sniffer dogs, advanced scanning equipment, and profiling techniques to support the exercise.</p>



<p>The operation enabled officers to closely monitor passenger movements while ensuring minimal disruption to airport activities.</p>

<p>Although the exercise focused on selected airlines, individuals identified as persons of interest were subjected to further investigation regardless of the airline or flight. This, NACOC said, underscores its non-discriminatory, intelligence-driven approach.</p>



<p>The intelligence-led searches were conducted at strategic locations within the airport, including Aviance, a key ground-handling facility. These targeted checks formed part of a broader security strategy aimed at closing operational gaps often exploited by drug traffickers.</p>



<p>In addition to enforcement activities, officers used the opportunity to educate passengers and airport workers on substance abuse, the dangers of drug trafficking, and the legal consequences of narcotics-related offences. </p>

<p>The visibility of the K9 Unit was deliberately increased to deter potential traffickers and reinforce public confidence in NACOC’s operations.</p>



<p>Throughout the exercise, officers demonstrated professionalism, balancing firmness with respect for passenger rights and aviation security protocols. Searches were conducted using both canine (K9) detection and scanning systems to ensure thorough but efficient screening.</p>



<p>The operation led to the seizure of quantities of pethidine and morphine, both controlled substances under Ghana’s narcotics laws. The seizures highlight the effectiveness of intelligence-led enforcement and canine-assisted searches.</p>

<p>The exercise underscores NACOC’s resolve to strengthen surveillance at ports of entry and exit, disrupt transnational drug trafficking networks, and protect Ghana’s international image. Similar intelligence-driven operations will continue at airports, seaports, and land borders across the country.</p>



<p>NACOC has encouraged the public and industry stakeholders to cooperate with its officers as it intensifies efforts to prevent the use of Ghana’s transport hubs for illicit drug trafficking.</p>

<p>The bond hearing for former Finance Minister Ken Ofori‑Atta in the United States is set to take place today, February 19, 2026, as a federal judge tackles the question of whether Ghanaian authorities have filed proper proof of an extradition request.</p>



<p>Judge David A. Gardey told lawyers handling the former minister’s immigration case that the court “cannot act on assertions without proof”, demanding that documented evidence of an extradition request be submitted <em>by today</em> before he considers any decision on bond or release.</p>



<p>The hearing follows a closed-door court session on January 20, where the judge paused consideration of Ofori-Atta’s bail application after state attorneys opposed his release, citing the pending extradition effort by Ghana.</p>



<p>Mr Ofori-Atta, who served as Finance Minister in the previous New Patriotic Party (NPP) government, has been detained by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) since early January while his immigration status is reviewed. Prosecutors say his visitor visa was revoked, leaving him without a lawful basis to remain in the country.</p>



<p>His lawyers argued in the January hearing that he has cooperated with authorities and is pursuing legal avenues, including an adjustment of status petition that would allow him to remain in the US under current immigration law. </p>



<p>Ghanaian authorities have separately moved to secure his extradition to face those charges, a process that hinges on formal documentation now due before the judge’s ruling. </p>



<p>In a related development, INTERPOL recently removed a Red Notice against Ofori-Atta, a move his lawyers say was based on the notice’s “predominantly political” character.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The governing National Democratic Congress (NDC) has extended heartfelt greetings and best wishes to Muslims in Ghana and across the world as they commence the holy month of Ramadan.</p>



<p>In a statement dated February 19, the party congratulated the Muslim Ummah on the beginning of the sacred period of fasting, prayer and spiritual reflection.</p>



<p>Describing Ramadan as a time of “fasting, prayer, reflection, sacrifice and renewed devotion to Allah,” the NDC said the holy month embodies values that are critical to national development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Executive Director of the Ghana Real Estate Developers Association (GREDA), Samuel Amegayibor, has endorsed the proposal to cap rent advance payments at one year under the government’s new Rent Bill.</p>



<p>Speaking on the ongoing debate over rent reforms, he described the proposed one-year cap as fair, noting that while landlords often require two years’ advance notice and sometimes more, where possible, such requirements place enormous financial pressure on tenants.</p>



<p>“For me, I think the one-year rent advance is fair. Landlords normally take two years’ advance now and more if they have the opportunity. But they have to appreciate the fact that it doesn’t come easy for people to raise those huge funds just to settle rent,” he stated.</p>



<p>Mr Amegayibor stressed that raising large lump-sum payments to cover multiple years of rent is a significant challenge for many Ghanaians, particularly young people just beginning their careers.</p>



<p>“It’s a mutual consideration between parties. If they understand the need to limit or not demand too much at a time, I think it will go a long way to help, especially the young ones who have just started life,” he said.</p>



<p>He explained that when monthly rents running into several thousands of Ghana cedis are multiplied by 12 or even 24 months, the total figure becomes excessively high for most households.</p>



<p>“When you charge several thousand a month, multiplied by 12 and 24 and all that, I think it is a bit on the high side for people,” he added.</p>



<p>His comments come at a time when the government is pushing for reforms under a new Rent Bill to limit rent advances to a maximum of one year, introduce penalties for violations, and strengthen regulation in the rental housing sector.</p>



<p>The proposed reforms have sparked mixed reactions among stakeholders, but Mr Amegayibor’s endorsement signals growing support within the real estate development community for measures to ease tenants&#8217; financial burden while promoting fairness in the housing market.</p>

<p>While you might be familiar with localization and translations when it comes to expanding your small business, what a lot of people get wrong is the fact that it’s far more than just this. </p>



<p>Like, if you want to grow your business online, sure, that means you ship to more places, which makes sense. Plus, that means you market to more places too, but that, at the same time, is where more work happens. </p>



<p>Well, specifically, compliance. While you might be totally compliant selling in the area that you’re living, be it that country, state, region, etc. But that doesn’t inherently mean you’re good to go everywhere, because there’s actually a lot you need to consider before you expand to each new place you want to see. But what exactly?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understand what actually changes when you expand</h2>



<p>Selling into a new place isn’t just “more customers.” It can mean new tax rules, different consumer protection expectations, and sometimes totally different product requirements. </p>



<p>Even inside the US, states don’t play by one shared rulebook on sales tax, and once international orders get involved, VAT or GST and customs steps can show up too. It can be pretty overwhelming, like you’re opening the floodgates, sure, there’s no doubt about that. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tax rules just don’t care </h2>



<p>It&#8217;s super mean to say here, but it really doesn’t matter how small your business is, you’re getting taxed. So, the US will be used in this example because a lot of e-commerce from other countries like to try and eventually reach the US market (and other times Americans love buying from abroad too). </p>



<p>In the US, a big compliance trigger is economic nexus, which is basically when sales into a state cross a threshold that requires registration and collection, even without a physical presence. </p>



<p>And of course you need to also keep in mind that fifferent states have different thresholds, and they can change, so it’s not something to guess on either. That means that <a href="https://www.xero.com/us/guides/california-sales-tax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California sales tax</a> isn’t the same as the taxes in New York aren’t the same either. </p>



<p>When it comes to the EU, there’s taxes there as each country has its own taxing system as well. Sure, it&#8217;s all really overwhelming, and thankfully, thanks to AI and ecommerce software, these things are usually built in for business owners. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Shipping and returns need to match where customers live</h2>



<p>Yeah, this one isn’t all that fun either, but expansion also affects what’s promised at checkout. And of course, this all includes delivery timeframes, duties and import fees, return windows, and refund rules allof which matter more once the customer isn’t local. </p>



<p>If the store is shipping internationally, it helps to be clear about who pays duties and taxes, because customers hate surprise fees, and then support tickets start piling up. And of course, each country, logistic company, and<a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/shipping-carrier?term=&amp;adid=775809778528&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> carrier is going to vary </a>by price and rules, too.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Data privacy and email rules can shift </h2>



<p>Which is really scary, because at any time, all of this can change. Anyways, selling in new regions can also mean different expectations around privacy, cookies, and marketing. </p>



<p>Like email marketing is a good example. What’s normal in one place can require different consent language in another, especially once international customers are in the mix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minority Caucus has also criticised what it describes as inadequate human rights protections in the Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025, cautioning that vague language in the draft law could be used to suppress legitimate civic activity.</p>



<p>The Caucus pointed to provisions framed broadly around protecting against activities intended to undermine the constitutional order.</p>



<p>According to the Minority, without precise definitions, such wording could be interpreted expansively to target lawful opposition, protest or activism.</p>



<p>“Although political neutrality is mentioned, there are no enforcement mechanisms or clear sanctions for breaches,” it stated.</p>



<p>The Minority also warned about the structure of Regional and District Security Councils, which are chaired by Regional Ministers and Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives.</p>



<p>It argued that the absence of cross-party representation creates a risk of politicisation, particularly during election periods.</p>



<p>“During sensitive periods, especially elections, such structures can be misused to suppress lawful political activity,” the Caucus cautioned.</p>



<p>On financial accountability, the Minority maintained that Parliament’s approval of intelligence funding must be matched with structured reporting mechanisms.</p>



<p>It argued that while the Auditor-General audits agency accounts, the Bill does not require detailed budget breakdowns or the publication of non-sensitive audit findings to enable effective oversight.</p>



<p>“Ghana needs a security framework that is strong and professional, but also accountable and firmly anchored in the Constitution,” the Minority stressed, reiterating its position that the Bill must be amended to safeguard civil liberties while strengthening national security.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Two persons have been confirmed dead, while 14 others sustained injuries following a road accident on the Ho–Aflao Highway in the Volta Region.</p>



<p>The crash occurred when a Ford Transit vehicle with registration number VR-322-20 collided with a Honda Civic, registration number GN-1166-16.</p>



<p>Preliminary information indicates that the Ford Transit, which was transporting passengers, crashed into the saloon car while attempting to overtake another vehicle.</p>

<p>The impact left several occupants trapped in the wreckage, prompting an emergency response.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nasara Wing is a special wing within the Party.</p>



<p>Just like the Youth and Women’s wings, It is a “special tool designed” to uniquely recruit Zangos, retain and work with them to ensure they understand who we truly are as a Party; and not the propaganda they are CONSTANTLY fed with by the NDC.</p>



<p>Part of its role as a wing is to connect the Zangos with NPP and to promote the policies and programmes of the party in the Zango Communities in Ghana and abroad.</p>



<p>Note that, our External Branches also have NASARA Coordinators, now Nasara Organisers.</p>



<p>The establishment of the wing is to make certain the party is active and visible in the Zango Communities to gain the trust and confidence of the Zango people and to encourage them to join the Party.</p>



<p>Article 15 clause 5 (b) of the NPP Constitution spells out the responsibilities of the Nasara Wing of the Party.</p>



<p>It is a good read. All aspiring Nasara Organisers should read it and determine whether or not they are suitable for this strategic role.</p>



<p>Tactically, it will be wrong for non-Zango members of the Party to contest for the Nasara Organiser. The Nasara Organiser should be an identifiable Zango; who can easily connect with his people, who understands their culture and tradition, speak the commonly spoken language (Hausa) correctly and can articulate the policies of our party and topical issues without ambiguity.</p>



<p>Even the kind of costume</p>



<p>worn represents a specific Zango character and cultural style. A Nasara Organiser must exemplify a typical ZANGO person.</p>



<p>In constituencies where we do not have Zango communities, members of the party from the minority tribes should be considered for the Nasara Organiser. This motivate the minority to identify with us.</p>



<p>Let me illustrate.</p>



<p>In the Mion Constituency, we have very few Zangos scattered in the constituency. They are Fulanis. Dagbamba are the majority tribe. Konkombas appear to be as large as Dagbamba. Fulanis are settlers across the constituency.</p>



<p>It will be strategically prudent to encourage and support a Fulani member of the Party to become the Nasara Organiser.</p>



<p>The election of a Dagbana or Konkomba as Nasara Organiser in a Dagbamba/Konkomba dominated constituency such as Mion will be counter productive.</p>



<p>Zangos are migrants from Northern Nigeria, Mali, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Niger, Guinea, etc. They migrated to Ghana for trading purposes. Regardless of the diversity of their backgrounds, they still find it necessary to cultivate a sense of unity and solidarity among themselves. They are mainly Muslims and use the Hausa language as their lingua franca.</p>



<p>Some Zango groups/tribes living permanently in Ghana majority of whom are now Ghanaians citizens, are Hausas, Fulanis, Wangaras, Mandes, Bissas, Ligbi, Nafana, Banda, Mosshis, Zabramas, Kotokolis, etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minority Caucus has described the surveillance and warrant provisions in the Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025, as “deeply troubling”, warning that they risk undermining privacy rights and civil liberties.</p>



<p>Addressing Parliament during debate on the Committee’s report, the Minority cautioned that applications to intercept communications under the Bill could be made not only to a Superior Court judge but also to a senior police officer.</p>



<p>“Administrative authorisation for such intrusive powers undermines the principle that only a court should approve invasions of privacy,” the Caucus stated.</p>



<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dDWlwZ9M3qR4UMVPNZYM-mMEn3-k2udK/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>



<p>The Minority further criticised the provision for broad warrants that may apply to a class of persons and last up to sixty days.</p>



<p>According to the Caucus, the Bill does not require authorities to notify affected persons after surveillance ends, nor does it mandate periodic review of the necessity of surveillance or the destruction of irrelevant data.</p>



<p>The Caucus also raised concerns about restrictions on parliamentary scrutiny, noting that security officers could refuse to produce documents before Parliament if the Speaker certifies disclosure as prejudicial to national security.</p>



<p>“There is no requirement to provide reasons or even redacted versions,” it pointed out, adding that the Bill imposes criminal sanctions of five to ten years for certain disclosures without explicitly protecting whistleblowers.</p>



<p>“National security and civil liberty are not opposing goals. We can protect our nation without eroding the freedoms of our people,” the Minority stressed, calling for judicial-only warrant authorisation and stronger whistleblower protections.,</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minority Caucus has warned that the proposed Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025 could open the door to politicisation and weaken financial transparency within Ghana’s intelligence framework.</p>



<p>It argued that the structure of Regional and District Security Councils, chaired by Regional Ministers and Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs), creates risks during politically sensitive periods.</p>



<p>“During sensitive periods, especially elections, such structures can be misused to suppress lawful political activity,” the Caucus cautioned, noting the absence of cross-party representation requirements.</p>



<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dDWlwZ9M3qR4UMVPNZYM-mMEn3-k2udK/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>



<p>The Minority further criticised what it described as insufficient human rights safeguards in the Bill. It said broad phrases such as protecting against activities intended to undermine the constitutional order could be interpreted to target legitimate opposition, protest or civic activism.</p>



<p>“Although political neutrality is mentioned, there are no enforcement mechanisms or clear sanctions for breaches,” it observed.</p>



<p>On financial accountability, the Minority noted that while Parliament approves funding for intelligence agencies and the Auditor-General audits their accounts, the Bill does not require detailed budget breakdowns or structured reporting to enable effective scrutiny.</p>



<p>It also highlighted the absence of obligations to publish non-sensitive audit findings or provide structured briefings to relevant parliamentary committees.</p>



<p>“Ghana needs a security framework that is strong and professional, but also accountable and firmly anchored in the Constitution,” the Minority concluded. “Parliament must get this balance right.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ministry of Local Government, Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs has announced plans to develop a Digital Registry System to serve as a central platform for churches to update their operational status annually.</p>



<p>Ahmed Ibrahim, the sector Minister, disclosed this in Parliament on Wednesday in response to a question from Prof. Kingsley Nyarko, Member of Parliament for Kwadaso, regarding the status of registered churches in the country.</p>



<p>He explained that the Ministry would establish a data-sharing agreement with the Office of the Registrar of Companies (ORC) to access records of churches registered as companies limited by guarantee.</p>



<p>The initiative, he said, would be carried out in collaboration with the ORC and the Ministry of Justice.</p>



<p>Additionally, Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies (MMDAs) would maintain local registers of churches operating within their jurisdictions as part of the local governance structure.</p>



<p>These registers, Mr Ibrahim noted, would eventually be linked to the central digital system to ensure accurate and up-to-date information on churches nationwide.</p>



<p>Responding to questions on the number of churches in the country, Mr Ibrahim said that although the ORC did not publish a single national figure, regional data and surveys revealed thousands of churches across Ghana.</p>



<p>In the Greater Accra Region alone, more than 2,200 churches had been registered, with about 98 per cent owned by individuals.</p>



<p>He recalled that the Religious Bodies (Regulation) Law, 1989 (PNDC Law 221), was originally intended to regulate the establishment of churches and religious bodies but faced opposition from many groups who argued that it infringed on religious freedom and gave government excessive control over religious practice.</p>



<p>“Today, churches are registered as companies limited by guarantee with the Office of the Registrar of Companies. This gives them legal recognition, the ability to own property, and protection under Ghanaian law,” Mr Ibrahim said.</p>



<p>He added that the new digital registry would provide a reliable mechanism for tracking the operational status of churches, thereby enhancing transparency and governance in the religious sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Minority in Parliament has criticised the proposed Security and Intelligence Agencies Bill, 2025, describing it as overly centralising power in the Presidency and lacking adequate safeguards.</p>



<p>In a press statement issued on Wednesday, February 18, the Minority Leader, Alexander Afenyo-Markin, said that although the Minority supports reforms to Ghana’s national security architecture, the current draft of the Bill is “deeply flawed”.</p>



<p>“Let me be clear. The Minority Caucus supports the need to reform Ghana’s national security architecture. Our country requires a modern, efficient and professional intelligence system that protects citizens and safeguards our constitutional order,” he stated.</p>



<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dDWlwZ9M3qR4UMVPNZYM-mMEn3-k2udK/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>



<p>However, he warned that the Bill concentrates excessive appointing authority in the hands of the President, including the power to appoint the National Security Coordinator and Directors-General of intelligence agencies without parliamentary vetting.</p>



<p>“These offices control agencies with coercive powers and access to sensitive national data. It is unacceptable that they operate without legislative scrutiny,” he argued.</p>



<p>Mr Afenyo-Markin further raised concerns about what he described as weak oversight mechanisms dominated by the Executive.</p>



<p>According to him, the National Security Council, chaired by the President, effectively becomes the governing body of the intelligence agencies, amounting to “self-oversight.”</p>



<p>He also criticised the absence of an independent inspector-style body with proactive investigative powers.</p>



<p>“For these reasons, we cannot support the Bill in its present form,” he declared, urging Parliament to insert independent oversight mechanisms to ensure that national security operations remain accountable and constitutionally grounded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Associate Professor of Finance at Andrews University, Prof. William Kwasi Peprah, says the Bank of Ghana is set to exit financing for the gold trade, a development he believes will increase pressure on the operational and funding model of the proposed Gold Board.</p>



<p>Speaking on Joy News’ PM Express on Wednesday, Prof Peprah described the Gold Board concept as “very good,” but cautioned that the financing structure must be tightened quickly to prevent the new arrangement from sliding into the kind of challenges currently associated with COCOBOD.</p>



<p>“The financing model for Gold Board also needs to be looked at a little bit,” he said, warning that the institution has already faced difficulties accessing promised government funding.</p>



<p>He noted that the Gold Board has relied on support from the Government of Ghana, but “the amount they promised were not fully released in 2025,” and with “Bank of Ghana… going to exit in financing gold trade,” the new structure will have to find alternative ways to stay afloat.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said the law establishing the Gold Board provides an option that should now be explored more seriously. “In the law, it allows them to take money in advance from whoever needs gold, and then be able to give them the gold,” he explained, adding that the model must be examined carefully to ensure sustainability.</p>



<p>He also advocated for Ghana to establish a gold stabilisation account, similar to those already in place for cocoa and petroleum. </p>



<iframe width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mSCZdNE0E_o?si=adO3gewCnJNKrb8T" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>“If the Gold Board will work, we need another stabilisation account for the gold,” he stressed.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah said Ghana must not treat the current rise in gold prices as permanent. </p>



<p>He explained that gold is largely driven by three factors: fear, inflation, and currency hedging. He pointed to growing global uncertainty as a major reason prices have surged.</p>



<p>“We currently have fear… so many things happening in the world, which makes investors uncertain. So that is why we are seeing the gold price really, really moving up,” he said.</p>



<p>He added that while inflation projections from the IMF and the World Bank are expected to moderate, the weakening of the US dollar has also prompted investors to turn to gold. “We’ve noticed that the US dollar is devaluing, and that’s why we see investors moving into gold,” he noted.</p>



<p>With Ghana benefiting from what he described as a “windfall,” Prof Peprah urged authorities to prepare for the possibility of falling prices.</p>



<p>“Now that we are having this windfall, we should be able to establish another stabilisation fund purposely for gold… to guard against initial [shocks] that will come in,” he said.</p>



<p>He warned that without a stabilisation buffer, Ghana could face serious trouble if gold prices decline. “If the price starts to drop, it’s not really going to affect the economy,” he said, explaining that the stabilisation fund would protect the industry and provide support when needed.</p>



<p>He also drew a clear distinction between a revolving fund and a stabilisation fund. “They have a revolving fund. Revolving fund account is not the same as stabilisation fund account,” he said.</p>



<p>Prof Peprah concluded that Ghana must build a long-term safety net around gold revenues, warning that if the country fails to plan properly, “our trade balance will move into a very struggling position.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ghana Accountability Forum (GAF) called for a forensic audit into the finances of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), as the nation’s cocoa sector undergoes structural reforms.</p>



<p>In that regard, the forum called on the government to set up an independent committee that would publish its findings to strengthen public sector transparency and accountability.</p>



<p>The GAF is a non-partisan platform that brings together civil society organizations (CSOs), anti-corruption advocates, media practitioners, youth activists, and concerned citizens to collectively demand accountability in public life.</p>



<p>It serves as a safe and credible space for dialogue, advocacy, research, and citizen engagement focusing on anti-corruption advocacy, public financial accountability, social accountability, access to information, media freedom, and whistleblower protection.</p>



<p>A statement issued and signed by Mr Raphael Godlove Ahenu, the Interim Chairman of the GAF said parliamentary oversight over the management of the COCOBOD ought to be strengthened too.</p>



<p>“In fact, accountability should not be politicized but rather seen as a national responsibility to safeguard Ghana’s most iconic agricultural sector,” a copy of the statement made available to the Ghana News Agency (GNA) stated.</p>



<p>It observed that a comprehensive investigation into the operations of the COCOBOD was required to hold authorities accountable, as the nation reformed her cocoa sector.</p>



<p>The statement indicated that: “The scale of financial strain, declining cocoa output, and growing concerns among farmers demand urgent scrutiny of management decisions, financial commitments, and governance practices within COCOBOD”.</p>



<p>It said “The current situation within the cocoa sector raises serious questions about oversight, accountability, and long-term sustainability.</p>



<p>A thorough investigation is necessary to establish the facts and protect the national interest”, saying that: “Reports suggest that the COCOBOD’s debt burden has increased significantly”.</p>



<p>It said the sharp decline in the nation’s annual cocoa production could have far-reaching consequences on rural livelihoods and the broader economy, citing factors like illegal mining, ageing cocoa farms, plant diseases, and inadequate support systems for farmers as major contributors.</p>



<p>The statement added that: “Cocoa is central to Ghana’s economy and identity and that calls for courage, transparency, and reforms, placing accountability at the heart of the sector governance structure.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Africa’s Global Bank, United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc, has unveiled a diaspora banking and investment platform designed to serve Africans living and working across the world and within the continent.</p>



<p>The platform, launched in collaboration with leading ecosystem partners including United Capital, Africa Prudential, UBA Pensions, Afriland Properties, Heirs Insurance Group, and Avon Healthcare Limited, represents a major step in redefining diaspora banking beyond remittances toward structured wealth creation and long-term investment.</p>



<p>At the unveiling, which took place at UBA’s global headquarters in Lagos under the theme: “Beyond Banking: Powering the Global African Lifestyle, all the company representatives were on hand to showcase a seamless platform that goes beyond remittances, wealth creation, protection, and long-term prosperity.</p>



<p>Speaking at the event, UBA’s Head of Diaspora Banking, Anant Rao, described the initiative as a strategic shift in how Africa engages its global citizens.</p>



<p>“For decades, Africa’s engagement with its diaspora has focused largely on remittances. Today, we are moving beyond that. This platform represents a transition from simple money transfers to a financial ecosystem where Africans globally can bank, make payments, invest, protect their families, and build long-term wealth seamlessly,” he said.</p>

<p>Rao noted that African diaspora remittance flows exceed $100 billion annually, making them one of the most resilient and consistent sources of capital into the continent.</p>



<p>“Diaspora capital is not just a flow of funds — it is a strategic growth partner for Africa.<br>Our role is to provide a trusted platform that converts capital into structured investment and shared prosperity across the continent.”</p>



<p>The objective is to provide a platform that brings together offerings to address the diverse needs of the Global African, including Banking and payments, Investments, securities services, asset management, Insurance, Pensions, and real estate.</p>



<p>Through this coordinated ecosystem, diaspora customers can access financial solutions across multiple sectors through a single trusted platform, enabling them to manage their financial lives and family commitments across borders with ease and transparency.</p>



<p>UBA’s Group Head, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Alero Ladipo, emphasised the importance of collaboration in delivering a seamless diaspora experience.</p>



<p>“The modern African is a global citizen — mobile, ambitious, and deeply connected to home. Whether living in Africa, Europe, the Americas, or the Middle East, there must be a structured and secure financial connection to your home country. </p>



<p>&#8220;This platform ensures that Africans everywhere can remain economically connected to the continent with confidence and transparency.”</p>



<p>Partners within the ecosystem highlighted growing demand among diaspora Africans for structured investment opportunities, secure property ownership, insurance protection, and long-term financial planning.</p>



<p>United Capital showcased globally accessible investment products designed to deliver professionally managed, transparent wealth-creation opportunities.</p>



<p>Afriland Properties emphasised structured and well-governed real estate investment pathways for diaspora clients.</p>



<p>Heirs Insurance highlighted protection solutions for life and assets, while Avon Healthcare Limited demonstrated healthcare access and cross-border insurance solutions for families.</p>



<p>Africa Prudential and UBA Pension reinforced digital investment management and long-term pension savings solutions designed to support diaspora participation in African capital markets.</p>



<p>Together, the partners underscored a shared commitment to providing diaspora Africans with credible, transparent, and professionally managed financial pathways.</p>

<p>Rao also reiterated the guiding philosophy of Africapitalism, championed by UBA’s Founder and Chairman, Tony O. Elumelu, CFR.</p>



<p>He explained that Africapitalism is the belief that Africa’s private sector must play a leading role in the continent’s development by making long-term investments that generate both economic returns and social impact.</p>



<p>As Africa continues to position itself as one of the world’s most dynamic growth frontiers, UBA believes mobilising diaspora capital through trusted financial institutions will be central to shaping the continent’s next phase of development.</p>



<p>“Africa will increasingly be financed by Africans themselves, including Africans abroad,” Rao added.<br>“Our responsibility is to build the trusted financial infrastructure that makes this possible.”</p>



<p>“When Africa’s global citizens invest back into Africa, growth becomes inevitable,” he concluded.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last week, eight Ghanaian traders were gruesomely killed and several others wounded when insurgents ambushed a community in Burkina Faso where they had travelled to buy tomatoes and other foodstuffs.</p>



<p>Ghana and Burkina Faso share a border and those of us from the Upper East know how closely knitted the border communities are. Citizens of both countries cross over on a daily basis for both business and family issues.</p>



<p>The traders’ trip there last week was, therefore, one of a routine governed by the decades-old trade relations between two African neighbours. In this case, it was simply to cross the border, access produce that Ghana does not currently have and return to sustain their livelihoods and feed the market back home.</p>



<p>But as fate would have it, that journey ended in blood, depriving families of loved ones and breadwinners. Indeed, similar journeys have resulted in deaths, but mostly from road crashes.</p>



<p>Rather than limit it to the typical Sahelian insurgency that it has always been, we must see this incident as a mirror held up to us, Ghanaians. When properly examined, the incident reveals the deeper consequences of our failure to deliver on the very policies that were supposed to make such journeys unnecessary.</p>



<p>While we do not know the details, the media reports from government officials showed that our compatriots, the food traders, risked their lives in conflict zones to cart foodstuffs, including tomatoes, which the nation lacks now.</p>



<p>This begs the question: what has become of the myriads of agricultural promises and investments that were announced and implemented in recent years?</p>



<p><strong>Human cost of failed agric policies</strong></p>



<p>Every November, Ghana’s dry season arrives with its annual certainty, starting with extreme cold and dryness before graduating to unbearable heat and dust. But unlike other countries that plan for such predictable cycles, we enter this period with agricultural scarcity that forces traders to look beyond our borders. It has been so since I was a child, growing up in the dusty footpaths of Bongo in the Upper East Region.</p>



<p>And while that happened, Ghana implemented a series of agricultural policies, which we proudly announced, funded, launched with fanfare but later abandoned.</p>



<p>Now, as we mourn our mothers, sisters and loved ones, it refreshes the painful question: What became of the many laudable initiatives designed to guarantee food security, especially in the dry season?</p>



<p>This brings back memories of the famous One Village, One Dam and the Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) policies and the nearly $1 billion Pwalugu Multipurpose Dam project that were once touted as game changers only to fizzle out, leaving behind scars of debts for the country.</p>



<p>In the case of the One Village, One Dam, it was touted as the solution to northern Ghana’s water and irrigation challenges. For those aware of the agricultural potential of the north, this sounded like the final solution but as is now common knowledge, the policy produced many dams that turned out to be dugouts, incapable of supporting even backyard farming during the harsh perennial harmattan.</p>



<p>Multiple media reports showed that in many communities, the dams dried up before the dry season even peaked.</p>



<p>Billions of cedis were also pumped into PFJ across the two phases, yet the structure of the programme, which was heavy on subsidies but weak on irrigation, mechanisation and market linkages, meant that the country remains vulnerable to seasonal shortages. Reported bumper harvests in plantain and other produce were not sustained, pushing us back on the cycle of scarcity.</p>



<p>Today, despite PFJ’s massive expenditure, Ghana cannot produce tomatoes consistently year-round, resulting in our traders continuing the perilous journey to Burkina Faso, leading to the deadly ambush.</p>



<p>Then comes the Pwalugu Dam. It was branded as the “game changer” and envisioned to provide irrigation for thousands of hectares, stabilise northern sector’s power supply, and unlock agro-industrial potential.</p>



<p>Years later, the site remains untouched by meaningful progress. There is no reservoir, no turbines, no irrigation canals and so no impact yet a huge debt has been incurred and borne by Mother Ghana.</p>



<p>Beyond these, numerous pilot projects, demonstration farms, mechanisation centres and irrigation schemes consumed resources and headlines but delivered little in sustained agricultural transformation, confirming our challenges with execution.</p>



<p>The painful truth</p>



<p>Analysing these lead to one painful conclusion – if these policies were properly executed to success, these perilous journeys would have been needless and our mothers might have just been saved.</p>



<p>If One Village, One Dam had delivered functional irrigation, farmers in Northern Ghana could be producing tomatoes now. If PFJ had strengthened irrigation and agro-processing value chains instead of focusing narrowly on input distribution, we could have a stable year-round supply. If the Pwalugu Dam existed today, Ghana would be exporting vegetables, not importing from conflict zones.</p>



<p>Indeed, our traders were in Burkina Faso because domestic systems failed their customers and they had to go through conflict zones in search of foodstuffs.</p>



<p>This is why we must now embrace this painful moment as a rallying point to not repeat our mistakes. Ghana doesn’t need dugouts nor rhetoric.</p>



<p>The country’s farmers need professionally engineered, climate resilient irrigation systems capable of supporting commercial agriculture.</p>



<p>The Pwalugu Dam cannot be left as a phantom project. Every abandoned or underperforming agricultural initiative must be audited, explained, and either revived or reprogrammed.</p>



<p>Food security is a national priority. When people must travel to conflict zones for tomatoes, it raises genuine questions about the state of the country’s food supply, and national security must be involved.</p>



<p>I am particularly happy that the matter has gotten the attention of President John Mahama and I am hopeful that he will ride on it to execute impactful policies.</p>



<p>There is no belabouring the point that the future lies in empowering commercial farmers, of which the president is one. Agri-processors, and investors need support, not solely from government-run programmes but also the private-sector and development institutions, including the World Bank and the African Development Bank.</p>



<p>We must create the environment for sustainable private-sector driven irrigation, mechanisation, and value chain growth.</p>



<p>Thus, while we mourn the deceased, I am hopeful that we will honour them by refusing to repeat the cycle of policies without implementation, by demanding seriousness in agricultural planning, by insisting that food security is a national non-negotiable.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Ghana has the capacity, the land, the people, and the ideas. And we have a President who has shown that he can mobilise the country’s resources to achieve the best for its today and tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Johnson Asiedu Nketia, the National Chairman of the ruling National Democratic Congress (NDC) has reiterated calls on supporters of the party to unite and embrace peace to help retain the party in government.</p>



<p>The National Chairman said unity was a process that required collective efforts to consolidate the grassroots and pave the way for continued good governance, enabling Ghanaians to enjoy better lives.</p>



<p>Mr Asiedu Nketia made the call when he addressed supporters of the party in Agona West and East as part of his ‘thank you’ tour at Agona Swedru.</p>



<p>The National Chairman was accompanied by Ekow Okyere Panyin Aduamoah, the Central Regional Minister; Richard Asiedu, the Central Regional Chairman of the party; MMDCEs; and other top officials of the NDC.</p>



<p>He said the tour of the Central region was a campaign promise given to the chiefs, the clergy, opinion leaders, floating voters and many others during the 2024 Presidential and Parliamentary elections.</p>



<p>Mr Asiedu Nketia further admonished the party&#8217;s supporters not to take the electoral victory lightly, particularly in Agona West, where for many years the NDC had not won such a massive vote, adding that the opponent was also seriously adopting strategies to reorganise itself to come out strongly in 2028.</p>



<p>He said Ghanaians were witnessing good governance under President Mahama, and that his promise to appoint only 60 Ministers if he won the elections had been fulfilled to avoid draining the economy, unlike the New Patriotic Party, which appointed 125 ministers.</p>



<p>Mr Asiedu Nketia urged party members seeking jobs to exercise restraint, noting that not all four million NDC members could be appointed as Ministers.</p>



<p>He expressed gratitude to the chiefs, the Queen mothers, and all for their support and prayers, which helped the NDC win the elections, and pledged to reconstruct roads in the Agona Swedru enclave to facilitate the free movement of goods and services.</p>



<p>Mr Eric Gyamfi Odoom, the Agona West Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), said President Mahama’s reset agenda had reflected in the lives of the people in the Municipality in the areas of education, health, potable water, job creation and reshaping of feeder roads to improve the quality of life of the people.</p>



<p>He said it was unprecedented that 10 million Ghana cedis was received from the government under the District Assembly Common Fund as part of President Mahama’s reset agenda.</p>



<p>He said the substantial amount released by the Common Fund administrator had enabled the Assembly to undertake many development projects, including school blocks, health facilities, and potable water.</p>



<p>Nana Kweku Esieni V, the Regent of Agona Swedru, appealed to the National Chairman to use his good offices to help with the construction of the Swedru/Winneba-Junction Road, the Swedru /Akim Oda Road, and the Swedru/Ajumako-Enyan-Essiam District Road to improve the transportation of goods and services.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Government’s skills development and training programme is to create sustainable employment opportunities and improve the incomes of young people, especially women and vulnerable groups.</p>



<p>Alhaji Mohammed Muntaka Mubarak, Minister for the Interior, who said this, explained that equipping young people with the requisite employability skills and mindset was the surest way to reduce the country’s unemployment.</p>



<p>Alhaji Muntaka Mubarak, who is also the Member of Parliament (MP) for Asawase, was speaking at the graduation ceremony and the distribution of startup kits to 242 young people trained under the National Apprenticeship Programme in Asawase, Asokore-Mampong Municipality.</p>



<p>The training programme is a collaboration between the Ghana Enterprises Agency and the Mastercard Foundation.</p>



<p>They were trained in fruit juice processing, catfish aquaculture, and livestock production. ‎</p>



<p>Muntaka Mubarak noted that the initiative, rooted in the NDC&#8217;s 2024 manifesto, aimed to combat youth unemployment by promoting vocational skills.‎</p>



<p>It also strives to ensure that young men and women, including individuals with disabilities, receive certification, startup support, and pathways to self-employment.‎</p>



<p>According to the MP, the overarching goal was to provide employment and income opportunities for 250,000 youth aged 15-35 nationwide, with 70% women and 10% persons with disabilities.‎</p>



<p>He underscored that, the government was committed to creating diverse opportunities that alleviated poverty, enhance food security, and stimulate local industries.‎</p>



<p>Alhaji Muntaka noted that the government was prepared to monitor progress, tackle challenges, and amplify successes to ensure that every corner of Ghana, including the Asawase constituency, benefited from these initiatives.‎</p>



<p>He explained that the programme was revolutionary in its inclusivity and practicality, partnering with master craftsmen to facilitate training in authentic workshops and on genuine projects.</p>



<p>Apprentices, he said, not only acquired technical skills but also participated in entrepreneurship modules and business management training, and received certification recognised by national authorities.</p>



<p>He noted that quotas had been established to ensure meaningful participation by women, who often face additional barriers, and that provisions had been made to support them.‎</p>



<p>The NDC government was also exploring synergies with other programs, such as Adwumawura and skills partnerships with institutions like the Ghana National Fire Service, to expand opportunities, he stated.‎</p>



<p>Muntaka Mubarak appealed to traditional leaders, the Council of Ulamas, the Christian Council, and the Sarkin Zongo to continue providing guidance and moral support to young entrepreneurs.</p>



<p>“Let this ceremony inspire us all to strive harder, support one another, and construct the prosperous Ghana we all deserve, one skilled youth, one thriving business, one empowered community at a time,” he stated.‎</p>



<p>He also urged the youth not to let doubt or adversity deter them, asserting that with determination, government support, and the blessings of Almighty Allah, they would undoubtedly succeed.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Plan International Ghana has urged journalists to move beyond sensational headlines and political propaganda and embrace responsible, rights-based reporting on children, girls and vulnerable communities.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Plan International Ghana has urged journalists to move beyond sensational headlines and political propaganda and embrace responsible, rights-based reporting on children, girls and vulnerable communities.</p>



<p>At the opening of a three-day media training on gender and children in Koforidua on Monday, Mr Eric Ayaba, the Head of Programmes and Influencing at Plan International Ghana, said although there were countless untold stories about children and girls across the country, many media practitioners often prioritised political and sensational narratives over development and rights issues.</p>



<p>It was on the theme: “Journalism with Purpose: Reporting Responsibly on Children, Gender, Equity and Vulnerable Communities,” held at the Eastern Premier Hotel in Koforidua.</p>



<p>“Telling the story of children and girls is in itself a development issue. It is also an issue of rights for people to know,” he said.</p>



<p>He expressed concern over reportage that perpetuated stereotyping and victim-blaming, particularly in cases of sexual and gender-based violence.</p>



<p>“The moment you begin to blame the victim, you are almost cutting off the most important information needed to tell the truth about the story,” Mr Ayaba stated.</p>



<p>He urged journalists to uphold the “do no harm” principle, stressing that reportage must not endanger or retraumatise children and vulnerable persons.</p>



<p>Mr Ayaba underscored the importance of informed and ongoing consent, noting that consent could be withdrawn at any time. He emphasised safeguarding anonymity to protect sources from further harm.</p>



<p>“As journalists, you are the bridge between reality and public perception. The goal is not just to be better reporters, but responsible reporters,” he said, adding that professional competence must go hand in hand with ethical responsibility.</p>



<p>He noted that Plan International Ghana had, over the past three years, consistently engaged the media to build capacity in gender-transformative reporting and would continue to invest in the partnership if it yielded measurable outcomes.</p>



<p>Plan International, founded in 1937, is a global humanitarian and development organisation working to advance children’s rights and equality for girls.</p>



<p>In Ghana, the organisation implements programmes focused on education, child protection, youth empowerment, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and gender equality.</p>



<p>Its collaboration with the media forms part of a broader influencing strategy to shape public discourse and policies affecting children and marginalised groups.</p>



<p>Ms Theodora Asare, Project Manager of the Renewed Women’s Voice and Leadership (RWVL) Ghana Project, highlighted structural inequalities and limited access to resources as persistent barriers to gender equality.</p>



<p>She said the project, funded by Global Affairs Canada with support from Plan International Canada, aimed to strengthen the capacity of 120 local, regional and national women’s rights organisations, youth-led groups and human rights defenders between March 2025 and December 2031.</p>



<p>With an allocation of about 1.9 million dollars, more than half of which would go directly to grantees, the project would provide flexible funding, advocacy support and research-based interventions to drive legal and social change.</p>



<p>“We want to enhance organisational sustainability. If your organisation is not properly structured, you cannot mobilise resources to serve women and girls,” Ms Asare said.</p>



<p>The project is being implemented in partnership with the Network for Human Rights in Ghana and AfriYan Ghana to support both established and emerging organisations, particularly those representing structurally excluded groups.</p>



<p>Ms Asare noted that strengthening feminist and intersectional approaches, promoting transparency and accountability, and investing in collective care and well-being were central to the initiative.</p>



<p>She emphasised the media’s role in amplifying research findings and policy advocacy efforts, stating that evidence-based reporting was critical to advancing gender equality and influencing reforms.</p>



<p>Ms Regina Asamoah, an award-winning journalist and communications specialist, highlighted practical safeguarding measures, including disabling geolocation features on mobile devices when covering sensitive stories in communities.</p>



<p>She advised journalists to obtain consent before taking photographs or videos and to use inclusive language, replacing terms such as “beneficiaries” with “participants” to avoid reinforcing top-down narratives.</p>



<p>Ms Asamoah also outlined several ongoing initiatives under Plan International Ghana, including education, digital skills, youth empowerment and humanitarian interventions, urging journalists to explore development-focused angles in their coverage.</p>



<p>The training forms part of Plan International Ghana’s broader commitment to promoting ethical journalism that prioritising dignity over headlines, safety over hate and development over propaganda.</p>



<p>Participants are expected to leave the workshop with strengthened skills in gender-transformative reporting, safeguarding and rights-based storytelling to ensure media coverage contributed positively to national development and the protection of children and vulnerable populations.</p>

<p>The Minister of Roads and Highways, Governs Kwame Agbodza, has attributed the current financial challenges facing the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) to the awarding of cocoa road contracts valued at GH¢23 billion during the 2023/2024 fiscal year.</p>



<p>He explained that the sheer magnitude of the contracts compelled COCOBOD to channel significant funds into procuring construction materials, which adversely affected the institution’s financial standing.</p>



<p>Mr. Agbodza made the remarks in Parliament on Wednesday while responding to questions on the government’s value-for-money analysis and the status of the cocoa roads programme.</p>



<p>The Minister noted that the suspension of cocoa road projects in 2017 had adversely affected cocoa-growing communities, resulting in deteriorating road networks, halted contracts, disruptions to the cocoa value chain, and hardships for farmers.</p>



<p>“In view of these challenges, the government has ceded all cocoa road projects to the Ministry of Roads and Highways, particularly the Urban and Feeder Roads Departments,” he stated.</p>



<p>There were 266 cocoa road contracts awarded, stressing the need for a comprehensive review of the programme to ensure efficiency and sustainability, Mr Agbodza stated.</p>

<p>Johnson Asiedu Nketia, Chairman of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), has urged cocoa farmers in Ghana to hold the previous government accountable for the ongoing cocoa crisis, which has led to falling cocoa prices.</p>



<p>President John Mahama, he noted, had established a committee to investigate issues in the cocoa sector, promising that Ghanaians would soon see the consequences of the previous administration’s decisions.</p>



<p>Mr Asiedu Nketia made the call during a thank-you tour in the Twifo Atti-Morkwa of the Central Region.</p>



<p>He urged farmers to remain patient, noting that the current NDC government has prudent policies for them.</p>



<p>Central Regional NDC Chairman, Mr Richard Kofi Asiedu, encouraged the people to continue supporting the NDC in the next election.</p>



<p>The two visited various constituencies in the region to express gratitude for their strong voter turnout in the 2024 general elections.</p>



<p>The District Chief Executive for Twifo-Atti-Mokwa, Isaac Yawson, said the government would not overlook development in the Central Region, noting the imminent completion of two legacy projects, including a school building and market stores initiated by the previous administration in the area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Work on the expansion and rehabilitation of the runway at the Kotoka International Airport (KIA) is progressing steadily, with authorities confident the project will significantly enhance Ghana’s aviation capacity, safety standards and long-term competitiveness.</p>



<p>The ongoing works, which include widening the runway from 60 metres to 75 metres, resurfacing its entire length, and upgrading critical lighting systems, are designed to accommodate larger aircraft, increase passenger throughput, and meet growing domestic and international aviation demand.</p>



<p>Yvonne Nana Afriyie Opare, Managing Director of the Ghana Airports Company Limited (GACL), says the project is forward-looking and essential to ensuring that Ghana’s main international gateway remains fit for purpose over the next decade and beyond.</p>



<p>“We have a growing population and more aircraft and passengers arriving daily. Projects like this must be future-oriented, ensuring the runway remains fit for purpose 10 years from now,” she said.</p>



<p>Mrs Opare was speaking during a working visit by the GACL Board to inspect the runway expansion and other infrastructure projects, including the new head office complex, currently under construction.</p>



<p>She explained that the runway was last repaired about 30 years ago, far exceeding the standard lifespan of such works.</p>



<p>“Normally, the lifespan of every runway repair is about 15 years based on ICAO standards. Now, after 30 years, it is time for an overlay and expansion,” she explained.</p>



<p>The project includes resurfacing the entire runway, extending the shoulders by 7.5 metres on each side, and upgrading the Airfield Ground Lighting (AGL) system to enhance night-time operations and overall safety.</p>



<p>A 100-metre trial section of the runway has already been completed, with night works ongoing to minimise disruptions to flight schedules.</p>



<p>When completed, the upgraded runway will meet Category 4F standards, enabling KIA to handle large aircraft such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 787, and substantially boost the airport’s operational efficiency. The project is scheduled for completion by July 2027.</p>



<p>Mr James Agalga, Board Chairman of GACL, commended the project team for the pace and professionalism demonstrated so far, describing the progress as impressive.</p>



<p>“The works are on schedule. The speed and professionalism are commendable. From the runway to the head office building, the progress is impressive, and we look forward to the timely delivery of all commitments,” he said.</p>



<p>Mr Ehud Deri, Director in charge of the project being executed by the contractor, Amandi, said about 150 workers were currently on site, supported by the consultant, Devotec.</p>



<p>He said careful coordination of manpower, procurement processes and equipment delivery was critical to meeting the project timelines.</p>



<p>“Every night’s work is carefully planned, with each task measured to ensure no mistakes. This project requires precision and rapid deployment,” Mr Deri said.</p>



<p>Alongside the runway works, construction of GACL’s new head office complex is also progressing steadily.</p>



<p>The project comprises two underground basements with 160 parking spaces and a 10-storey building above ground, designed to enhance operational efficiency and staff capacity.</p>



<p>The combined projects are expected to significantly strengthen Ghana’s aviation infrastructure, enhance the passenger experience, and position KIA as a more competitive hub for air travel in the West African subregion.</p>



<p>Other members of the Board are Attah Issah – MP for Sagnarigu Constituency, William Ntebe Ayo – MP for Tatale-Sanguli Constituency, Mark William Attipoe, Ministry of Transport, Kwabena Amponsah Dapaah – Fellow, Ghana Institution of Surveyors, Diana Amakie Ashong – Business Executive, Yvonne Nana Afriyie Opare – Managing Director, GACL, Air Commodore Elvis King Arneson Representative, Ghana Air Force andMr Joseph Enimil-Armah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Parliament is set to consider a constitutional amendment that could allow dual citizens to occupy key public offices in Ghana.</p>



<p>The Constitution of Ghana (Amendment) Bill, 2025, seeks to remove existing restrictions that bar persons with dual citizenship or allegiance to another country from holding positions such as Ambassador or High Commissioner, Secretary to the Cabinet, Chief of Defence Staff, and Inspector-General of Police.</p>



<p>The Bill, which has undergone its First Reading, was on Tuesday referred to the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee of Parliament for detailed consideration by Bernard Ahiafor, the First Deputy Speaker of Parliament.</p>



<p>Proponents argue that the amendment would enable Ghana to harness the skills and expertise of its diaspora community, thereby promoting inclusive governance and national development.</p>



<p>“This is not about questioning anyone’s loyalty. It’s about recognising the realities of the world we live in today and allowing capable Ghanaians to take up leadership roles,” Davis Ansah Opoku, New Patriotic Party Member of Parliament for Mpraeso and co-sponsor of the Bill, stated.</p>



<p>The proposed amendment has attracted support from various quarters, with advocates saying it could strengthen Ghana’s democracy and enhance representation.</p>



<p>However, some critics have raised concerns about national security and the risk of divided loyalties.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nana Oye Bampoe-Addo, Deputy Chief of Staff, has described the ‘reset agenda’ as more than a political slogan, but a deliberate call to rebuild trust in governance, reform institutions, and reset the place of women in Leadership.</p>



<p>She emphasised that the reset agenda was inherently a ‘gender agenda’ and reflected President John Dramani Mahama’s firm confidence in women&#8217;s capacity to lead.</p>



<p>“The reset agenda is a gender agenda, and President Mahama has clearly demonstrated utmost confidence in the women’s leadership agenda.”</p>



<p>Nana Oye Bampoe-Addo made the remarks at the 2nd Annual Conference for Women in Leadership in the Public Sector under the auspices of the Public Services Commission on the theme: “Breaking Barriers, Building Impact: Advancing Women’s Leadership in the Resetting Ghana Agenda”.</p>



<p>She called for critical reflection on progress in breaking barriers and building impact for women, particularly within the public sector, which was the centre of governance.</p>



<p>Data from the Public Services Commission show that women currently occupy 26 per cent of managerial positions in the public sector.</p>



<p>Although the judiciary has had three consecutive female Chief Justices, there are currently four women among 19 Justices at the Supreme Court, representing approximately 21 per cent.</p>



<p>She indicated that women accounted for 23.21 per cent of political appointments, and that government was working towards meeting the statutory thresholds under the Affirmative Action Gender Equity Act, which stipulate 30 per cent female representation by 2026, 35 per cent by 2028, and 50 per cent by 2030.</p>



<p>“These targets are not merely symbolic; they are a national obligation,” she emphasised.</p>



<p>She mentioned the appointments of Madam Daniella Mawusi Ntow Sarpong as the first female Chief Fire Officer, Madam Patience Baffoe-Bonnie as head of the Ghana Prisons Service, Professor Naana Jane Opoku-Agyeman’s nomination as the first female Vice President and others as clear evidence that the Reset Agenda was producing measurable change rather than symbolic commitments.</p>



<p>The Deputy Chief of Staff and a human rights lawyer urged women to embrace personal leadership, stressing that leadership was defined not by title but by impact and service.</p>



<p>She also encouraged transformational leadership, calling on women to inspire institutions and build legacies that would outlive their tenure.</p>



<p>The Women in Leadership Conference is part of the PSC&#8217;s commitment to promoting excellence in governance and advancing gender mainstreaming in the public sector.</p>



<p>Participants were drawn from women in positions such as Chief Directors, Chief Executive Officers, directors, managers, and analogous grades in the public sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Vice President Professor Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang, on Wednesday, urged public service agencies to ensure that recruitment, promotions, and appointments to positions are gender-responsive, transparent, and merit-based.</p>



<p>This may be accomplished by cultivating organisational cultures that prioritise merits, fairness, and inclusivity over tokenism and flexible working arrangements.</p>



<p>The Vice President, speaking at the opening of the second annual conference for Women in Leadership in the public sector in Accra, noted that the government was committed to implementing the Affirmative Action and Gender Equity law.</p>



<p>In line with that, the government has expanded the National Archives Insurance School to be more inclusive and financially sustainable, and has launched other economic empowerment initiatives, such as the Women’s Economic Resilience Initiative.</p>



<p>We have also launched other initiatives to broaden women’s access to capital, digital finance tools, and markets, while increasing women’s inclusion in strategic sectors and value chains.</p>



<p>According to the Vice President, these were deliberate policy measures and concrete steps toward a Ghana where women had fairer access to opportunities and could overcome barriers to their advancement and growth.</p>



<p>Prof. Opoku-Agyemang challenged female public service officers not to yield to biases and stereotypes, adding, “act with boldness, act with clarity, act with purpose.”</p>



<p>“To my fellow females, as I said, don’t be intimidated, it is not about making yourself in other people’s image. It is not about your hairline. It is not about your eyebrow It is not about the hair you do not like. It is about impact; it is about staying true to the values.”</p>



<p>The day’s conference is themed “Breaking Barriers, Building Impact: Advancing Women’s Leadership in the Resetting Ghana Agenda.”</p>



<p>As part of its commitment to promoting excellence in governance and advancing Gender mainstreaming in the Public Sector, the Public Services Commission is organising the Women in Leadership conference.</p>



<p>The Conference is designed to empower women holding Leadership positions, such as Chief Directors, Chief Executive Officers, Directors, managers, and analogous grades, in the public sector.</p>



<p>The Conference, among other things, sought to further enhance women leaders&#8217; capabilities and position the sector to lead in implementing the Affirmative Action and Gender Equity law.</p>



<p>Madam Lydia Lamisi Akanvariba, Minister of State in charge of Public Sector reforms, said comprehensive reforms to achieve Gender balance in staffing and leadership in the Public sector were ready to be rolled out.</p>



<p>She said the designation of Gender Desk Officers across all government institutions, agencies, and departments was a deliberate step to lead gender mainstreaming initiatives.</p>



<p>Earlier, Ms Nana Oye Bampoe-Addo, Deputy Chief of Staff, said the government was steadily moving towards achieving the targets of the Affirmative Action and Gender Equity law, and President Mahama had clearly demonstrated utmost confidence towards women’s leadership.</p>



<p>She urged women not to let stereotypes and discrimination silence them in their pursuit of leadership roles, noting that the law protects them.</p>



<p>“The law protects you to lead, stand firmly on it and work diligently”, she emphasised.</p>
